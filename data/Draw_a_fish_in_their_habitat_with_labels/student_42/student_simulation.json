  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the shape of a fish. I remember that a fish is kind of oval with a pointy bit at the front for its mouth and a tail at the end. The tail is like a triangle. I’ll add a couple of fins on the top and bottom that are sort of like curved triangles too. My fish doesn't have a lot of details, but I think it looks like a fish. Now, I’ll put the fish in the water. I know fish live in the water, so I’ll draw a wavy line above the fish for the water surface. I’ll also draw some lines for water plants around the fish; they are like straight sticks with little oval leaves, but I’m not very sure how many to draw. I'll label the fish as 'fish', and the water plants can be labeled as 'plants'. For the water, I might write 'watir', I think that’s how it's spelled. I won't add any food or other animals because I’m not sure what they eat. I wish I knew more about how the fish lived or what they eat, but I don't really know how to show that.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child's drawing of a fish in a pond. The fish is oval-shaped with a triangle for a tail and triangle-like fins. The fish is under a wavy line representing the water surface. There are a few basic water plants around, depicted as straight lines with oval leaves. The labels include 'fish', 'plants', and 'watir', with simple, blocky text. The drawing uses basic colors, like blue for water, green for plants, and grey for the fish, using a crayon style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by illustrating a recognizable yet simplistic fish shape, placing it in a straightforward water environment with basic plant representations. Labels for the fish and immediate surroundings are included with some spelling errors. The image doesn't include complex relationships, additional resources like food sources, or any systems-thinking elements, aligning with what the student cannot do."
