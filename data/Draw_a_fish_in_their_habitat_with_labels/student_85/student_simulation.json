  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I know fish live in water, so I'll start with a big shape that looks like a blob. That's my fish. Fish need water, so I'll add some wavy lines around the fish to show the water. I think fish swim in places like a pond or ocean, but I’m not sure how to label that, so I’ll just write 'home' because that’s where it might live. Now, I'll add some other things around it. I’ll draw a triangle above my fish; maybe it’s a mountain or a rock. I'll put a circle over there, but I'm not really sure what it should be, maybe just another rock or something. I need to label the fish. I'll just write 'fish' next to it. I won't add any food or plants because I don't know what exactly they eat or what the water plants look like.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing featuring a large, simple blob-like shape in blue representing a fish. Surrounding the fish are wavy blue lines to symbolize water. In the background, there is a triangle shape and a circle that appear random. The label 'fish' is written near the blob. The word 'home' is placed above the scene. The drawing is colorful, using simple shapes and a naive style typical of a very young child's art.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's limited understanding by featuring an oversimplified fish shape and random shapes that don't accurately depict a habitat. The fish is not interacting with any habitat elements, such as food or plants, consistent with the student's inability to show how the ecosystem works together. The label of 'home' for the habitat shows a lack of understanding of specific water bodies. The 'blob' shape and lack of detail in additional elements align with the student's drawing ability at their level."
