  "Reasoning": "First, I need to draw a fish. I remember fish have fins and a tail, so I will make sure to include those. I'll draw a simple fish shape with a big oval body, a triangle tail, and some fins. I'll add a big eye so it's clear it's a fish. Next, I'll draw some water around the fish to show its habitat. I know fish live in water, but I'm not sure whether to label it as a lake or ocean, so I'll just draw plain blue water without specifying. I'll make some wavy lines for water near the fish. I should add some plants because fish need those, but I just know they are 'plants' and cannot remember specific types, so I'll just draw some simple green seaweed or grass shapes and label them 'plants'. Finally, I'll write 'fish' next to the fish and 'water' near the wavy lines. I think that's good for showing that fish live in a habitat with water.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a child-like drawing of a simple fish in a basic water habitat. The fish has an oval body, a triangle tail, and fins, with a big eye to make it recognizable. The water is shown as wavy blue lines around the fish, indicating a generic body of water. There are simple green plant shapes nearby, labeled as 'plants'. The fish itself is labeled 'fish', and the water is labeled 'water'. The drawing should use basic colors like blue and green, with a naive and simplistic drawing style, representing an emerging understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's 'developing' level by including basic elements like a fish in water and simple labels, reflecting the student's ability to identify the fish and the habitat. It does not include specific plant types or other living/non-living things, aligning with the student's limitations in differentiating specific elements and understanding deeper ecological relationships."
