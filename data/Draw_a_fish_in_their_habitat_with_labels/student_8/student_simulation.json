  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big fish in the center of my paper. I remember that fish have fins and scales, so I'll sketch out some fins and add little scales all over its body. Fish live in water, so I need to draw a watery environment. I'll draw some wavy lines to show the water, and maybe bubbles to represent air. The fish needs oxygen from the water, so I'll add a bubble and label it 'oxygen'. Next, I remember there are other things in a fish's habitat. I'll draw some seaweed and label it, as fish need plants around them. There should be other fish too, so I'll draw a smaller fish swimming near the big one. Fish eat plankton or smaller fish, so I'll draw some tiny dots and label them as plankton, and add a note about the fish eating smaller fish. Now, I'll label my big fish, the fins, the scales, the water, the bubbles, the smaller fish, and the seaweed to make sure I've got everything important. I almost forgot about sunlight, but I know it's not crucial right now. I think I'm done!",
  "Prompt": "A childâ€™s drawing showing a large fish with fins and scales in an aquatic habitat. The water is represented by wavy blue lines and bubbles labeled 'oxygen'. There is green seaweed, a smaller fish, and small dots labeled 'plankton'. Each element is clearly labeled in a childish handwriting. The drawing style is colorful and naive, showing a simplistic, cartoon-like representation with emphasis on clarity and distinct elements of the ecosystem, like fish, water, bubbles, and plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to accurately depict and label a fish and its environment, including key features of the habitat and relationships with other organisms. The student can indicate resources like oxygen and food (plankton), showcasing the level of understanding expected at an advanced level. Minor omissions, such as the lack of sunlight label, align with areas the student might overlook, maintaining a balance between an accurate understanding of the ecosystem and minor, non-essential details."
