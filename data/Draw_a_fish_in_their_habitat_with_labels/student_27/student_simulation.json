  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the body of water first, like a lake, because that’s where the fish lives. I remember the water should look wavy because it's not still. Next, I’ll draw a fish in the water. I know that fish have fins, a tail, and a curvy body, so I’ll make sure those parts are there. I should label the fish and the water to show what they are. Now, for the habitat, I think I should add some plants like seaweed because I remember that fish sometimes hide in those. I’ll draw some wavy, long lines next to the fish and label them. I should also think about what the fish eats, so I'll add a couple of small fish around and label them. I might forget to show things like oxygen because it's invisible, and I'm not sure exactly how to include interactions like that, but I’ll add arrows around the fish to show movement because I know that’s important for showing how it swims.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a lake with a fish swimming in it. The fish has a curvy body, fins, and tail, and is labeled 'fish'. The water appears wavy and is labeled 'water'. To the side, there are long, wavy green plants labeled 'seaweed'. Near the fish, there are smaller fish labeled with a name like 'food'. Arrows are around the fish to show movement. The drawing is colorful, with blues and greens, and is done in a simple, child-like style, reflecting a grade-level artistic ability.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do, like drawing a fish and labeling the basic components of the habitat such as the water and seaweed. The student can show aspects of the fish's environment and its movement. However, it also reflects what the student struggles with, such as not including detailed ecosystem interactions or invisible elements like oxygen, consistent with their proficiency level."
