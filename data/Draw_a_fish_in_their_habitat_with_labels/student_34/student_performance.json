  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not connect the fish to the water as a resource in a meaningful way (e.g., not linking fish survival to water).",
    "The student might draw other animals but fail to label what resources they need (e.g., not labeling sunlight for plants).",
    "The student might inconsistently apply labels or mix them up (e.g., labeling water as 'air' or plant as 'fish food').",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate how all parts of the habitat work together to support living things (e.g., not showing interaction between fish and plants)."
