  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat and make sure to label things. First, I'll draw a big blue oval to show the water because that's where the fish lives. I'll put a fish inside the water, making it look like it's swimming. I remember that I need to label the water, so I'll write 'water' next to it because fish need water. Now I'll try to draw a plant because I think plants are important in the habitat too. I'll make the plant green and label it 'plant'. I know plants need sunlight, but I'm not sure where to put the sun, and I forgot to label it. Maybe I'll draw another fish too, but I'm not sure what else to label or how everything else needs the water. I’m worried I'll mix up some labels, but I'll do my best to fit them in there.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish is swimming in a large blue oval shape representing water, labeled 'water'. There is a green plant nearby the fish, labeled 'plant'. The style is colorful and simple, resembling a child's drawing with thick, uneven lines. There are a few disjointed bubbles in the water, and another fish nearby with no label. Some labels might be incorrectly placed or missing.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes the drawing of a fish in water and labels the water as a resource, which the student can do. The prompt also reflects the student's level by including a plant with a label, even if other elements aren't fully connected, accurately showing how the student doesn’t meaningfully connect resources or show interaction between habitat elements."
