  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll start with the fish. I remember that a fish has a simple shape, kind of like an oval, so I'll draw an oval shape for the body and add a triangle shape for the tail fin. I should also add some simple lines for the fins. I'll label it 'Fish' since it's the living thing in the drawing. Now, I need to show that it lives in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines around the fish to represent the water and label it as 'Water'. I've learned that fish live with other things like plants and rocks, too. I'll try to draw some long lines with leaves for plants and some rounded shapes for rocks. I think plants and rocks are important for the habitat, but I'm not always sure about labeling those parts, so I might leave them without labels. I know these things help the fish somehow, like with food and space, but I feel like I don't always remember to add those pieces or label them in my picture. I also remember that these things are connected, but I'm not really sure how to show that in my drawing, so I'll just have each part separate.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a simple fish in a watery habitat. The fish is an oval shape with a triangle tail and basic fins, labeled 'Fish'. Surrounding the fish are wavy lines representing water, labeled 'Water'. There are some attempts at drawing plants with long stems and leaves, and rocks as simple rounded shapes, but they are unlabeled. The drawing is colorful with a focus on blue for water, a silver or gray fish, and green plants. This should be a basic, naive style drawing showing emerging understanding, typical of a developing studentâ€™s work.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can and cannot do by including a clearly drawn and labeled fish and water. The inclusion of unlabeled plants and rocks reflects the student's struggle with consistently labeling other parts of the habitat. The prompt also captures the student's basic attempt to understand the interconnectedness of the habitat, though it does not explicitly show interaction due to the student's developing level of understanding."
