  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish! I know fish live in water, so I’m going to draw some wavy lines for the water first. That makes sense, right? I think I’ll put the fish above the waves. I think fish are kind of oval-shaped, so I’ll draw an oval and give it some fins and a tail. Oh, I should add an eye, too! I remember that fish need water, so I’ll label the water as 'water'. I'm not sure what else to add, maybe I’ll label the fish as 'fish'. I don't remember what else should be in the water, so I’ll leave that part empty.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a fish with an oval body, basic fins, and a single eye, positioned above wavy blue lines simulating water. The drawing is done with basic colored pencils or crayons, with the fish colored in a solid tone and labeled as 'fish'. The wavy lines are labeled as 'water'. The background is mostly white, with no other details like plants or rocks. The overall style is child-like and simplistic, reflecting a minimal understanding of the fish's habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the student's ability to draw a basic fish shape and approximate water using wavy lines. The fish is incorrectly placed above the water line, illustrating the misunderstanding that fish need water to swim. The prompt reflects the child's capability to label parts ('fish', 'water'), which aligns with their skill level. The absence of additional habitat elements like plants or rocks shows a lack of understanding of the fish's environment, consistent with the cannot do aspects."
