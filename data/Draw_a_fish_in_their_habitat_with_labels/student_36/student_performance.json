  "Topic": "Draw a fish in their habitat with labels.",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a fish and another living thing in a water-based habitat, such as a frog in a pond environment.",
    "The student can label the habitat as a specific type of water body such as an ocean or river and show other animals or plants that coexist there.",
    "The student can show and label essential survival needs like water and food for the fish, such as algae or smaller fish.",
    "The student can illustrate and label parts of the habitat that provide resources for the fish, such as aquatic plants for shelter and smaller fish or insects as food sources.",
    "The student can adequately illustrate connections between the habitat and the needs of the fish, demonstrating how the habitat fulfills these needs (e.g., fish gills labeled to show how fish take in oxygen from water).",
    "The student can effectively demonstrate through the drawing how the elements of the habitat, including fish and other living things, interact as a cohesive system."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit or misspell specific labels for some elements, but generally corrects them after review.",
    "A slight inconsistency may occur in showing the proportional size of habitat elements (e.g., drawing fish much larger than surrounding plants without clear intent), but this does not significantly hinder understanding."
