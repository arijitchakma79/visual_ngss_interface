  "Reasoning": "To start my drawing, I’ll begin by sketching a fish, like a trout, with its gills showing to demonstrate how it breathes underwater. I'll make sure to label the gills so it’s clear. Next, I'll draw a pond because that’s a specific type of water body and make sure to label it clearly. I remember that fish like trout eat smaller fish and insects, so I’ll add a couple of those tiny fish and label them too. I'll include some aquatic plants like cattails and lily pads around the fish, labeling them as ‘shelter’ since fish need places to hide and live. I know these things are important for the fish in this pond habitat. Making sure the pond looks lively, I'll add a frog sitting on a lily pad and a couple of snails on the pond floor to show a cohesive system of living things. As I do this, I might accidentally draw the fish a bit too large, but I will try to adjust it. While labeling, I will double-check the spellings because sometimes I misspell. Overall, the drawing should show how the fish and the pond environment meet the needs of the fish for survival.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful and detailed drawing of a fish habitat. In the center is a trout with noticeable gills labeled 'gills.' It swims in a pond, labeled 'pond,' rich with details. Surrounding the trout are smaller labeled fish and a few insects. Aquatic plants like cattails and lily pads are included, labeled as 'shelter', providing habitat connections. A frog sits on a lily pad with a few snails on the pond floor. The sizes are slightly inconsistent with the fish a bit larger than the surrounding plants. Labels are legible and mostly accurate. The drawing is colored with greens, blues, and earth tones, in a clean and organized style suitable for a 4th-grade advanced level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by including accurate representations of a fish in a pond habitat, other living things, and labels for habitat elements. It shows understanding of interactions as a system. The slight size inconsistency and potential spelling errors match the difficulties the student might face but do not diminish the clarity of the overall drawing."
