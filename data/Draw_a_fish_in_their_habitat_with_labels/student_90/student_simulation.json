  "Reasoning": "I know I need to draw a fish, so I'll start by drawing a simple fish shape. I'll make it look kind of like an oval with a tail. I think fish live in water, so I'll draw a big blob around the fish and label it 'water'. I know there are other things in the water too, so I'll add another small fish next to it. I think seaweed is a plant that grows underwater, so I'll draw some wavy lines to be seaweed and label it 'plant'. I'm not sure what else the fish needs to live, but I remember they might need food and maybe air, but I don't know how to show that very well. I'll just focus on getting the fish and water right, but I won't add any specific details on how the fish eats or breathes.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple child's artwork featuring a fish in a blue body of water. Include another small fish and some wavy green lines representing a plant. The fish and plant should be labeled 'fish' and 'plant' respectively. Use basic colors and a simple, hand-drawn style, typical of a young student's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's emerging understanding by focusing on the basic elements the student can include: a fish, water, and another living thing like a plant. The drawing lacks detailed elements such as food or air, which align with the student's struggles to depict the complete ecosystem or the fish's needs for survival, as per the task requirements."
