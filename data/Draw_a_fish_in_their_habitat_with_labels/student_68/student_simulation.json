  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I’ll sketch a big fish swimming in the middle of the page. It's important to get the shape right so that it looks like a real fish with fins and a tail. I'll label the fish, and I'll make sure to write 'fish' next to it. Next, I’ll need to show where the fish lives, so I'll draw some water around it. I remember that fish need water to survive, so I'll label the water too. Now, I want to add some plants like seaweed because I know fish often hide among plants. I'll draw tall, wavy plants at the bottom and label them 'seaweed'. It’s really important to include light because it's something all living things need, so I’ll draw the sunlight coming through the water and write 'sunlight'. I should think about what else is in this habitat, like rocks on the bottom, but sometimes I mix up whether to call them rocks or stones. I’ll just draw them and not worry too much about labeling each one exactly. Finally, I’ll add a few smaller fishes and maybe some bubbles to show the environment is full of life.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of an underwater scene featuring a large, accurately detailed fish swimming in the center. The fish is labeled 'fish'. Surrounding the fish, there is clear blue water labeled 'water'. At the bottom of the drawing, there are tall, wavy green seaweed plants labeled 'seaweed'. Above the water, rays of sunlight penetrate through, labeled 'sunlight'. The sketch includes smaller fish, various aquatic plants, and rocks, with an omission of specific plant species or rock labeling. The drawing is realistic and vibrant, showcasing an advanced understanding of the aquatic environment.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it includes an accurate and labeled representation of the fish and its necessary resources, like water and sunlight. It also includes seaweed as part of the habitat with appropriate labeling. The student shows their understanding of how fish interact with their environment by depicting them swimming and hiding. However, the prompt also reflects what the student struggles with, like not labeling minor ecosystem elements such as specific types of rocks, complying with the 'cannot' section."
