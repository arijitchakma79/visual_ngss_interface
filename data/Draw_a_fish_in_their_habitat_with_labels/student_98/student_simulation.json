  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a fish, because that's the main thing. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines to show the water around it. I remember that sometimes there is seaweed or plants in the water, so I'll add one plant next to the fish. Now, I should label the fish and the water at least. I'll write 'fish' near the fish, and 'water' near the water. I'm having trouble thinking about what else I should label. I think fish eat, but I'm not sure what they would eat or where I would draw it, so I’ll just leave that out. I'll try to make sure the fish is at least in the water. It’s hard to think if I should add clouds or how the water helps the fish, so I won’t add those.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like illustration of a fish in a water environment. The fish is positioned in blue wavy lines representing the water. Next to the fish, draw one simple green plant or seaweed. Label the fish with 'fish' and the water with 'water'. Keep the style colorful and aligned with a developing learning level, focusing on basic shapes and simplicity.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing exercise captures what the student can do by including the fish in a water setting with basic elements like water and one plant. The student struggles are represented by the limited labeling with just 'fish' and 'water', and no additional environmental labels. This reflects their emerging understanding, as they did not show connections between the fish and habitat beyond basic components."
