  "Topic": "Draw a fish in their habitat with labels.",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a fish in a generic water setting without specific habitat details.",
    "The student can include and label a few basic aspects of the habitat, such as water and one or two plants.",
    "The student can show and label water as a resource the fish needs."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently illustrate or label specific habitat features accurately (e.g., labels are either missing for some elements, or incorrect with plants labeled as 'rocks').",
    "The student is likely to struggle with showing other living things in the habitat or may include them without labels (e.g., unlabelled plant or animal sketches).",
    "The student may not clearly represent the relationships between the fish and its environment (e.g., fish might be placed above the water or not positioned naturally due to spatial misunderstandings).",
    "The student might not demonstrate a full understanding that the fish, habitat, and resources form an interconnected system (e.g., elements depicted as isolated rather than part of a system)."
