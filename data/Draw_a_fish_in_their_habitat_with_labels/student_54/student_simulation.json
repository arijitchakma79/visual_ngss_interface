  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I know fish live in water, so I should draw a lot of blue around it to show the water. Next, I'll try to add a plant because fish live with plants. I’ve seen pictures where fish swim near green plants, so I’ll draw a tall green plant next to the fish. I remember fish need water to survive, so I’ll put the word 'water' near the blue to label it. I want to add more habitat features like rocks or animals, but I’m not sure how to do that right. Maybe I could add another plant, but I might call it something else by mistake. I drew the fish swimming in the air by accident before, so this time, I’ll make sure it’s inside the blue water. Let’s label the plant as 'plant' so I know what it is even though I’m still confused about how to show all the things fish need like food and other animals. I should try to focus on the fish, water, and plant.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing of a simple fish submerged in a large blue area representing water. Include a tall, basic green plant next to the fish, labeled correctly as 'plant'. The water should be labeled as 'water'. Use bold, simple lines and bright colors to reflect a young student's drawing style. Avoid detailed or accurate depictions of specific habitat elements or complex interactions. The overall drawing should focus on the fish, water, and one plant, without other specific aquatic features or labeled animals nearby.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's emerging understanding. They can draw and label basic elements like water and a plant, but struggle with accurate depiction and labeling of specific habitat features. The style is simple with bright colors, aligning with the student's developing skill level. The fish and its habitat are isolated elements due to the student's spatial misunderstandings, reflecting a level 2 understanding."
