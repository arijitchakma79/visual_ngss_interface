  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I’ll start with the fish. I think a fish looks like a long oval shape, so I'll draw a big oval. Fishes have tails, so I’ll add a triangle at one end of the oval for the tail. I remember fish have fins too, so I'll draw a couple of pointy things on the back. That's all I know about drawing a fish. Now, for the habitat, fish live in water, right? I’ll draw a big wavy line near the bottom of the page to show the water. I think that's good enough for the fish's home. I know I’m supposed to label the parts, but I can’t remember what they’re called, so I might just write some letters or words I know. Above the fish, I'll just scribble something. I’m not sure what other plants or animals to add because I'm not sure what else lives in the water with fish.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, somewhat rough illustration of a single fish in its habitat. The fish is represented by an elongated oval shape with a triangle for a tail and a few small triangles or lines for fins. The fish lacks details or correct proportions. Add a simple wave line at the bottom of the image to represent water. There are no other plants or animals shown. The fish does not interact with the habitat or show any kind of movement. Include random letters or simple words scattered above the fish to resemble labels, though they are unrelated to the fish parts. Use basic colors such as blue for the water and a single color like gray or light blue for the fish. The drawing style should be naive and childlike, reflecting the limited understanding of a young student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'can do' by having the student create a simple fish shape and includes a basic wave line to represent water. It aligns with 'cannot do' because the fish lacks detailed proportions, and labels are incorrect or unrelated. Additionally, no other plants or animals are included in the habitat, and the fish doesn’t interact with its environment, following the student's limited understanding as described."
