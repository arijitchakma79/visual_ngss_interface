  "Reasoning": "I remember that my task is to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll draw the fish. I know fish have a long body and a tail, so I'll start with that. I'll make it look like a simple fish shape with scales and a fin on the top. Now I need to think about where the fish lives. Fish live in water, so I’ll draw a blob shape around the fish to represent water and label it 'water'. I think fish eat food to survive, so I'm going to draw some circles that look like little bits of food next to the fish. I'll try to label it 'food', but I'm not exactly sure if fish eat this kind of food. I'm not sure what else the fish needs, but it probably swims around, so maybe that's all I need to add. I'm not very sure what else lives in the water with the fish, like plants or rocks, so I’ll leave those out for now.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing of a fish swimming in water. The fish has a simple oval shape with a visible tail and fin, filled with basic colors like blue and orange. Around the fish is water, marked with the word 'water' written in a child's handwriting. Nearby the fish are small circular dots labeled 'food'. The drawing is simple with a basic, cartoonish style, without details like rocks, plants, or other environmental elements.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities and gaps perfectly. The student draws a clear representation of a fish and identifies the water habitat, even if it's only labeled as 'water'. They attempt to show an element like food, but it's not depicted or labeled accurately. The gaps are reflected in the lack of ecosystem elements like plants or rocks, and there's no insight into the broader habitat dynamics, aligning well with the outlined 'cannot do' items."
