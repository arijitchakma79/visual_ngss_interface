  "Topic": "Draw a fish in their habitat with labels.",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can include a basic representation of a fish in their drawing, indicating awareness of fish living in water environments.",
    "The student can draw and label water as the habitat where the fish lives, although the label might be simply marked as 'water'.",
    "The student can attempt to show an element of what the fish needs to survive, such as food, but may only partially label or illustrate it."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly identify or label all essential needs for the fish, such as missing oxygen or mislabeled food sources (student may not understand all survival needs yet).",
    "The student might not include or label other parts of the fish's environment like plants or rocks correctly, or they could omit them entirely (student unsure of connections or importance).",
    "The student is unlikely to represent how the fish is part of a larger ecosystem, potentially showing isolated elements without clear interactions (student has not developed system-level thinking).",
    "The student might inaccurately or vaguely describe the connection between the fish and its habitat, such as incorrectly stating how it obtains resources or survives (misunderstands habitat dynamics)."
