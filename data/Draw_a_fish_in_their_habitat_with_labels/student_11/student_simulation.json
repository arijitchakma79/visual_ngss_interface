  "Reasoning": "First, I'm going to draw a fish that's swimming in its home. I know fish live in water, so I will draw some blue waves to show the water. After I draw the fish's body, I'll label it 'Fish.' Now, I need to draw the environment around the fish. I'll make some green underwater plants and label them 'Plants,' as fish need them for protection. I should draw another type of fish or animal - maybe a crab at the bottom and label it 'Crab.' I will add rocks to the bottom of the habitat, but I might forget to label them. I know fish need water to survive, so I'll label the area above with the waves 'Water.' Maybe I could add more details, like tiny plants or bubbles, but I'm not really sure how to label those or what they are exactly for the fish. I remember that fish sometimes hide or play around rocks, but I'm not sure how to show that here.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of a fish in a natural water environment. The fish should have clear features and be labeled 'Fish.' The water is represented by wavy blue lines. Include underwater plants colored green with the label 'Plants.' Add a small crab at the bottom of the habitat, labeled 'Crab.' Rocks are drawn at the bottom but are not labeled. The label 'Water' is placed near the top. The drawing should have a playful, child-like style with broad, simple lines and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency in illustrating and labeling most key components like the fish, water, and plants. While the student includes additional creatures like a crab, rocks are either unlabeled or labels are inconsistent, reflecting their occasional struggles. The overall style is reflective of a comprehensive yet somewhat simplified understanding, typical of a proficient level student."
