  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the fish. I remember it should have fins, gills, and a tail, so I'll make sure to label each of them. I'll draw the fish swimming in the water and add labels like 'water' and maybe some waves to show movement. Next, I'll think about the fish's habitat. I remember that I need to draw other living things too, so I'll add some aquatic plants and maybe a frog near the water's edge. I should label the plants and the frog as well. The task wants me to compare habitats, so on the side, I’ll sketch a simple tree and label it as a bird's habitat. I understand fish need water to live and gills help them breathe oxygen, so I’ll write that down somewhere on the drawing. I’ve noticed I sometimes forget to label everything or explain some parts, like what the plants do, so I need to watch out for that. This time, I think I covered most labels, but I didn't remember to explain the plant's role in making oxygen.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful illustration of a fish in its water habitat. The fish should have labeled parts: fins, gills, and tail. Use shades of blue for the water with gentle waves and label it. Include aquatic plants labeled in green and a frog on the edge of the water. Next to the fish habitat, draw a tree with a labeled bird, contrasting the fish's habitat with a land-based one. Add annotations for how the fish uses water and gills for oxygen. The style should be a child’s drawing with clear and straightforward labels for each element.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's capability to draw and label a fish's parts accurately and to depict a variety of living things like plants and frogs in the habitat. The student also incorporates elements showing how habitats support living organisms, aligned with their CAN list. The prompt indicates that the student sometimes forgets to label nutrient sources like plant oxygen production, reflecting their occasional struggles, as noted in the CANNOT list. The prompt ensures an advanced level of detail with a playful, child-like artistic style to match their comprehension and presentation skills."
