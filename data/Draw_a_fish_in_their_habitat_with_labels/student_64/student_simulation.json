  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by sketching a fish, maybe like a salmon because I know they live in both rivers and oceans. I'll draw it with a sleek body and fins. Then, I'll add the habitat; let's make it a river with lots of water. I can add some aquatic plants like algae and maybe draw a few rocks at the bottom. I remember fish need these to survive. I’ll label the fish itself, pointing out its fins, gills, and tail. Next, I want to show and label some resources like clean water, which is really important for the fish. I'll illustrate and label air bubbles for oxygen because fish need it to breathe. In the river, I'll add sunlight coming through the water's surface — everything in a river habitat relies on it. I'll try to show how the fish is a part of this system, maybe by drawing a few small insects it might eat. I'll label these insects and the water plants. For the overall environment, I'm careful with colors: blue for water, green for plants, brown for rocks. I may forget to label one or two plant types specifically, but I'll cover most of what I know. I want to show how everything interacts, though perhaps I'll only highlight a few relations, like fish eating insects, rather than the whole ecosystem.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of a river habitat featuring a salmon with sleek body and fins. The river water is depicted in vibrant blue with gentle ripples. Along the riverbed, there are green algae and brown rocks. Sunlight streams through the water's surface, creating a bright effect. The salmon, swimming past, has clearly labeled parts: fins, gills, and tail. Nearby, small bubbles labeled as 'oxygen' float upwards. On plants, small insects are visible, providing food for the salmon, all properly labeled. The colors include blues, greens, browns, and the salmon is a silvery tone with darker scales. The drawing is realistic, includes precise labeling, and shows interaction of the fish within the interconnected ecosystem.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures the student's capacity to draw and label the fish and its habitat accurately, using specific terms for resources like water and air. The detailed setting of a river with plants and insects demonstrates the student's understanding of ecosystem interactions. However, potential minor omissions in labeling some plants reflect the student's occasional oversight. The overall image aligns with the student's ability to create a vivid and advanced-level representation while missing only minor details."
