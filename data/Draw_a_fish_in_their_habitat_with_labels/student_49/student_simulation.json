  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I’ll try to draw the fish. I know fish have a roundish body, so I'll draw a sort of oval shape. I think fish have some sort of a triangle at the back, like a tail, so I’ll add that. Now, fish have something on top... maybe it's like a triangle or a fin? I’ll draw a little triangle there too. Now, for the labels. Hmm, I'll just write 'fish' on the fish's body since that's what it is. I think that should be enough for the fish. Now, the habitat... uh, they live in water. I’ll draw some lines on top to show water, but I’m not sure where to label it or if I need to label anything else. I remember seeing some plants in water, but I'm not sure about them, so I’ll just skip it for now. I'll add blue color around for the water and keep the fish yellowish to stand out. It seems like enough for a fish in water.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, childish drawing of a basic oval-shaped yellow fish with a triangle tail and fin. The fish has the word 'fish' written on its body. Above the fish, there are wavy blue lines representing water. The scene is simple with a white background, drawn in a crayon style with minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes a basic representation of a fish with minimal features, which aligns with the student's ability to draw a basic shape and label it simply as 'fish'. The attempted representation of water with wavy lines shows the student's partial understanding, but they don't label it correctly, fulfilling the 'cannot' criteria of representing the habitat accurately. The omission of other habitat elements like plants or animals reflects the student's misunderstanding of the broader habitat concept."
