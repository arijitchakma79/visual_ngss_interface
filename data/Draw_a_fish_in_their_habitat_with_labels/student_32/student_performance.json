    "The student can accurately draw and label a fish and other animals living in a natural water habitat, showing clear distinctions between different species.",
    "The student can depict various bodies of water, such as lakes and oceans, where fish live, with labelled differentiation between them.",
    "The student can show essential survival elements like water, plants, and possibly other smaller organisms in the ecosystem with appropriate labels.",
    "The student can illustrate complex interactions between fish and their environment, showcasing details like fish feeding on plants or smaller organisms.",
    "The student can correctly label resources, such as the food and oxygen provided by plants, and habitat elements essential for survival.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally miss minor label details or make slightly unclear connections in dense areas of the drawing *(e.g., may miss labeling the type of plant)*.",
    "The student might underrepresent some less obvious interactions between ecosystem components*(e.g., decomposition processes or subtle environmental influences)*."
