  "Reasoning": "I'm starting with my drawing of a fish habitat. First, I'll draw a large fish in the center of the page, like a salmon, swimming in the water. I'll make sure to label it clearly as 'Salmon' using blue ink. Now, around the fish, I'll add some seaweed and label one of them 'Seaweed'. Iâ€™ll add smaller fish like minnows and label these too. To show diversity, I'll draw a crab at the bottom and label it. Next, I'll draw a line separating two parts of the water, labeling one 'Lake' and the other 'Ocean'. I'll depict fish in both to show the different environments they live in. I need to remember to show how fish interact with their environment, so I'll draw the salmon nibbling on the seaweed and label the seaweed as a 'Food Source'. I'll also add bubbles above the seaweed to indicate 'Oxygen'. On the side, I'll add some rocks and label them as part of the 'Habitat'. Finally, I'll add 'Water' labels, ensuring everything is clear. I feel confident in these elements, but I might've missed labeling a specific alga or something minor, and I know I won't include subtle details like decomposition perfectly.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of a natural water habitat with colorful pencils. Show a central salmon fish with blue labels, surrounded by seaweed, smaller fish like minnows, and a crab on the sandy bottom with detailed labels. Add a line between two water bodies, labeling them 'Lake' and 'Ocean'. Illustrate seaweed as a 'Food Source', with bubbles labeled as 'Oxygen'. Include rocks labeled as part of the 'Habitat', maintaining a realistic underwater ecosystem with accurate colors.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's capability to depict an accurate and detailed fish habitat with proper labeling, such as the different fish species and their environment. It also includes essential survival elements and interactions like feeding, which the student can represent well. However, it might miss some minor labeling details or complex interactions such as decomposition, consistent with what the student occasionally struggles to include."
