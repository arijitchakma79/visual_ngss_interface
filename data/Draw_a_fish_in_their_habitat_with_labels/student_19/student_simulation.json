  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm drawing a fish in its habitat. Let's start with the fish. I'll draw a big fish, like a goldfish, with a round body and a little tail. I'll make sure to label it 'fish'. Now, around the fish, I need to show its habitat. I'll draw some water by making wavy lines near the fish, and I'll label it 'water'. I remember that water is important for the fish's survival, so it's good to label that. To make it look more like a real habitat, I'll add some plants. Let's see, I'll draw a few bits of seaweed with long leaves stretching up. I should also label 'seaweed' to show it's there, although I might forget to label 'oxygen' or something about what the seaweed does. Oh, and maybe I'll add a small rock since I've seen those in aquariums. While drawing, I know that the fish needs resources around it, but I might not include how exactly the seaweed helps the fish with oxygen since I'm not sure about that connection.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, colorful drawing of a fish in its aquatic habitat. The fish is drawn in the style of a child's picture, with a round, orange body and a distinct label 'fish'. The background features blue wavy lines labeled 'water' to indicate its habitat. In the scene, there are also green, leafy seaweeds labeled 'seaweed' and a small gray rock. The drawing should be vibrant and clear yet basic, reflecting a third-grade level of proficiency with some minor details understated.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do, such as drawing and labeling a fish and water as the habitat. It includes plants, fitting their ability to represent some habitat details. The drawing doesn't elaborate on deeper connections like the role of seaweed in providing oxygen, which the student struggles with, reflecting their current proficiency level. The style and elements present represent their understanding and what they tend to omit."
