  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a fish. I remember that a fish has a body, fins, a tail, and gills, so I'll make sure to include and label those parts. Next, I need to think about where the fish lives. I’ve learned about different bodies of water, so I'll decide to draw a river. I'll illustrate the flowing water and label it as the fish's habitat. I remember how important it is for the fish to have water to swim and survive. Now, I need to add more details to show the fish's environment. I'll draw some plants, like seaweed, and rocks at the bottom of the river, and I’ll make sure to label them too. I noticed before that I sometimes forget to label every single plant, so I need to be careful. I'll draw the fish near the plants because fish often swim or hide around them. Lastly, I’ll add some other living things, like another small fish or a snail, to show interactions in the habitat, and label them as well. I won't focus on the sky or weather details since they aren't directly part of the fish's immediate habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, detailed drawing of a fish in a river habitat. The fish is shown with a smooth, streamlined body, labeled parts including fins, tail, and gills. The river is depicted with flowing blue water, clearly labeled, surrounded by details such as green seaweed and gray rocks on the riverbed, each labeled. Other elements include a small fish and a snail labeled to show interactions. The fish is positioned near the plants, illustrating swimming and hiding behaviors. The drawing style is realistic yet simple, typical of a school science project, using bright and clear colors to differentiate parts.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes a clear, labeled drawing of the fish and its habitat, focusing on how the environment supports the fish's survival. The prompt deliberately highlights essential elements like water, plants, and other living creatures in the river. The student is capable of including these elements accurately, but areas like additional plant labeling acknowledgment reflect potential minor omissions. Atmospheric details are intentionally omitted as they are not essential to the task."
