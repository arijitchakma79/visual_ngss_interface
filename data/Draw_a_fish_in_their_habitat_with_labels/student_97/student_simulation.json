  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I’ll start with drawing the fish. I remember fishes are kind of oval or almond-shaped, so I’ll draw that with a tail on the end. Hmm, I know fishes have fins, so I’ll draw a couple of those sticking out from the body. Now, where do fishes live? Oh, right, in water! I’ll just draw a wavy line beneath the fish to show that it's in the water. I think that’s the habitat part. I’m not sure what else should be in the fish's habitat or what parts I need to label, so I’ll leave it like that since I don’t remember what they need to eat or anything like that.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, hand-drawn style scene showing a basic almond-shaped fish with fins and a tail. The fish is placed above a single wavy blue line that represents water. No other habitat elements or labels are in the scene. The colors should be simple, like a basic gray for the fish and light blue for the water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict only a basic understanding of a fish and its habitat. It captures drawing simple features, like the general shape and fins of a fish, and a minimalist representation of water. This aligns with the student's inability to label the habitat or show interactions, thus no other elements or labels are included in the drawing."
