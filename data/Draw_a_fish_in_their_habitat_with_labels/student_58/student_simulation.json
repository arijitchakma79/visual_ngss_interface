  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the fish. I know fish have a simple shape, like an oval with a tail, so I'll draw that and label it as 'fish'. Next, I need to show where the fish lives. Fish live in water, so I'll draw a large circle around the fish and label it as 'lake'. I remember that lakes have plants, so I’ll draw something that looks like a plant and label it 'seaweed'. I want to show more wildlife, so I'll draw a simple bird above the water and label it 'duck'. I'm not sure how exactly to show how these things work together, like how the fish needs the lake or the sunlight for the plants, so I won't focus on that. My drawing might not have everything the habitat needs, but it does show a fish, water, and some other living things.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple child-like drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish is an oval shape with a tail, colored blue, with a label 'fish'. It's inside a big circle labeled 'lake', which represents the water. Include a simple green plant labeled 'seaweed' near the fish. Above the lake, draw a basic bird shape labeled 'duck', colored brown. The drawing should be in crayon style, colorful but minimal, representing basic elements of a fish's habitat without complex interactions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a simple drawing of a fish, a basic habitat labeled as a 'lake', and an attempt to include another organism like 'seaweed' or a 'duck'. The student struggles with showing detailed interactions or systems, which is why the drawing lacks elements like sunlight or detailed resource use. This reflects their developing understanding and keeps the elements separate without showing relationships."
