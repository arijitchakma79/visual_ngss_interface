  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. Hmm, I know fish live in water, so I’ll start with a simple fish. I’ll draw an oval shape for the body and add a triangle for the tail, and maybe some small fins. I remember fish have eyes, so I’ll add a big round eye too. Now, they need to be in water, so I’ll draw some blue waves or a wavy line to show the water. I think fish also live near plants, maybe like seaweed. So, I’ll draw some long, green lines that go up and down for plants. I’ll write 'fish' next to my fish drawing. I remember seeing other fish in the water too, so I'll try to draw a smaller fish with the same oval shape and little triangle tail. I'll label that one as 'small fish'. I'll label the green lines as 'plants'. Hmm, I think the fish need water to survive, so I'll write 'water' somewhere above the waves. I'm not sure what else the fish need in their habitat or how the plants help them, so I'll keep it like this.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The picture includes a simple oval-shaped fish with a triangle tail, drawn in bright colors, and labeled 'fish'. It is placed in a wavy blue water body to indicate the ocean. There are tall, green wavy lines labeled 'plants' and a smaller fish drawn similarly labeled 'small fish'. The style is basic, colorful and simplistic, with labels for some elements but missing details on habitat connections.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s understanding of a fish in water with some labeled elements, like a second fish and plants. However, it does not have detailed connections between the fish and its habitat resources, and it lacks information on specific survival needs like food, aligning with the student's current learning level."
