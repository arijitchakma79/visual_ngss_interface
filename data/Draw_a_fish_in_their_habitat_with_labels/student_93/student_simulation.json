  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I remember what a fish looks like, kind of like a sausage with a pointy end. I'll try to draw the body first. I think fish have fins, but I'm not really sure where they go, so I'll just put one on the side. Now for where it lives. I know they need water, but I'll just draw some waves underneath it to make it look like it's in water. I'm not sure what else belongs in the picture. Maybe a tree or some grass, because I've seen those in pictures. For labels, I remember we have to label parts, but I'm not sure what to call them. I'll write 'fish' next to the body and maybe 'water' near the waves, because that's what makes sense. I don't remember what fish eat or need, so I guess that's okay.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene where there is a vaguely fish-shaped figure, resembling a sausage with a pointy end and one fin on the side. Place the fish figure above wavy lines meant to represent water, but the fish appears to be floating above it rather than in it. Include a tree on the side, unclear if it's underwater or not. Add labels like 'fish' pointing to the fish figure and 'water' near the wavy lines. Use a combination of crayons and colored pencils to create a colorful but abstract drawing suited for a beginner's level.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures the student's ability to represent something that resembles a fish, though without detail or accuracy. The fish is not placed correctly in an aquatic environment, and the student inaccurately includes a tree, which doesn't belong underwater. The presence of 'fish' and 'water' labels shows simple labeling with basic identification, not matching parts of the fish or its needs from the habitat, in line with the level of understanding."
