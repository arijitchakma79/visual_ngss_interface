  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the fish. I know I can draw a pretty good fish and remember to label its parts like the fins, gills, and tail. Next, I’ll draw the habitat. Since I want to show an ocean, I’ll add waves at the top to represent the water surface. Below, I’ll draw some sand, rocks, and a few types of plants. I think seaweed is cool, so I’ll draw lots of it, but I’m not sure of all the plant names, so I’ll just label it generally as 'aquatic plants.' I’ll add some bubbles and maybe a few small fish or crabs because they often live in the ocean too. I’ll label these other animals and plants in the habitat. I remember showing how the fish interacts with its environment, so I’ll draw it swimming around some bubbles to indicate it’s breathing. I’m going to put some random clumps labeled 'rocks' but might not label each individual element like every single plant because I think people will know what those are.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an ocean scene with a detailed fish swimming among aquatic plants, labeled fins, gills, and tail. Include a sandy ocean floor with rocks and seaweed labeled as 'aquatic plants'. Add bubbles to show the fish interacting with its environment. Draw small fish and crabs nearby, labeled as 'small fish' and 'crab'. The color should be naturalistic and vibrant, with detailed shading. The drawing style should be illustrative and educational with clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures the student's capability to accurately draw and label critical elements of a fish and its habitat, such as the fish's fins, gills, and tail, as well as elements like 'aquatic plants' and animal interactions. It aligns with the student's struggles, such as not knowing specific names of plants and occasionally skipping labels for obvious elements like individual rocks, as the student assumes the viewer will understand without explicit labeling."
