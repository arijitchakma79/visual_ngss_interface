  "Reasoning": "Okay, I have to draw a fish in its natural home. I'll start with the fish in the middle of the paper. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines around it to show it's in a pond or ocean. I'll make sure to label the fish and the water this time. Next, I’ll draw some water plants like seaweed next to the fish and label them. I think fish might use these plants for hiding or resting, but I'm not quite sure how to label that. I should also add a couple of other water animals, like a snail on a rock or a couple of small fish, to show that others live here too. I’ll label them. Maybe I'll draw bubbles to show there's air in the water. I know I sometimes forget to label things. Last time, I forgot to label the plants as something fish might use. I'll remember to title my picture as well.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple colored pencil drawing of a fish in its pond habitat. The central focus is a fish with big eyes, outlined in blue and yellow. Around the fish, draw light blue wavy lines to represent water, and label it 'water.' Add green, wavy lines for seaweed next to the fish, labeled 'seaweed'. Include a few small, differently colored fish swimming nearby, and add a grey snail on a rock. Label these animals as 'fish' and 'snail'. The style should be childlike and playful, with clear labels in block letters. Include a few small bubbles rising from the fish and title the drawing 'Fish in Pond Habitat'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes elements the student can successfully incorporate, like drawing and labeling the fish, water, and additional animals. The prompt also reflects potential struggles, such as not clearly indicating the complex use of resources, like how plants provide shelter. The drawing style and labels are designed to align with being proficient at a simple level, as described in the level profile."
