  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll draw a blue wavy line across the middle of the page to represent the water. Now, I'll sketch a fish, perhaps a goldfish, right in the center of the water. I remember that fish need water to live, so I'll label the water 'Water'. Around the fish, I'll draw some seaweed at the bottom and label it 'Aquatic Plants'. I'll add a couple of bubbles because fish need oxygen. I’ll write 'oxygen' next to the bubbles. Now, I’m going to add another fish or two to show the fish isn’t alone. I might struggle with remembering exactly how plants help the fish, like providing oxygen or shade. I remember fish need food but won't show how the plants or other elements work together to support the fish—I think just showing them is enough. I will also add a snail on a rock for company and label it. My drawing has most elements, but I need to think more about how everything fits together.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful underwater scene featuring a medium-sized goldfish in the middle of a blue body of water with wavy lines. Include labeled 'Water' across the top of the water line. Place green seaweed drawn in a simple style in the bottom corners, labeled 'Aquatic Plants'. Add two smaller fish nearby and a few bubbles above the goldfish, labeled 'oxygen'. Include a gray rock with a small snail on it, labeled 'snail'. Use broad, bold lines and bright colors typical of elementary school art.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to include a fish and its habitat and label key elements like water and oxygen. It also captures the addition of other organisms, such as a snail, showing a shared habitat. The struggle to fully integrate ecosystem relationships appears in the simple representation of interactions—missing out on detailed plant roles. The overall style and level of detail appropriately demonstrate the student's proficiency level. Elements like bubbles and aquatic plants are shown, but their roles are not deeply connected, aligning with the student's partial ecosystem understanding."
