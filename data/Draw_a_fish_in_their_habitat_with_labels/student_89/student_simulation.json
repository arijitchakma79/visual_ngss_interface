  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish and where it lives. First, I need to draw the fish. I remember that to make a fish, I can draw an oval shape, and then I’ll put a triangle at the end for the tail. Now, I'll try to draw some water. I think water looks like wavy lines, so I'll just make some of those around the fish. I know I'm supposed to label things, so let’s try it. I'll write 'fish' next to the oval. I think the water should have a label, too, but I'm not sure what to call it, so I'll just write 'grass' since that seems okay. Maybe I need to show other things like plants. I’ll draw some grass-like lines above the water. Oh wait, fish also need...what do they need? I'll write 'needs air' because I know everything needs air. I'm trying to think of how the fish and the water go together, but it's hard, so I'll just have the fish above the water a bit. I think that's it!",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing showing a simple oval shape with a triangle tail to represent a fish. Around the fish, there are wavy lines to suggest water. Above the water, some lines like grass are drawn to represent plants. Labels are added with 'fish' next to the oval and 'grass' next to the wavy lines. Another label says 'needs air' near the fish. The drawing uses bright colors and is in the style of a typical elementary school artwork with crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a basic shape for the fish and wavy lines for water. The labels are simplified and inaccurate, like calling water 'grass,' which aligns with the student’s inability to label correctly. There’s no interaction shown between the fish and the habitat, as the fish is above the water line, and the drawing doesn't represent system interactions, consistent with the student’s level of understanding."
