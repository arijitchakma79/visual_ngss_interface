  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish because that’s what the task is about. I know fish look kind of like an oval shape with a pointy tail, so I’ll draw that first. Now, I remember the fish lives in water, so I'm going to draw some wavy blue lines around the fish to show it’s in water. I’ll label the fish 'fish' and the water 'water' to make it clear. I think fish might have things like plants or rocks around them underwater, but I'm not positive about what each part does, so I’ll just draw a few small squiggly shapes and a lumpy shape. Those can be the plants and rocks. I’ll label one plant and another as a rock, but I’m not sure if I’m right. I know that fish eat something, but I’m not sure how to show their food or what fish food looks like in the water, so I think I'll skip that part. My drawing doesn’t really show how the fish uses the things in its habitat except for living in water, and I don’t really know how to show that they help the fish survive, so I think I’m done.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a fish set in a blue wavy water background, with the fish labeled 'fish' and water labeled 'water'. Include some small squiggly lines that are roughly plant-shaped and a lumpy form for a rock, labeling one as 'plant' and another as 'rock'. Use basic colors like blue for water and simple green for plants. The drawing style should be childlike, with thick lines and a simple, uncomplicated layout.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including the basic elements they can identify: a fish in water, labeled correctly. It also reflects their struggles and misunderstandings, like mislabeling or incorrectly rendering habitat elements (plants, rocks), and omitting more complex interactions and dependencies, such as food sources, which they didn’t include."
