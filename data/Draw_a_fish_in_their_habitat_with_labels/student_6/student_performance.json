  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully show or label the connection between the fish and its need for water to survive (e.g., the label might just say 'water' without further explanation).",
    "The student might miss labeling other elements of the habitat that are beneficial to the fish, such as plants or rocks, or mislabel them (e.g., calling a plant a 'rock').",
    "The student might struggle to demonstrate how the habitat provides the fish with essentials like clean water and food, missing or muddling this connection (e.g., not drawing any food sources).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate how the fish and its habitat function systematically to meet the fish's needs (e.g., lack of any elements showing a cycle or interdependence)."
