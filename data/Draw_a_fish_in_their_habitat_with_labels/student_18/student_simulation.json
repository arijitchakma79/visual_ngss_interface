  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish. I know that fish live in water, so I'll start by drawing a big wavy blue line at the top to show water. I'll draw a fish with a big oval body and a tail. I remember my teacher saying fish have fins, so I'll add two fins, but I'm not sure exactly where they go. I’ll label the fish by writing 'fish' next to it. Now, I need to show the habitat. I’ll draw some green wiggly lines on the bottom to be plants. I know plants are underwater too, so I’ll label them 'plants.' I think fish might eat bugs, but I'm not sure how to draw them, so I'll just leave that out. The fish needs to move, but I don't know how to show that with the water or fins. Hmm, maybe I'll try to draw another animal too, like a small worm, and write 'worm' beside it, but I'm not sure if it lives here. I'm not sure how the plants help the fish, but they’re part of the habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A simple hand-drawn scene featuring a fish in its habitat. The fish is a basic outline with an oval body and a triangular tail, drawn in a light gray pencil. Two basic fins are included, though not anatomically correct, colored light gray. The fish is labeled with the word 'fish' in a child's handwriting. The water is depicted above the fish with a single wavy blue line to indicate the surface. At the bottom, there are wiggly green lines representing plants, labeled 'plants.' One poorly defined worm-like creature can be seen slightly outlined near the plants, labeled 'worm.' The drawing is simple with minimal details, reflecting the understanding of an early elementary student.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures what the student can do: draw and label basic elements like a fish and water in its habitat. The student includes plants and an attempt at another animal in the ecosystem with simple labels. However, the drawing also reflects the student's struggles; there are no movement indicators like waves or correctly placed fins, and there's no clear relationship shown between the fish and other ecological elements like food. The style is simple and unrefined, consistent with a developing understanding typical of a Level 2 student."
