  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll start by drawing a big fish because I know fish are the main part of the picture. I'll give it scales and fins, and don't forget its tail. I'll label it 'fish.' Now, the fish needs a place to live, so I'll draw some water around it. I think a lake has good wavy lines like this, and I know that's important for a fish. I'll label the water 'lake.' Next, I'll draw a big plant, which might look like a tall grass or seaweed, and I'll label it 'plant.' The bubbles should come from the fish's mouth to show it needs air; I'll label those 'air bubbles.' I remember fish also swim around in groups, so I will add a small fish next to the big one. I can draw rocks at the bottom, but I might forget what they do, so I'll just skip labeling them. Finally, I'll add a turtle and some reeds around the water to show other living things, but I'm not sure if they belong in a lake or ocean. I'll label the turtle.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an underwater scene with a large fish at the center, showcasing detailed scales, fins, and a tail. The fish is surrounded by wavy blue water, labeled as 'lake.' Include a smaller fish nearby. Add tall aquatic plants rising from the lake bed, labeled 'plant.' Bubbles come from the fish's mouth, labeled 'air bubbles.' Feature additional elements like a turtle and rocks, but without specific labels. Use bright colors and a child-like drawing style, with clear but simplistic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's skills by ensuring a focus on the fish and its essential habitat elements like water and air bubbles. It shows their ability to include and label primary features like plants but acknowledges their tendency to omit or mislabel less obvious elements like rocks. The student draws additional animals and plants, which illustrates interaction but might confuse habitat specifics like lake versus ocean."
