  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big fish in the center of my paper. I remember I need to label it as a 'Fish' so everyone knows it's the animal I'm focusing on. I'll give the fish bright colors like blue and orange stripes because I think those colors are popular in fish. Next, I'll draw the habitat. Since fish live in water, I'll draw water all around the fish and write 'Water' above it. I'll add some seaweed and label it as 'Plants'. I really like drawing plants that sway in the water. I will add a few other fish and a crab to show more life in the habitat but might forget to label them. Lastly, I'll try to draw the ocean floor with a bit of sand. I remember that fish eat something like little bugs or smaller fish, but I'm unsure what exactly, so I will skip labeling any food sources. I think this shows how the fish lives, but I’m not sure how the plants and fish interact, so I’ll just leave them separate.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of an underwater scene with a large, colorful fish in the center labeled 'Fish'. Surrounding the fish, there is a blue watery background and green seaweed labeled 'Plants'. The ocean floor is depicted with a light brown sandy bottom. A few smaller fish and a crab are present but not labeled. The drawing style is vibrant and simple, with clear outlines and basic colors, reflecting a young student's level of detail and understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes an accurately drawn fish and labels essential parts of the habitat, like water and plants. The student correctly depicts living components of the habitat but lacks consistent labels for all living things due to a typical challenge at their proficiency level. The drawing does not illustrate specific fish survival needs, like food, or show detailed interactions between the fish and other habitat elements, aligning with what the student cannot do."
