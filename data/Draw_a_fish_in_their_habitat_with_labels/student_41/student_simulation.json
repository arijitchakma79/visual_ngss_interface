  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish. I know fish swim in water, so I’ll use blue for that. First, I’ll make an outline of a fish. I think fish look like an oval or a pointy end, so I’ll try that shape. I'll color it orange because fish are orange, right? Next, I need to label my fish. I'll write 'fish' next to it. Oops, I spelled it 'fihs.' Now for the water, I’ll just color a big area around the fish with blue. I think fish live in water, so that should work. I'm not sure what else needs to be in the picture or what fish eat, so I won’t add anything else. I’ll just label the water with 'ocean' even though it doesn’t look like a real place with other things in it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an image of an orange fish with a simple, basic shape, possibly a rough oval with a pointy end, in the middle of a blue area representing water. The fish should be labeled 'fihs' with the word floating nearby. The blue area, intended as water, lacks details of a habitat, with no other plants or animals drawn. Include a label 'ocean' next to the blue water. Use cartoonish and uncomplicated style with bright, simple colors to reflect an elementary level of drawing.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's beginning understanding of the task. It includes an attempt at drawing and labeling a fish, albeit with misspelling. The water is simplistically depicted as a blue area but not as a detailed habitat, meeting the CAN description. The absence of other correctly labeled plants or animals, and lack of depiction of resources like food for the fish, aligns with the CANNOT features of the student's level."
