  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish today! Let's see... I think fish have a long body and they have fins. I’ll start with a simple long shape with a pointy head and a curvy tail. I think it should also have two fins on the sides. Now, where do fish live? Umm, in water! I’ll draw some wavy lines under the fish because that looks like water, right? I know fish live with other things like seaweed or other fish, but I'm not sure what else to add or how to show other animals. Okay, now for the labels… I’ll just write 'Fish' above my drawing. Oh, maybe the water too, let me see… I think I'll just leave that without a label. I’m not sure how to draw the place where fish live, like an ocean or a lake, so I'll just leave the background blank. I hope this looks good!",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a simple fish with a generic outline set against a background with wavy lines to represent water. The fish is plain with minimal features, showing a basic fish shape with a pointed head, a curvy tail, and two fins on the sides. The only label is 'Fish' written above it. The background is mostly empty with no specific environment, just a few wavy blue lines to suggest water. The drawing is colorful but simple, with crayons or colored pencils art style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by describing a generic fish shape with minimal detailed features and attempts to indicate water using wavy lines. It also reflects what the student struggles with and misunderstands by omitting accurate labels for the habitat and additional living or non-living features. This aligns with their inability to illustrate a functional or explicit environment for the fish or represent its interaction with necessary resources."
