  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the outline of a fish in the middle of my paper. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines around it to show that it's in its natural water habitat. Now, I need to label the fish, so I'll write 'Fish' next to it. I know fish need water to live, so I'll write 'Water' near the wavy lines. I think fish also might have things like seaweed around them, so I'll draw a couple of green seaweed plants and label them. Maybe there are smaller fish or insects too. I'll draw a small fish nearby and try to label it, even if I'm not sure exactly what type it is. Fish need food, so I'll add a few small bits that look like algae or insects near the larger fish and label them as 'Food'. I'll draw an arrow from the fish to the water because that's where it swims, but Iâ€™m not totally sure how to show all its needs. I'm not sure about all the food chains or how to show that plants give oxygen, so I won't include those.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, naive drawing of a fish in its water habitat done with crayons. The fish is centrally placed with simple details and labeled 'Fish'. Surrounding the fish, there are blue wavy lines labeled 'Water'. On either side, a couple of green seaweed plants are partially labeled 'Seaweed'. Nearby, a smaller, simplistic fish is drawn and labeled 'Small Fish'. Near the mouth of the main fish, there are bits labeled 'Food' resembling algae or small insects. An arrow is drawn from the fish to the water, depicting swimming but with no complex interactions like food chains.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt matches the student's abilities by including basic elements of a fish's habitat such as water, a fish, and some simple aquatic organisms like seaweed and its food, all of which are labeled correctly. The drawing style is simple and colorful, showing effort typical of proficiency at this level. The lack of complex ecological interactions, like detailed food chains or species-specific interactions, aligns with the student's limitations in understanding and illustrating those concepts."
