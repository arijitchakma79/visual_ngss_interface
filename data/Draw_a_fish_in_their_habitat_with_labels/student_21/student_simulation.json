  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I think a fish looks like a long oval, so I'll make that shape. I won’t add any fins or the tail because I’m not really sure where they go or what they’re called. Now, I’ll add some water around it since I know fish live in water. I’ll draw some wavy lines around my fish to show the water. I haven’t learned much about what else is in a fish’s habitat, so I won’t add any plants, rocks, or other animals like turtles or birds, since I’m not sure what would be there or what they’re called. I won’t worry about air or how the fish swims because I don’t have to add those details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple sketch of a fish as a plain oval shape without fins in the center of the page. Surround the fish with simple, wavy blue lines to indicate water. Use basic colors like blue for water and gray for the fish. There's no other detail in the water, like plants, rocks, or other animals. The drawing should look like a simple, child's drawing with minimal detail and basic colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'can' and 'cannot' do because it includes a basic fish shape with water represented generally, aligning with the student's ability to draw a simple fish and recognize water as the habitat. It avoids labeling specific parts, omitting other organisms and interactions, reflecting the student's lack of understanding and detail."
