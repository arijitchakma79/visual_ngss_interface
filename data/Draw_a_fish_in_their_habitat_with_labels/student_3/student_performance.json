  "Topic": "Draw a fish in their habitat with labels.",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a fish accurately in a natural water habitat, such as a lake, river, pond, or ocean, with some environmental features like water, plants, or rocks.",
    "The student can clearly label the fish and include a few other animals or plants found in the same habitat (e.g., labeling a 'fish' and a 'plant').",
    "The student can show and label some resources this fish needs to survive, such as water and general food sources (e.g., 'water' and 'food' labels near suitable items).",
    "The student can suggest how some elements of the habitat work together to support the fish (e.g., water currents helping fish move)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not fully represent how all elements of the habitat interact as a cohesive system (e.g., missing connections between plants providing oxygen for the fish).",
    "The student may inconsistently label or show how the fish depends on specific parts of its environment (e.g., missing details in showing how plants provide food)."
