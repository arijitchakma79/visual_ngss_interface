  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a wide blue area to represent the ocean, since I want to show a diverse marine habitat. I need to draw a fish first. I remember to keep it detailed, so I’ll add fins and scales, and label it clearly. Next, I’ll draw some seaweed and label that. I'll include other animals too, like a crab and maybe a dolphin swimming. I should label these as well. I think it’s important to show how these animals use resources, so I’ll draw the fish swimming in the water and the crab near some rocks for shelter, both labeled. I know I need to have the ocean labeled clearly, so I’ll write 'ocean' above my drawing. I need to include the resources fish need to survive, like water, plants, and rocks. I remember that I'm supposed to show interaction, so I’ll draw some bubbles to show the oxygen the plants give off, but I’m not sure how to label what each plant does for the environment specifically beyond ‘plants’. I’ll add some light lines to show sunlight coming into the water and perhaps label 'sunlight' as well. I shouldn't worry if I forget to label small rocks unless they are important, since that’s not really the main focus.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of an ocean habitat. In the center, there is a detailed fish with scales and fins, clearly labeled 'fish'. Surrounding it, green seaweed labeled 'seaweed', a crab labeled 'crab' near brown rocks, and a dolphin labeled 'dolphin'. The background shows a blue ocean with light blue bubbles and lines indicating sunlight labeled 'sunlight'. At the top, the word 'ocean' is written clearly. The fish swims through water labeled 'water', and the resources in the habitat, like water, plants, and rocks, are labeled. Drawing style is colorful and childlike with an emphasis on clear labeling.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities, as they include a variety of plants and animals, clearly label the fish and other creatures, and label the habitat as 'ocean'. They represent interaction and resources necessary for survival within an understandable system, showing effort in creating a cohesive depiction. The prompt respects the areas the student might struggle with, such as not detailing the specific oxygen contribution of the seaweed or labeling all minor elements such as small rocks, which aligns with the CAN and CANNOT specifications."
