  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw a fish and its habitat. I'll start by drawing the fish. I know a fish has a body, fins, a tail, and eyes. I'll make sure to label each part. Now, I'll draw the habitat. I remember fish live in water, so I'll draw water around the fish. It could be a pond, lake, river, or ocean, but I'll choose a lake because it’s familiar. I'll add some plants in the water, like seaweed, and maybe another fish too. I’ll label these elements to show how they are part of the fish's environment. Next, I’ll draw some rocks on the bottom of the lake for detail. I remember reading that plants and water are resources that fish need, so I'll label those too. I won't forget to label the body of water as ‘lake’. I know fish need water to survive, so I’ll write that near my drawing. I won’t include a specific type of fish, just a general one and, oh, I might forget to draw another animal, like a predator, interacting with the fish. I’ll make sure everything is colorful, using greens for plants and blue for water, making my drawing bright and lively.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, detailed drawing of a fish in a lake habitat. The fish, with its body, fins, tail, and eyes clearly labeled, swims in a blue lake. Various shades of green seaweed and other aquatic plants grow in the water, labeled as well. Another fish swims nearby, and rocks rest on the lake bed. The entire scene is vividly colored, with each element detailed and labeled. The water environment and its importance for fish survival are clearly noted, but there are no interactions shown with predators or specific fish species labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all the elements the student is capable of drawing as per their skill level, such as the fish parts and habitat being accurately drawn and labeled. The student also includes other living things and natural resources necessary for the fish's survival. However, the student refrains from labeling a specific type of fish and does not show or label interactions like predator-prey relationships, aligning with their limitations."
