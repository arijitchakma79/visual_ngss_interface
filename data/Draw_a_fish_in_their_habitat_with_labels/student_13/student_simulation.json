  "Reasoning": "I have to draw a fish in its habitat. Fish live in water, right? So first, I'll try to draw a fish. I remember fish are kind of long and have a tail, so I'll make an oval shape with a triangle for the tail. It looks like a fish, I think. I'll label it. What do I know about fish? Maybe I can just write 'fish' on it. Now, what's next? They live in water, but I'm not sure how to draw water... Maybe I'll just color around the fish with some blue. I'm missing something. Oh, the habitat! I think trees are in nature, so maybe I can draw a tree next to it. There aren't any living things that go with fish, like cows or something, right? Ok, my fish is labeled and I have some blue for water. Hopefully, that's right!",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish is a simple oval shape with a triangle as a tail, filled in with a solid color, possibly gray or orange. The word 'fish' is written next to it in big, clumsy handwriting. The water is represented by light blue scribbles around the fish but not distinct. To the side, there is an oversized, basic tree drawn in green and brown without details. The style is naive and reminiscent of a beginner's drawing, with thick lines and unsteady hand, typical of a student's work at an early level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents the student's capability to draw a simple shape that might resemble a fish and label it with a generic term, like 'fish'. The student struggles with depicting the water environment correctly, deciding to use indistinct scribbles instead. They misunderstand the concept of habitat, incorporating unrelated elements like a tree, and are unable to show or articulate the interdependence of life and resources within the habitat."
