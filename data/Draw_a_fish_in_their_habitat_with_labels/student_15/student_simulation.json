  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big fish in the middle of the paper because the fish is the main focus of the habitat. I'll give it fins and a tail and label the parts like 'fin,' 'tail,' and 'gills.' Next, I'll draw some water lines around the fish so it looks like it's swimming. Then, I'll add some plants, like seaweed, because I remember that fish often live near plants underwater. I’ll label the seaweed. Now I’ll add a few more creatures, like a smaller fish or a snail, and label them too. They usually live in the same place as bigger fish. I’ll draw a sun in the corner because sunlight is important for plants and label it. Although I understand most things, I’m not sure how to show the fish needing the plants or how all the things in the picture work together. I should include rocks at the bottom, but I'm not sure what role they play, so I will just label them as 'rocks.'",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its aquatic habitat. The fish is large, taking up most of the center. It has clearly labeled parts such as 'fin,' 'tail,' and 'gills'. The fish is drawn in shades of blue and green to fit the water theme. Around the fish, there are simple, wavy blue lines indicating water. To one side, there are green seaweed plants, also labeled. There are also a smaller fish and a snail, each labeled. At the top corner, there's a bright yellow sun, labeled 'sun'. The bottom has some round gray rocks with a label. The style is simple, using bold colors and clear labels but lacking detailed interconnections between elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the fish and its key features, which the student can draw and label correctly. It also includes other details like plants and animals, showing proficiency. However, it does not show complex relationships or interactions between these elements, reflecting the student's difficulty in showing interdependencies and broader system connections."
