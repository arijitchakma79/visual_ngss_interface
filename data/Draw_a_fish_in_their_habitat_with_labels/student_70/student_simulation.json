  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish because I know that's the main part of the drawing. I'll make it swim in the water because fish live in water. I remember my teacher saying that. I'll draw some plants around the fish. I've seen plants in the aquarium, so I know they belong in the water too. After drawing the fish and plants, I'll add labels. I'll write 'fish' next to the fish and 'water' above it so it's clear. I'll write 'plants' next to the plants. I’m not sure how to show that the fish needs the plants or sunlight. I think as long as I have a fish and some plants with labels, it's okay.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful scene with a yellow fish swimming in a blue water background. Include green plants around the fish. Label the fish with the word 'fish' in large, clear letters. Label the water with 'water' at the top. Label the plants with 'plants' next to them. Use a straightforward, child-like drawing style with thick outlines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by focusing on basic elements: a fish, water, and plants with clear labels. It avoids complex relationships, such as the fish's reliance on plants, aligning with the student's struggle to capture systemic interactions. The prompt reflects a developing level by incorporating effort and accuracy in basic representations without deeper connections."
