  "Reasoning": "To start, I'll draw a fish in the center of my paper. I remember the key parts that need to be labeled: the fins, gills, and scales. I’ll use a bright color to make the fish stand out, like maybe a blue or green. Next, I’ll move on to the habitat. Since the fish is in water, I'll draw waves or a water pattern around it, with some bubbles to show it is swimming. Let's make it an ocean scene. I'll add different plants, like seagrass and maybe some colorful corals on the bottom. I need to label these plants and show how they are important for the fish. I'll also add a few other animals, like a small crab on the seabed and another fish swimming nearby. I'll label them too, making sure to show they are part of this ecosystem. I’ll write down labels for 'water' and 'food', perhaps next to a small school of fish that the bigger fish might eat. Oops, sometimes I make a small spelling mistake in labels or forget a minor one, but I'll make sure the main parts are covered. Now, I'll add arrows or lines to show how things are connected, ensuring I show the dependencies, even if they're a little simplified. I’ll use a lot of color and try to make everything clear and accurate.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration featuring a detailed underwater scene. A central fish, drawn with vibrant colors like blue or green, is labeled with 'fins', 'gills', and 'scales'. Surrounding it is an ocean habitat with wavy lines and bubbles indicating water. The seabed includes labeled seagrass and coral, drawn in vivid greens and reds. Nearby, a small crab and another fish are present, both labeled. Arrows indicate connections between organisms, showing interdependence. Labels for 'water' and 'food' are near a school of fish. The drawing is colorful and detailed, with a few minor misspellings but no significant omissions in the labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by focusing on an accurate and detailed representation of a fish and its habitat, with clearly labeled parts and showing ecosystem interactions. While the student is capable of producing a mostly correct and colorful drawing, the prompt allows for minor inaccuracies, such as small spelling mistakes, without impacting the overall comprehension and advanced level representation expected of the student."
