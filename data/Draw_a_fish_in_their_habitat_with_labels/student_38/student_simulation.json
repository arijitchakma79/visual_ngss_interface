  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a fish in its habitat and label it. First, I'll draw the fish; I know fish have a basic shape like an oval with a tail. I'll sketch that out and label it 'Fish' because that's the animal living in the water. Next, I'll draw the water around the fish. I'll just make a straight line above and below the fish and label it 'Water.' Now, for the habitat, I remember that fish live near rocks or plants, so I'll draw a small rock on the bottom and a single plant next to it, like a tall line with a few leaves. I should label them 'Rock' and 'Plant.' Hmm, I remember that fish need clean water and maybe some shelter, but I'm not sure how to show that, so I'll skip it. Now I need to make sure I label everything. I labeled the fish, water, rock, and plant. I think that's it. Hopefully, it looks enough like a habitat for the fish.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a basic fish in an underwater habitat. The fish is a simple oval shape with a tail and is labeled 'Fish.' The habitat consists of water, represented by two straight lines above and below the fish, labeled 'Water.' A small rock and a tall plant with a few leaves are depicted at the bottom, labeled 'Rock' and 'Plant.' The drawing is in a colored pencil style with basic colors: blue for the water, gray for the rock, green for the plant, and a simple color for the fish like orange or yellow. The labels are written in a child's handwriting, straightforward and sometimes a bit uneven.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw a basic fish shape and label it, indicating it lives in water. It includes the attempt to add simple habitat features like a rock and a single plant, both labeled, showcasing the student's emerging understanding. However, the prompt does not describe complex features, varied water details, or the connection of resources to the fish's needs, aligning with the areas the student struggles with. The drawing shows minimal habitat features as predicted in the student profile."
