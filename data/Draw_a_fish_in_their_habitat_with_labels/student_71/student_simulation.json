  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a big fish, like a trout, in the middle of the paper. I know that fish live in water, so I’ll make sure to draw a lot of blue water around the fish. I remember that fish often share their habitat with other animals, so I’ll draw a couple of more fish, maybe a small orange one like a goldfish. Next, I’ll add some green plants in the water because I know plants are important for fish. I need to label everything, so I’ll label the big fish ‘Trout’ and the small orange one ‘Goldfish.’ I'll also write ‘Water’ next to the blue water and ‘Plant’ beside the green plants. Let me add a bit of the sandy bottom so that it looks more like a place where fish live; it can have some stones or shells. Hmm, I might forget to label how fish are swimming in the water, just that water is there. I’ll finish by drawing a light blue sky above the water, with a cloud to show how water and weather are connected, but I might forget to say exactly why the cloud matters for the fish.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful and child-like drawing of a fish habitat. The main feature is a large trout in the center, drawn in realistic colors. The habitat includes a blue watery environment with several smaller fish, including a bright orange goldfish. Green aquatic plants are scattered throughout the water. Labels are present: 'Trout', 'Goldfish', 'Water', 'Plant'. The scene includes a sandy bottom with stones and shells, as well as a light blue sky with a cloud. The drawing is simple and clear, with some elements missing labels for complete contextual interactions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes and labels different types of fish, their watery habitat, and essential survival elements like water and plants. It also reflects their minor gaps, as elements like interactions between the cloud and fish are hinted at but not fully labeled. The style reflects the effort of a proficient level student who may overlook small labeling details, such as not labeling the interaction between water and fish, consistent with the 'CANNOT' attributes."
