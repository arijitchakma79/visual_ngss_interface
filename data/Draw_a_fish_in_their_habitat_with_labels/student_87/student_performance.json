  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label specific places like lakes or rivers, occasionally omitting them entirely (e.g., may label it vaguely as 'body of water').",
    "The student might not fully illustrate or label the relationships between the fish, its environment, and other components; minor elements may be missing or unlabeled (e.g., the relationship between fish and aquatic plants).",
    "The student might not consistently demonstrate how the water habitat provides resources beyond basic needs like water and food (e.g., shelter might be overlooked or implied but not labeled).",
    "The student may fail to fully integrate or label the system showing how the components work together, leading to some parts being only partially connected or illustrated."
