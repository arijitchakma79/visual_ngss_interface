  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll draw a fish that looks like a blue tang because I remember they live in the ocean. I'll make sure to label the fish clearly so anyone looking knows it's a fish. Now, I need to show that the fish is in water, so I’ll draw wavy lines around the fish and color it light blue to represent the water. I remember fish need food, so I'll draw some small seaweed and label it as 'food' for the fish. Next, I'm going to draw some plants, because I remember that there are plants in the water too. I'll add a green seaweed plant but I might just label this as 'plant' because I’m not sure of specific names like 'kelp'. I'll add a shell on the seafloor to show there's more to this place than plants and water. I think the fish lives in a body of water, like a lake or river, but I’ll just label it vaguely as 'body of water'. I should show the fish swimming by drawing some water currents around it. I know water is important, so I label the water too. I'm not sure if I need to connect everything, but I think my fish looks like it’s living in its habitat now.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, child-like drawing of a blue tang fish swimming in water, with light blue wavy lines indicating water. The fish is labeled 'Fish'. Around the fish, draw a green seaweed plant labeled 'Plant' and a smaller seaweed labeled 'Food'. The water is labeled 'Water'. Include a generic shell on the seafloor. The habitat is labeled generally as 'Body of Water'. Use vibrant shades for all elements in a sketch-like style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because the student draws and labels a fish and its basic needs like food and water accurately and clearly, which aligns with what they can do. The student includes other plants and animals but does not fully label or connect all elements, reflecting their struggles. They also label the habitat generically as 'body of water' rather than specifying a particular ecosystem, illustrating the aspects they might overlook or struggle with."
