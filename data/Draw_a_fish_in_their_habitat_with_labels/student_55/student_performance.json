    "The student can include and label some other living things, such as aquatic plants or a few other fish, portraying the habitat's biodiversity.",
    "The student can show and label additional resources like rocks and plants, though some may only be partly labeled or missing labels.",

    "The student might inconsistently label all elements, sometimes forgetting to label certain parts like rocks or plants (incomplete labeling).",
