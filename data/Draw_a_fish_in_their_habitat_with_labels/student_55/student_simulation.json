  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a fish. I remember that fish have scales, fins, and a tail, so I'll make sure to include those. The habitat is water, so I'll draw my fish in a blue water background. I know water is important for fish, so I'll label the water as 'Water - Vital for Fish's Survival.' I'm supposed to draw other things that live in this habitat too, like plants. I’ll add some green wavy lines for aquatic plants and label them 'Plants.' I think fish may also live with other fish, so I'll draw a small school of fish nearby, labeling them as 'Other Fish.' I remember something about rocks in water; they’re important too, so I’ll put a few gray, oval-shaped rocks on the bottom but might forget to label all of them. I’ll draw lines to show water currents around my fish to mean it uses the water to breathe with gills, but it might look just like wavy lines. These elements all live together in the water but sometimes I forget how they all affect each other, so I might not show all connections clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its natural habitat. The fish is in a blue underwater background, with visible scales, fins, and a tail. It's labeled 'Fish'. The water is labeled 'Water - Vital for Fish's Survival'. Green, wavy aquatic plants are labeled 'Plants'. A small school of fish nearby is labeled 'Other Fish'. Gray oval-shaped rocks at the bottom may have one or two labels but are mostly unlabeled. Simple, wavy lines are drawn around the fish to represent water currents. The style is simple, colorful, and indicative of elementary school art, showing a sincere yet basic understanding of a water habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to correctly depict and label a fish in a water habitat, showing some biodiversity with plants and other fish. The prompt reflects an understanding of water as a critical resource for fish, though the system's complexity and connections among all elements are only partially illustrated. Some elements, like rocks, are present but not fully labeled, reflecting the student's noted challenges."
