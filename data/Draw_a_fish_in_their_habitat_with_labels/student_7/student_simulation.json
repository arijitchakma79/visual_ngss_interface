  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the fish, because I remember it needs to have some specific parts. I draw the body first, then I add fins at the sides, a tail at the back, and gills near its head, and I label them carefully. Now I need to draw the water; I’ll make some wavy lines around the fish to show it's in the water and label it 'water.' I know fish need food, so I’ll draw some small insects or maybe another smaller fish and label them as food. Hmm, I’m less sure about what other parts there are, like plants. I’ll try drawing some plants and label a couple, but I might miss some details. I also can’t always tell how everything in the environment helps the fish, so I won't capture those subtler details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful underwater scene with a fish in the center. The fish should have clearly drawn and labeled parts: fins, tail, and gills. Surround the fish with wavy lines labeled 'water' to depict its habitat. Include simple drawings of small insects or a smaller fish labeled as 'food.' Add a few surrounding plants, some labeled and some not. Use a child-like drawing style with bright colors and thick outlines, reflecting a student's effort to represent their understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately depict and label the fish's parts and some elements of its environment, like water and food sources. It also shows where the student struggles, such as inconsistently labeling plant elements and not fully illustrating environmental interactions, aligning with their proficient performance level."
