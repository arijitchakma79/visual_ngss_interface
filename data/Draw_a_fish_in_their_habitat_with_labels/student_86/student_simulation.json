  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a fish in its habitat, so I’ll start by drawing a fish. I remember that a fish is kind of oval-shaped, so I’ll try drawing that. I'll add a simple tail and maybe some fins. I can label it 'fish'. Now, the fish needs to be in water because that's where fish live. I’ll draw a big wavy line at the bottom of the page and below it, I’ll label this whole area as 'water'. I think I should add something else to show it’s a fish's habitat, so I’ll put a big rock next to the fish and label it 'rock'. I could add a plant too, like a big stalk, and I'll label it 'plant'. I'm not sure what else to put because I know fish live in water but I don’t know if it’s a pond or an ocean, so I'll just leave it as 'water'. I’m not sure where food would go, and I want to make sure the fish looks cool, so I'm going to draw some bubbles around its mouth because I’ve seen that in pictures.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish is oval-shaped with a small tail and fins, labeled 'fish'. It's situated in an area labeled 'water', which occupies the bottom half of the image with a wavy line separating the water from the air. Include a large rock and a tall plant next to the fish, both labeled 'rock' and 'plant' respectively. Draw simple bubbles around the fish's mouth. Use bright colors like blue for the water, gray for the rock, and green for the plant. The drawing style should reflect a beginner's level with basic shapes and labels.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's ability to draw a simple fish with basic labels, showing their understanding of essential habitat elements like water, a rock, and a plant. It reflects their struggle with labeling specific types of water or understanding the ecosystem's complexity, such as food sources or interconnected elements. The overall style matches a developing student's drawing capability with simple shapes and use of broad, basic terms for labeling."
