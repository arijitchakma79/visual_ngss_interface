  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish first. I remember it has to be in the water. So, I’ll make a big oval shape with a tail at the end; that’s the fish. I’ll label it 'fish' so it’s clear. Now for the water, I’ll draw some wavy lines below the fish and write 'water' nearby. I think fish eat worms, so I’ll draw a small squiggly line in the water near the fish and call it ‘food’. I’m not sure about adding more things like where it gets oxygen, or how plants help—it’s a bit confusing for me, so I’ll leave that out. I remember fish need water, so I’ve got that part right, I hope.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple child-like illustration of a single, oval-shaped fish labeled 'fish'. The fish is positioned above some wavy blue lines labeled 'water', indicating its habitat. Next to the fish, include a small squiggly line labeled 'food', representing a worm. Use bright colors and a crayon drawing style to reflect a developing understanding at an elementary level. Leave out any complex relationships like oxygen or plant life involvement around the fish.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label a basic fish and its habitat water. It includes a simple representation of food near the fish, which aligns with their understanding. The student struggles to label or illustrate more complex environmental relations like oxygen exchange or plant life contributions, hence these elements are omitted from the drawing."
