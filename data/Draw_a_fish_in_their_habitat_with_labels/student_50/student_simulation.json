  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish because I know that's what I need to do. I remember that fish live in water, like a pond or the ocean, so I'll draw some water around it. The fish will be a simple shape, kind of oval with a tail, and I'll give it a dot for an eye. I think fish have scales, but I’m not sure how to show that very well, so I might leave it plain. Now, I'll label the water since I remember that's important. I'll write 'Water' next to it. I know fish need other things in the water, like plants or rocks, but I’m not sure how to show those or why they matter, so I won't include them. I’ll just draw something simple and label the water to show where the fish is living. I'll also leave out other animals or birds because I’m not sure what to do with them or how they would be important to my fish.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple fish in a water environment. The fish should have an oval body with a tail and a dot for an eye. The water should be labeled with the word 'Water'. The scene should only include the fish and the water, with no plants, other animals, or additional features. The drawing style is basic and colorful, suitable for a student developing an understanding of ecosystems.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes a simple fish and water, which the student can draw and label. The omission of plants, animals, or interactions reflects the student's lack of understanding about how ecosystems work. The drawing style and content are meant to showcase the student's emerging understanding by focusing on basic elements and labels."
