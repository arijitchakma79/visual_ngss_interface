  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing a big fish in the middle of my paper. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll surround it with blue waves and label it as 'ocean.' I also need to think about what other things live in the ocean with fish, so I'll draw some seaweed and smaller fish around. I'll label the seaweed 'seaweed' and the smaller fish as 'prey,' because fish need something to eat. I remember that the fish also need water to survive, so I'll add some arrows pointing to the fish from the ocean and label them 'water' to show this. I want to make sure everything is correct, but I'm not sure about the exact type of plants or if I've got the fish's scales right. For my fish, I'll add a couple of greenish and yellowish lines to show the scales, even if I don't remember the exact pattern. I think that's all the important parts: the fish, the ocean, some seaweed, and smaller fish. I'll color the fish in bright colors to make it stand out like I remember seeing in books, maybe with some orange and yellow.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful scene of a fish in an ocean habitat. In the center, there is a large fish with orange and yellow colors, surrounded by blue water waves labeled as 'ocean.' Include some green seaweed and smaller fish around it, each labeled as 'seaweed' and 'prey.' Use arrows labeled 'water' pointing to the fish to show its reliance on the ocean water. The illustration should include a mix of colors: blue for the water, green for the seaweed, and orange and yellow for the fish. Draw in a simple, child-like art style with visible labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately depict a fish in its water habitat and label both the environment and the fish's resources like water and prey. It also includes an attempt to add detail with seaweed, though the exact type might not be named. The colors and labels demonstrate an effort to meet the advanced task level, even though some details like specific scale patterns may not be precise, capturing possible areas of minor oversight as described."
