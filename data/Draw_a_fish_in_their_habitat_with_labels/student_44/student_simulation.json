  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll start by choosing a scene that a fish would live in. I’ll draw a pond because it has interesting elements. I'll sketch out the pond shape first. Next, I'll draw a fish swimming in the pond and label it 'fish.' Now, I think about what else is in a pond: aquatic plants, insects, maybe some rocks. I'll draw some tall, wavy plants like reeds and algae underwater and label each type of plant. I'll remember to show the fish interacting with the plants, maybe by drawing it near the plants it might eat. I also need to show the environment, so I'll draw water ripples and maybe some bubbles. I'll label the pond's 'water' to show it's part of the habitat. I'll add other animals, like a frog on a lily pad and label them. Now, let's show what fish need to survive; I'll draw an arrow from the water to the fish to indicate it needs water to swim. I might forget to label one of the smaller plants, and it’s okay if I draw birds or clouds above without labeling them since they’re not part of the main focus.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of a pond habitat with a fish. The scene includes aquatic plants like reeds and algae, with a frog on a lily pad. The fish is swimming among the plants, labeled as 'fish.' The water is clearly depicted with ripples and bubbles, labeled 'water.' Arrows show interactions: one from the water to the fish, indicating it needs water. The style is colorful and realistic, with attention to detail. The background includes some unlabeled clouds and birds.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to create an accurate, detailed depiction with labels showing the fish and its dependencies, aligned with what they can do for their level. They show a system where fish and environment interact. Minor omissions such as not labeling every plant or adding extra, unlabeled details are consistent with described limitations."
