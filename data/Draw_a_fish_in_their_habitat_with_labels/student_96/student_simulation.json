  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish because that’s the main part of this task. I remember that fish have fins and scales, and I want to make sure I draw those details accurately. I’ll draw the fish in the water, which is the habitat it needs to survive. I’ll label the parts of the fish like the fins and scales, and I’ll also label the water. Next, I’ll think about what else lives in or around the water habitat. I remember that fish eat smaller fish or plants, so I’ll add some smaller fish and label them. Also, I'll draw some plants like reeds, which can provide shelter for the fish. Reeds are those tall grass-like plants that grow near water. I’ll label them too. I'll also add some rocks and maybe a frog or a duck at the edge of the water to show other parts of the habitat. I know the relationship between the fish and its environment is important, like how the plants and rocks help provide food and shelter. For the labels, I need to be careful with spelling. Sometimes, I might misspell a word, but I'll try to check my work. The overall picture should show how this habitat supports the fish and other living things.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed, colorful drawing of a fish in its water habitat. The fish is centrally located in clear blue water showing visible fins and scales. It is labeled 'fish', with labels for fins and scales. Around the fish, draw and label smaller fish and green reeds that provide shelter. At the edge of the water, add plants like cattails and rocks labeled accordingly. Include a frog and a duck near the water's edge, both labeled. The drawing is styled with careful attention to detail, using colored pencils to give a realistic and advanced-level appearance, but includes a few minor misspellings in the labels.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt focuses on the student's strengths, such as accurately drawing and labeling the fish with realistic details and including other habitat elements like smaller fish, reeds, and rocks. It also includes a variety of living organisms in and around the habitat, showing the student’s understanding of the ecosystem. Minor misspellings in labels align with the possible small errors the student might make, reflecting the advanced level but acknowledging potential minor oversights."
