  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a fish because that's the main focus. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll place it in a big blue body of water, maybe an ocean. I'll draw a large fish with fins and scales, and then I'll label it as 'Fish.' Now I need to include some other parts of its habitat. I know fish live around plants, so I'll draw some green seaweed next to the fish, and I'll label that 'Seaweed.' I think seaweed grows in water, so this shows it's part of the habitat too. I should draw another animal in the water to show they share the habitat, so I’ll add a small crab at the bottom, labeled 'Crab,' to show other animals live here. I know water is important, so I'll label the water 'Ocean.' Oh, and maybe a dolphin swimming nearby, labeled 'Dolphin.' I remember fish need air but I'm not sure if I should label that, so I'll skip it for now. I can’t remember all the interactions between the fish and the plants or other animals, but I know they all live together.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing showing a fish in a vibrant blue ocean habitat. The fish is large with visible scales and fins, labeled 'Fish.' Next to it, green seaweed is labeled 'Seaweed.' At the bottom, a small orange crab labeled 'Crab' indicates other sea animals. A dolphin labeled 'Dolphin' swims nearby. The blue water is labeled 'Ocean.' The drawing style is colorful, with bold lines and simple labels. The art is expressive and lively, depicting a simplified ocean ecosystem.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because they successfully place and label a fish, showing its water habitat, and include some interactive elements like seaweed and other animals labeled, which indicates partial ecosystem understanding. However, the student does not label all necessary resources such as air and does not capture complete ecosystem interactions, aligning with their struggles and misunderstanding limits."
