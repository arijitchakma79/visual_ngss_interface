  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish first because that’s what I remember! Fish are usually long, so I’ll make a long shape. I remember they have fins, so I’ll add some fins and a tail. I think fish have eyes, so I'll draw a little circle for an eye. Hmm... fish live in the water, but I’m not sure how to show the water. I won’t draw any because I’m not sure how to make it look like there’s water. I know fish sometimes swim with other fish, but I’ll just draw one because I don’t remember what else should be in the picture. Maybe fish eat plants, but I don’t really know what they look like underwater, so I’ll skip that. I heard about sunlight, but I’m not sure if it matters here. I guess that’s it! I’m not sure what else to add or label, so I’ll just leave it like that.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing of a single fish with a long shape, fins, a tail, and an eye, floating on a blank background. The fish is colorful, maybe with a mix of bright reds and blues. There are no additional elements like water, plants, or other animals. The drawing style is basic and simplistic, typical of beginner-level sketches. No labels are present on the drawing. The scene lacks contextual background to indicate an aquatic environment.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's ability to include a fish in their drawing visually, but there's no depiction of its habitat, like water, or any environmental elements. The colorful fish aligns with their basic understanding of a fish's appearance, yet the lack of surroundings reflects the struggle to illustrate the habitat and interactions within it. The absence of labels matches their difficulty in connecting the environment's resources, like water or sunlight, to the fish’s needs."
