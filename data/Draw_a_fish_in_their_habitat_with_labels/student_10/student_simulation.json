  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. First, I'll draw a simple fish shape with a body, tail, and some fins. I'll label the whole thing as 'fish'. Next, I'll draw some wavy lines around the fish to show water because I remember fish live in water. I'll label one of the wavy lines 'water'. Now the habitat should have more things, so I'll try drawing some plants because I think other living things are in the water too. I'll put a few plants at the bottom of my drawing. Wait, I think there needs to be more, but I'm not sure what else fish need... like food or... oh, I just can't remember. I'll just make sure everything is labeled clearly so Ms. Smith can see what I've done. Let's add labels to my plants, but I'll just write 'plants' since I'm not sure what specific plants these are.",
  "Prompt": "A simple crayon drawing showing a fish labeled 'fish' in a blue wavy-lined area labeled 'water'. The fish is basic with a pointed shape, fins, and a tail. At the bottom are green, sponge-like shapes labeled 'plants'. The drawing has a basic, child-like style with colors primarily in blue and green.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a simple fish and labeling it, as well as adding wavy lines to represent water with a label. The student also includes plants in the environment. It does not include specific interactions between elements or detailed ecosystem roles, aligning with the student's limitations. The style and labels reflect the student's developing understanding and emerging skills."
