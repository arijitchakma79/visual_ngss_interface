  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I remember fish have a body shape like an oval, so I'll draw that. Next, I'll add a tail and some fins. I know that fish live in water, so I’ll draw a big blue area for the water around the fish. To show some plants, I’ll add a few straight green lines next to the fish, which I think are like seaweed. Let me label the fish, because I know the fish is important. I might add a rock because I remember rocks sometimes are underwater, so I draw a lumpy shape nearby. But I'll just guess they are rocks without labeling them because I'm not sure what else to call them. Finally, I’ll add bubbles next to the fish because I think fish make bubbles.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish has an oval body with a tail fin and side fins, and it is labeled as 'fish'. It is in a large, blue scribbled area representing water. On one side, there are simple green lines resembling seaweed or plants. Near the bottom, there is a lumpy shape intended to be a rock, not labeled. The drawing includes a few bubbles drawn near the fish. The style is naive and childlike, with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw a basic outline of a fish and attempt to show water as part of the habitat. It also reflects their effort to include resources like rocks and plants, though not accurately labeled or connected to the environment. This matches the student's developing level, showing some understanding but with noticeable gaps in interactions between elements."
