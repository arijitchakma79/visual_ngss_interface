  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing a fish because that's the main part of my task. I remember fish live in water, so I'll draw some water around the fish. I should label the water because I know it's important for the fish to live. Now, I think there might be other things in the water, like another fish or maybe some plants. I'll draw a few plants because I know that water isn't just empty. I should label them, but I'm not sure what all of them do or if they are necessary for the fish to live. I'll just try my best. I know fish breathe underwater, but I'm not sure if they need the plants for that. I'll focus on making sure I label the water for sure. Maybe I should draw a rock, but I'm not sure how important it is to the fish. I'll add it anyway, but I don't think it needs a label.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a fish underwater, with a few plants and another fish nearby. The water is labeled clearly. The plants and other fish are drawn simply and without any labels. A rock is drawn in the scene but it seems less important. The drawing is colorful, using blues for the water and greens for the plants, with simple lines and a cartoonish style that matches a young student's level of detail.",
  "Explaination": "This drawing shows the student's level of understanding as they include a fish, water, and some elements of the habitat. The labeled water demonstrates what they can do clearly. The inclusion of plants and another fish shows an emerging understanding of a habitat but with unclear labeling due to the student's struggles. No clear representation of how the elements interact is included, matching the student's current developmental level."
