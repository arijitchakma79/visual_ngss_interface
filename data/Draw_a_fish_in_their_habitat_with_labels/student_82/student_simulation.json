  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I think a fish looks kind of oval, so I'll make an oval shape. I remember fish have a tail, so I'll add a triangle at the back for the tail. I’ll draw a line for the mouth, and maybe two lines for the fins on the side. Now, I'll label it 'fish' next to it because I know how to label this. I'm going to draw some wavy lines at the top of the paper; that looks like water to me. Since a fish needs plants, I’ll draw a simple plant too. Maybe just a tall line with a couple of leaves. I’ll add another fish next to the first one to show they’re both in the water. I can also put a rock at the bottom, just a big oval. I don’t really know what else to label or how to show why the fish needs the water. I’ll just leave it at that and not label the water or anything else since I'm not sure about it.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing depicting an underwater scene with a simple blue wavy line at the top to represent water. In the center, there are two crudely drawn fish, each an oval shape with triangle tails and two lines for fins. One fish is labeled 'fish' in basic handwriting. Below, there's a tall line with two oval leaves to suggest a plant, and a large oval shape at the bottom resembles a rock. The drawing is made with thick black outlines and filled with basic colors: blue for water, gray for the rock, green for the plant, and a mix of orange and yellow for the fish. The drawing lacks intricate details and labels, reflecting a simplistic and developing understanding of a fish habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as they can draw basic shapes like an oval for the fish and can label 'fish', but the labeling stops there, reflecting their emerging understanding of the topic. They include minimal habitat elements like a plant and another fish but leave out complex connections or detailed habitat interactions, aligning with the student's struggle to label the water and misunderstandings of habitat roles."
