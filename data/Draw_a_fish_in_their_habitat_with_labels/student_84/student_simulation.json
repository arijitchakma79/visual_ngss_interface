  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the shape of a fish, making sure to include its fins, tail, and eyes. I'll label each part. Then, I'll draw the water around the fish because that's where it lives. I remember that fish need plants, so I'll add some aquatic plants and label them, like 'kelp' or a simpler 'seaweed'. I'll also add another fish to show there's more than one animal in this habitat. For food, fish like to eat algae and plankton, so I'll add some greenish blobs for algae and smaller spots to represent plankton and label them. I know plants provide oxygen to the fish, so I'll draw lines from the plants to the water, labeling them as 'oxygen'. I might forget to label very small things, like individual bubbles, or narrow down specific algae types, but I'll focus on the main things that show how everything is connected in the fish's habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of an underwater scene featuring a fish with clear labels for its parts like fins, tail, and eyes. The fish swims in a blue aquatic environment surrounded by green aquatic plants labeled as seaweed. Another fish is visible in the background. Small green blobs are placed around to indicate algae, with tiny spots representing plankton as food, all labeled accordingly. Flow lines from the plants to suggest oxygen production are included and labeled. The drawing is in a realistic, detailed colored pencil style, reflecting an advanced understanding of the habitat as a system without including every specific detail.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by emphasizing the fish's parts and the overall habitat system, such as fish needing plants for oxygen. It captures the student's ability to depict main features and relationships in the habitat. The student's potential oversight in labeling small elements like bubbles or including every possible plant or animal is accounted for by focusing on key components of the ecosystem."
