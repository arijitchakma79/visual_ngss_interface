  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I'll start by drawing a fish. I think it looks like a long oval shape with a tail at the end. I'm not sure exactly how a fish's fins look, but I'll just add some triangles on the sides. Now, I need to draw where the fish lives. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines above the fish to show it’s in a lake or ocean. I'm not sure what else goes in a fish habitat, so I’ll leave it mostly empty. I should label the water. I'll write 'Lake' above the water lines. Hmm, I don’t really know any specific names for the fish or the plants, so I'll skip adding those labels. I don’t really know what else to draw for the fish’s habitat, so I’ll stop here.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, beginner drawing of a fish with minimal details in a child's drawing style. The fish is an oval shape with a triangle tail, with some triangles as fins on its body. It is placed in the center of the drawing. Above the fish, there are wavy blue lines to represent water. The word 'Lake' is written in simple, child-like handwriting above the wavy lines. The background and rest of the habitat are largely empty and uncolored.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's attempt to draw a fish in its habitat by focusing on what they can do, such as drawing a basic fish shape and identifying water as part of the habitat with a label like 'Lake.' However, it lacks details, such as other animals or plants in the habitat, and does not illustrate the interactions and relationships within the habitat system, consistent with what the student cannot do."
