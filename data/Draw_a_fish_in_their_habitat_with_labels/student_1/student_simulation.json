  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I know fish live in water, so I'll start by drawing a big blue background to show water. I'm drawing the fish now â€“ I think it looks like an oval, so I'll do an oval shape and add a triangle at the back for a tail. Fish have lines on them, maybe that's for detail, so I'll draw a few lines across the fish. I know I should label things, but I'm not sure what to write. I think I'll label the water, maybe call it 'skies' as that's what comes to mind first. I don't really know what else to add around the fish, so I'll leave it like that. I'm trying to make the fish look like it's in the water by drawing some light blue wavy lines around it, but it's hard to make them look clear or like they're part of the habitat. I don't think about adding plants or other animals because I'm not sure what should be there.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The background is a solid blue color to represent water, though it's unclear if it's for water. The fish is a simple oval shape with a triangle tail, and a few lines are drawn on its body for detail. There are light blue wavy lines around the fish, attempting to show water but not distinctly. There is an incorrect label 'skies' pointing to the water. The drawing lacks other elements of the habitat and has no interaction or relationship elements. The style is naive and simplistic with pencil and crayon colorings.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a basic shape of a fish and attempt to depict water without a clear understanding of the habitat's purpose or elements. The label is incorrect, illustrating a misunderstanding, and there's a lack of other habitat elements or interaction demonstrations because the student does not recognize these aspects."
