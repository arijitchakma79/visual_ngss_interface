  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to label parts of the habitat accurately, such as plants or water, or might omit labels entirely (student doesnâ€™t know what to include).",
    "The student is unable to correctly draw and label other living things within the habitat (student does not understand what else belongs in the fish's environment beyond the fish itself).",
    "The student cannot illustrate the relationships or interactions, like a fish swimming in water, as distinct and purposeful parts of the habitat (student doesn't recognize the interconnectedness).",
    "The student does not demonstrate an understanding of how the habitat supports the fish's life or depict this functioning as a system (student lacks awareness of survival needs).",
    "Labels may be incorrect or missing, and the student may incorrectly label unrelated features as part of the habitat (e.g., labeling water as 'skies')."
