  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. I know fish live in water, so I'll start by drawing the big wavy shape to be the lake. It’s like where the fish swim. Now, I'll draw the fish. I'll make it a big oval with a tail because that’s how I remember fish look. I’ll add an eye and a line for the mouth. For labels, I’ll write 'fish' next to the fish. I know fish need water, so I’ll label the wavy shape 'water'. Fish don’t live by themselves, so let me add another fish beside the first one. Now, I’ll draw something that looks like a plant, just some wavy lines at the bottom, but I’m not sure what type of plant it is, so I’ll leave it without a label. I think I'm done because I don't really know what else to add for the fish to eat or exactly what kind of plants should be here. I’ll just add one fish and not more because I don’t know how they all fit together. I hope I remembered all the important parts!",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a simple fish in a basic lake habitat. The environment features a large, wavy blue water shape representing a lake. Two simple fish, drawn with oval bodies and triangle tails, swim in the water. The fish are labeled 'fish'. The water is labeled 'water'. At the bottom, there are few wavy lines representing plants, but they are unlabeled. Additional details are minimal, capturing a child's developing understanding with basic elements and labels. The drawing is colorful and simplistic, with bold outlines and primary colors, reflecting a young student's style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student is able to do at their developmental level. They can draw a simplified fish and water environment, correctly label the fish and water, and add basic elements like another fish and a vague plant. However, it avoids illustrating or labeling specific resources like food or detailed plant types, which they cannot identify or understand fully. The prompt specifically omits any complex interaction depictions or comprehensive labeling of all habitat elements, matching the student's limited ability to label accurately or recognize intricate ecological needs."
