  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the outline of a fish in the middle of my paper. I remember that fish have gills, fins, and scales, so I'll add those details: two fins on the side, a dorsal fin on top, and vertical lines to represent scales. I'll label these parts so they're clear. Now, I'll draw the fish's habitat. Since fish live in water, I'll start with a horizontal line for the water surface and some wavy lines to show it's underwater. Next, I think about what the fish needs to survive. Clean water is obviously important, so I'll label that. I'll draw some algae or underwater plants for the fish to eat and hide amongst and label them as well. To show more of the fish's habitat, I'll add rocks for the fish to explore and a small area of shading by drawing overhanging branches from the water's surface. Next, I’ll add other living organisms around the fish. I'll draw a smaller fish swimming nearby and some aquatic plants. Maybe an insect or two, like a water bug, on the water surface. I'll label all these parts because they're part of the fish’s ecosystem. I've read fish are part of a system, so I'll write a note explaining how the fish might eat the plants or be food for larger animals. However, I'm not so sure about how the fish fits into the bigger food chain or how water temperature affects it. Also, I tend to forget about the bottom substrate, even though it’s important.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed underwater scene showing a fish in its natural freshwater habitat. The fish is centered with clearly labeled gills, fins, and scales. Surrounding the fish are underwater plants like algae and rocks labeled as food and shelter. The water surface is depicted with wavy lines, with overhanging branches casting a shaded area. Include smaller fish swimming nearby and show insects on the water surface. Label all elements clearly. The drawing should be colorful, with vibrant greens for plants, blues for water, and earthy tones for rocks. The style should reflect a fourth grader's detailed pencil and colored pencil drawing, emphasizing clarity and accuracy.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s ability to draw and label the fish accurately, along with its immediate habitat elements like water, plants, smaller fish, and insects. The inclusion of vibrant colors and labels captures the student’s competence at an advanced level. However, the prompt does not overly detail the ecological roles, such as broader food chain dynamics or water temperature influence, aligning with the student’s identified areas of struggle."
