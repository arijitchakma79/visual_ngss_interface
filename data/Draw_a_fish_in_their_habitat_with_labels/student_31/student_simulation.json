  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the fish. I know it's important to show the main parts like the fins, tail, and body. I'll make sure to label these parts clearly. Next, I'll draw the habitat. Since fish live in water, I'll show the fish in a body of water, maybe an ocean. I will label the water because I know fish need water to survive. I'll add some seaweed or a plant because fish share their habitat with plants. I don’t remember exactly how the plants help the fish beyond being there, but they are part of the habitat. I'll also add a few rocks at the bottom. Let me label the rocks too. I know there are other fish in the ocean, so I'll draw another fish nearby, but I won’t show them interacting. I won't focus too much on detailed interactions or the food chain since I’m not quite sure how to depict that.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of a fish in an ocean setting. The fish should be clearly labeled with parts like fins, tail, and body. Show the fish in blue ocean water, also labeled. Include green seaweed or plants nearby, labeled as well, and a few gray rocks at the ocean floor. Add another fish nearby, but don't depict interaction between them. Use a simple, child-like drawing style with clear labels for each part.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately draw and label the main parts of a fish and indicate its habitat as water. The inclusion of plants and rocks aligns with the student's ability to label living and non-living things in the habitat. The student focuses more on illustrating the fish than systemic interactions, which is why they add another fish but do not show interaction. This aligns with their proficiency level in showing clear elements but not complex interactions."
