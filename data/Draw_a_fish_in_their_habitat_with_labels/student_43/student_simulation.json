  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I know fish have a long body, fins, and a tail, so I’ll make sure my fish looks like that. I’ll draw a big oval shape for the body and add a triangle for the tail. I remember that fish have gills and eyes, so I’ll add those too. I think I’ll call this fish a goldfish because it’s easy to recognize. Next, I’ll draw the water, where the fish lives. I’ll draw wavy lines above and below the fish to show it’s in water and write 'water' next to it. I should remember to add things that my fish needs to survive. Fish need water to live, so I’ve already got that. They also need plants for oxygen, so I’ll draw some green, wavy plants and label them 'plants.' Now, I want to think about what else lives in the water. Frogs live in water too, so I’ll draw and label a frog near the fish. Finally, I know the drawing should show how my fish and the frog use the resources. I’ll draw the fish swimming and add sunlight for the plants. I should use arrows to show sunlight helps the plants, but I sometimes forget to draw them, and I might label sunlight but miss mentioning algae or something else important.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful, child-like illustration of a fish and a frog in a water habitat. The fish is a recognizable goldfish with an oval body, fins, and a tail. Include wavy lines to represent the water, with the word 'water' labeled. Add wavy green plants labeled 'plants'. Also, draw a frog nearby. Include sunlight in the scene, depicting how it shines down, but without any arrows. The style is simple, using bright crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a recognizable fish, labeling the fish and plants, and drawing another creature like a frog. The student can also show sunlight but might struggle to use arrows to illustrate sunlight helping the plants or to label additional needs, leading to missing or incomplete labels for concepts like algae or direct sunlight use by plants."
