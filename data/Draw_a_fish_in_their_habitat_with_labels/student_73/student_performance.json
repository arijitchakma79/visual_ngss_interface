    "Label the water environment accurately as a specific type like a lake, river, pond, or ocean (student leaves the area unlabeled or writes a letter without meaning).",
    "Accurately represent or label resources the fish needs, such as water or living things (student might draw something unrelated, like clouds or a tree, thinking it contributes to the fish's survival).",
    "Show or label other plants or animals correctly that might be in the same habitat as the fish (student might add unrelated things like a car or a house).",
    "Draw arrows or indicators to demonstrate relationships between the fish, its habitat, and the resources it uses (student includes random lines or no arrows at all).",
