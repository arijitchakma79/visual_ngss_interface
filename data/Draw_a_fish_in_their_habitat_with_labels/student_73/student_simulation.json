  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a fish in its habitat. I know what a fish looks like, kind of like an oval shape. I'll start with that, a big oval on my paper. Fish have fins, so I'll put a couple of lines sticking out from the sides and one on top. It might not look exactly like a fin, but that's okay. Fish live in water, right? I'll draw a big blue patch around my fish to show the water. I'm not sure if it's a river or ocean, so I’ll just leave it blue. To make it look nice, I'll add other stuff. Maybe some clouds because clouds make everything look friendlier, and a tree, because there are trees near water sometimes. I'll try to label the water, but I’ll just put an 'L' for lake, I think. Hope that looks good!",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simplified fish in a basic habitat setting. The fish is a plain oval shape with a few simple lines for fins. Surround this fish with a large blue patch representing water without specific labels. Nearby, include unrelated elements like clouds and a tree. Use child-like, simplistic lines and basic colors to reflect the early stage of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's level as it describes an overly simplistic fish and water representation, aligned with the 'can' descriptions of drawing basic shapes without intricate details. Their misunderstanding is evident through the inclusion of irrelevant items like clouds and a tree in the habitat, shown in the 'cannot' aspect where student adds unrelated elements."
