  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. I'll start with drawing a fish in the middle of the page. I remember that fish have a body shape that's kind of oval or long, and they usually have a tail. I’ll add a tail, but I'm not sure whether to draw the fins very detailed. I'll give it a dorsal fin and a couple of side fins. Oh, and don't forget the eye! Now I'll label it 'Fish'. Next, I think it should be in water, so I'll draw wavy lines around it for the water in a lake. Now, I need to show where the fish gets what it needs to live. I'll draw an arrow pointing towards the fish and label it 'Water for swimming and breathing'. There should be other animals or plants too. I'll draw some tall grass-like plants and label them 'Aquatic plants'. Maybe I'll add a smaller fish and a snail; I’ll label these too. Okay, now I need to show how they interact. I’ll put the smaller fish near a plant and draw an arrow to show it's near food, but I’m not sure how to show everything is connected. I didn’t label every plant detail because I’m not sure what to call them. I think the picture shows the habitat but maybe doesn't explain every little thing like how plants make oxygen.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of a fish in a lake. The fish is a simple shape with an oval body, a tail, and two side fins, labeled 'Fish'. Surrounding the fish are wavy blue lines indicating water. There is an arrow labeled 'Water for swimming and breathing'. Nearby, there are simple drawings of aquatic plants labeled 'Aquatic plants', a smaller fish labeled 'Small fish', and a snail. A few arrows indicate interactions, such as the small fish near plants labeled as food. The drawing is colorful, using blues, greens, and browns, with a simple, child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency by including a recognizable fish and labeling it correctly as part of the habitat. The arrows and labels show where the fish gets resources, like water, as well as a few other habitat inhabitants such as plants and a smaller fish. However, the student struggles with more complex ecosystem interactions and leaves some details, like specific plant names or detailed anatomical features of the fish, less developed, consistent with their current understanding level."
