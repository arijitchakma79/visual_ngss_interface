  "Reasoning": "I remember I'm supposed to draw a fish in its habitat. I think a fish has a long body, so I'll draw a long oval shape first. I'm not sure what the fins or gills look like, but I'll add some lines on the sides just in case. Now, fish live in water, so I'll color the area around my fish with blue. I don't really know about where else they might live, but I know water is usually blue. I think that’s enough. I’m not sure what else to include, and I feel like a river might be a fish tank, so I'll just leave it. I don't remember much about plants or other animals, so I'm not going to add them. I know the sun is important, but I feel confused about where it should go, so I’ll just skip it.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a fish in its habitat. The fish is a simple oval shape with a few lines on the side to represent fins, lacking detail like scales or gills. The fish is placed inside a large blue area to suggest water, but there are no other components to indicate a specific habitat like a river or ocean. The background is mostly empty, and there are no plants, other animals, or sunlight included. The style is naive and childlike, with simple lines and basic colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents the student's ability to attempt a simple fish shape and represent water with a blue area, corresponding to the CAN statements. It also reflects the student's misunderstandings and omissions from the CANNOT statements, such as the lack of specific habitat details, other plants or animals, interaction elements like plants for food, and an understanding of water and sunlight's roles in the habitat."
