  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a fish. I know it should have a long oval shape for the body and maybe a triangle for the tail. I’ll make sure it’s in the water, so I’ll draw some wavy lines around it for water. I can label the fish with the word ‘Fish’. I need to show that it’s in a habitat, so I’ll put a line at the top to be the surface of the water. I think fish need plants, so I’ll draw something that looks like a plant with a straight stem and some zigzag leaves. I need to label it, so I’ll write ‘Plant’. I’m not sure if fish eat plants, but I’ll just label it anyway. I don't know what else fish need, so I think that’s okay. Maybe I'll add something like rocks for the ground, and I'll write ‘Rocks’ there. I won't label anything as food since I’m not sure. I remember fish need water, so I’ll label that. I’ll use a blue color for the water, a gray for the rocks, green for the plant, and maybe a simple line for the fish's body. I won't add other animals because I'm not sure which ones belong here.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple fish in an underwater scene. The fish is an oval with a triangle tail, colored in one solid color. It is surrounded by wavy blue lines representing water. One part of the water surface is shown at the top. There is a green simple plant with a straight stem and zigzag leaves nearby, labeled 'Plant', and some gray rocks at the bottom labeled 'Rocks'. The fish is labeled 'Fish', and the water is labeled 'Water'. Draw in a child-like, naive drawing style using bold and basic colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's understanding of the basic elements they can depict, such as labeling the fish and showing some parts of the habitat like water and a plant. Mistakes such as incorrectly labeling or omitting interconnected elements like food or other animals are present. The style and detail capture the developing level of understanding, showing isolated components without depicting complex interactions."
