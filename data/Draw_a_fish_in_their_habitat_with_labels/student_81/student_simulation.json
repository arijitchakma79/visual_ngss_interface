  "Reasoning": "I remember the task is to draw a fish in their habitat. First, I'll draw the fish. I know fish have a pointy front and a tail, so I'll start with an oval shape and add a triangle for the tail. That's my fish! Now I need to think about where fish live. Water! I'll add some squiggly lines around my fish to make it look like waves in water. This looks like a fish swimming. I remember something about fish habitats, like oceans or rivers, but I can't remember what they look like, so I'll just show wavy water. I need to label things, I think. This is a fish, so Iâ€™ll just write 'fish' near it. I'm not sure what else to label. There are things like food and other animals, but I'm not sure how to draw those or what they should be labeled. I'll put a boat at the top because boats are sometimes in water too, even though I'm not sure if that's right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like illustration of a fish with an oval body shape and a triangular tail, swimming in wavy water lines. The water is blue, and the fish is colored in with a plain color like orange or yellow. Add a rough drawing of a boat above the fish in brown. Label the fish as 'fish'. The image should have minimal detail and show a simplistic style with bold, unsteady lines as if drawn by a young child.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a basic fish shape and represent water with wavy lines but not accurately depict a specific habitat like a lake or ocean. The label 'fish' shows the minimal understanding with likely incorrect usage in more complex labels. Including a boat is an unrelated addition, indicating misunderstanding common at the student's level. This reflects beginning level elements correctly without advanced features they cannot do."
