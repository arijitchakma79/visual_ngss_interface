  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the fish swimming in its habitat. I'll make sure to include colors that represent a fish, like shades of gray or orange. I'll remember to label its parts like 'fins,' 'gills,' and 'tail.' Next, I'll draw water around the fish, adding air bubbles to show it needs oxygen. I'll label the 'water' to indicate where the fish swims. Then, Iâ€™ll add some plants. I know to include 'algae' as a food source and will label it. For additional details, I'll include a few 'lily pads' on the surface and attempt to draw rocks at the bottom. I might write 'plant' for the lily pads without specifying exactly, but I'll definitely get most of the labels right for key elements. I'll show how everything connects, adding arrows to represent the flow of resources, but I might not give names to all small fish or insects present. Finally, I'll draw a stream flowing into the lake, labeling it 'stream,' to show more aspects of the habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful underwater scene featuring a large, realistically-colored fish with labeled parts like fins, gills, and tail, swimming in clear blue water. Include and label floating air bubbles for oxygen. Add green algae labeled as food, lily pads on the surface (only labeled 'plant'), and rocks at the bottom. Ensure there are arrows indicating flow of oxygen and note the 'stream' flowing into the lake. Use a sketch style suitable for a detailed educational drawing, highlighting the relationship between the fish and its environment.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student's ability to accurately and confidently represent key components of a fish's habitat with well-placed labels on major elements. It also acknowledges their tendency to sometimes generalize or omit minor details by not specifying lily pad types or labeling smaller fish and insects, reflecting the student's ability and occasional oversight."
