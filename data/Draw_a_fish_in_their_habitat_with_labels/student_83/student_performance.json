    "The student might not clearly label all interactions between the fish and its environment (e.g., the role of plants in providing oxygen may be left unlabeled or vaguely labeled).",
    "The student might struggle to demonstrate a full understanding of the habitat as a system, possibly leaving out some interconnections between components, like how plants contribute to the fish's survival beyond being drawn in the background."
