  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the shape of a fish. I know a fish's body is kind of oval, with a pointy nose and a fan-shaped tail. I'll add some fins on the sides and top of the fish because those are important parts to have. I'll label these parts: 'Body', 'Tail', and 'Fins'. Next, I will draw the water around the fish because fish live in water. I'll make it look like an ocean since I think the ocean is really cool. I'll label this part 'Ocean'. Now, I need to add at least two resources the fish needs from its habitat. I remember that fish need water for swimming, so I'll label 'Water for swimming'. I'll draw some seaweed because it gives oxygen, labeling it as 'Seaweed'. For more details, I will add some rocks and maybe a few more plants in the background. I know that plants are important, but I won't write more about what they do because I'm not too sure about that part. I'll draw these plants and rocks without extra labels since I think theyâ€™re self-explanatory. I think I'm done, it looks pretty good to me.",
  "Prompt": "An illustration of a fish and its habitat drawn in a simple, childlike style with bright colors. The fish is prominently displayed in the center with clearly labeled parts: 'Body', 'Tail', and 'Fins'. The water is shown surrounding the fish, labeled 'Ocean'. Two resources are labeled: 'Water for swimming' next to the fish and 'Seaweed' nearby. In the habitat, include additional elements like rocks and a couple of undefined plants in the background, drawn without labels. The drawing lacks detailed interactions and complex connections among elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability of drawing and labeling the fish and crucial parts of its habitat, like water and seaweed, showing proficiency at their level. The student successfully includes rocks and plants but does not elaborate on their ecological roles, demonstrating the struggle with connecting how every component interacts with the fish's survival, as described in the 'CANNOT' section."
