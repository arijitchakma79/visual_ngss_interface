  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a fish in its habitat and label everything so that it's clear. First, I'll start by drawing a big fish in the middle of the paper. I'll make it look like a clownfish because they live in the ocean and are easy to draw. I'll use orange and white colors for the fish. Next, I'll label it as 'Clownfish'. I remember that clownfish live in anemones, so I’ll draw a big sea anemone next to it with wavy tentacles and label it 'Sea Anemone'. Now, I should add water, so I'll draw some blue wavy lines around to show that they are in the ocean - and label it 'Water'. The fish needs food, so I’ll draw some tiny fish around it and label them as 'Food'. I know fish sometimes eat algae too, so I'll sketch some green blobs on rocks and label one 'Algae'. For other animals, I'll add a small crab and a starfish, which also live in the ocean. I’ll label them 'Crab' and 'Starfish'. I’m trying to show how the fish interacts with its habitat, so I’ll draw the clownfish swimming around with some arrows to indicate that it's moving through the water and label the movement as 'Swimming'. I think I’m forgetting to show how everything connects, like the anemone providing shelter. I also thought about adding something about oxygen but I don't quite know how to show that properly.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a colorful underwater scene. In the center, there is a bright orange and white clownfish labeled 'Clownfish'. It is situated near a large, wavy-sea-anemone labeled 'Sea Anemone'. The background is filled with wavy blue lines labeled 'Water' to depict the ocean environment. Small fish are scattered around, labeled 'Food', and there are green blobs on rocks labeled 'Algae'. A small crab labeled 'Crab' and a starfish labeled 'Starfish' are placed nearby. Arrows around the clownfish demonstrate its movement, labeled 'Swimming'. The drawing uses basic colors and is created with a simple and childlike style.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt represents the student's strengths by featuring a correctly drawn and labeled fish with additional cohabiting organisms and elements like water and food sources. However, the student's struggles are evident as they do not show interconnectedness between habitat components, such as labeling the role of sea anemones as shelter or depicting oxygen-related interactions, which align with the things the student cannot do."
