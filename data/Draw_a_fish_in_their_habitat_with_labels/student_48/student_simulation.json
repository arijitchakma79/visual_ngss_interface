  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw a fish in its habitat with labels, and I need to be accurate and complete. First, I think about the fish. I'll draw a big fish with fins and scales so it's clear what kind of animal it is. I'll make sure it looks like it's swimming in water. Now, for the habitat, I want to show a pond because I know fish live there. I'll draw the water at the bottom and some plants like reeds and lily pads around the edges because these are common plants in ponds. I'll also add a couple of small swimming insects and maybe a frog by the water since they also live in pond habitats. Next, I'll label everything. I'll label the fish, the water, the pond, and some of the plants like 'lily pad' and 'reed'. I remember to label 'pond' clearly, so there's no confusion about the habitat. I need to make sure I include elements like air and resources. Iâ€™ll draw bubbles coming from the fish to show it needs oxygen, and I'll label them 'oxygen'. I remember fish need food, so I'll draw some little fish food like a bug or worm near the fish. I think I covered most things, but I might forget to label one of the plants correctly. Finally, I think of how the pond looks. I'll color the water blue and use green for the plants. I'll make the fish orange so it stands out, and the scene looks like a sunny day to show the habitat in natural light.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a pond habitat. At the center, there is a large orange fish with clearly defined scales and fins, swimming in blue water. There are bubbles labeled 'oxygen' coming from the fish's mouth. Around the edges of the pond, there are green reeds and lily pads. A frog is sitting on a lily pad and some small insects are drawn above the water. The scene is under a bright, sunny sky. The drawing is colorful, with blue water, green plants, and a bright orange fish, resembling a child's educational illustration style. Each element, like the fish, water, pond, reeds, and lily pads, is labeled. Some minor elements, like one of the plants, might be unlabeled, showing the student's occasional oversight.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately depict and label major elements of a fish in its habitat, such as a pond with water, plants, and other animals. The use of labels for major elements aligns with the student's ability to clearly identify parts of the habitat and resources. The intentional omission of a label for one plant reflects a minor oversight consistent with the student's described limitations. The drawing style is colorful and illustrative, matching the effort an 'Advanced' level student would make in creating a detailed educational scene."
