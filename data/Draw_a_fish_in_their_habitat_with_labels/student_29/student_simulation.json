  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish first because that's what I know I should do. I think a fish looks like a long oval, so I’ll start with that shape. I’ll add a triangle tail at the back because I remember they have tails. I know I should label it, so I’ll write 'fish' next to it. Now I need to draw where the fish lives. Fish live in water, so I’ll draw a big blue shape around my fish to make the water. I don’t remember needing to label the water, but I think it's enough to just draw it as blue. I don't know what else to draw in the water, like other things a fish needs or other animals, so I’ll just leave it with the fish alone. I know the task is mostly about the fish, so that should be okay.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful scene of a large, cartoonish fish in the middle of the page. The fish should be an oval shape with a triangle tail and an eye, drawn with bold, simple lines. Next to the fish, write the label 'fish' in simple letters. Surround the fish with a simple blue blob to represent water, but do not include any labels for the water or additional details like other animals, plants, or environmental elements. The drawing should look like it was done by a young child, using bright primary colors and a simplistic, playful style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by focusing on the representation of a fish with the label 'fish' and a simple blue blob as water. The style is simplistic and child-like, which aligns with their capability level. The lack of other labels or detailed elements such as additional animals or environmental interactions reflects the student's misunderstandings and what they cannot do. This approach demonstrates the student's minimal or no understanding of ecosystem interactions and the specificities of a fish's habitat."
