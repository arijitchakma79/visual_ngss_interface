    "- The student does not label the water environment specifically or understand the importance of labeling it (may not realize it's part of the task).",
    "- The student cannot identify and label resources the fish needs, such as water, air, or food (student may lack the concept of environmental resources).",
    "- The student may not show other living things in the water environment, or if drawn, they are not identified or labeled (may focus solely on the fish).",
    "- The student is unlikely to illustrate interactions between the fish and the environment, such as using arrows to show relationships (lacks understanding of interactions).",
    "- The student cannot represent or label a system of living things and their environment (too complex for the student level)."
