  "Reasoning": "I remember we have to draw a fish and where it lives. I think fish are long and have a pointy side, so I'll draw a shape like that. I'm not sure if fish have arms or legs, but I think they have something on top, so I'll draw a triangle on the top side to be safe. For the water, I remember seeing waves in a book, so I'll make a bumpy line, like waves, and put it around the fish. I think I should label things, but I'm a bit confused. I'll write 'fish' next to it. Maybe I'll label the wavy line too, or maybe label the fish as something else, like 'bird,' because sometimes I mix those up. I don't remember what else lives or grows in water, so I won't draw anything else. Does a fish need anything else? Maybe I'll put a circle for a rock. Rocks are important, right?",
  "Prompt": "A simple, colorful drawing done in crayon shows a fish with a basic shape: an oval-like body with a triangle on its top, possibly misunderstood as a fin or dorsal. The fish is surrounded by a wavy line intended to represent water. Next to the fish, there's a label saying 'bird.' Nearby, a simple outline of a circle is labeled 'food,' representing a rock. The drawing lacks additional details, such as plants or other animals, highlighting a minimalistic attempt.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt depicts what the student can do, like drawing a general shape of a fish with an added triangle for detail, and drawing wavy lines to represent water. It also includes their struggle with labeling, as shown by incorrect labels like 'bird' and 'food' for a rock. This aligns with their confusion and misunderstanding of the habitat and the ecological interactions of a fish."
