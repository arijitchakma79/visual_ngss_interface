  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing the fish in the middle of the page. I remember that fish need water to live, so I'll make sure it's surrounded by blue water. I'll also include some seaweed, because that's part of its habitat and provides oxygen and food for some creatures. Next, I'll draw a smaller fish because fish aren't alone in their habitat. They might swim together or nearby. I'll draw some bubbles near their mouths to show they need oxygen, and I'll label those bubbles as 'oxygen'. Behind the fish, I'll draw a couple of wavy lines to represent more plants, maybe even a rock to show different things in the environment. I'll label as much as I can: 'fish', 'water', 'seaweed', 'bubbles = oxygen', and 'small fish'. But sometimes I get mixed up, like I might forget to label something or label it incorrectly. I also miss showing two fish interacting beyond just being in the same space, like who eats what. But at least I can show theyâ€™re there together and the fish looks like it's part of its habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a small fish swimming in an underwater habitat. The fish is surrounded by light blue water, with green seaweed on either side. A smaller fish swims nearby, and there are bubbles labeled 'oxygen' around their mouths. There's also a rock and curvy lines to represent plants and the movement of water. Several labels are visible: 'fish', 'small fish', 'seaweed', 'bubbles = oxygen', and 'water'. The drawing is colorful and done in crayon, with some labels slightly misplaced or inconsistently placed.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict basic elements like fish, water, and seaweed and label them, aligning with the proficient level by including different organisms and showing the fish's needs. However, it also highlights the student's potential struggles with more complex interactions or perfectly accurate labeling, consistent with the occasional mistake expected at this skill level."
