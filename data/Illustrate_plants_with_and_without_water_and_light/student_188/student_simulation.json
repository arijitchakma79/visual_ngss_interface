  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing two separate frames on my paper, one for plants with water and light and one for plants without them. I remember that healthy plants should be shown with bright colors, so I'll use green for the leaves and brown for the soil, ensuring the stems look strong and the leaves look lush. I want to show droplets of water to indicate adequate water, and a bright shining sun overhead for light. In the second frame, I'll draw plants without water and light. For this, I'll make the leaves look wilted and use lighter, faded colors. I'll draw some drooping stems and dry soil. In terms of light, I will draw long, spindly stems with pale leaves suggesting they’re reaching out for scarce light. I might forget to label every single part of the plant accurately, but I'll focus on the details that show the conditions. I need to make sure the differences in my drawings are clear, so I'll use shading and different colors to emphasize the contrast between good and bad growing conditions. I'll try matching the sizes but sometimes they don't align perfectly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split-screen depiction of plants under different conditions. On one side, illustrate healthy plants with bright green lush leaves, thick sturdy stems, and dark brown soil. Add visual cues like blue water droplets and a bright yellow sun to indicate adequate water and light. On the opposite side, depict unhealthy plants with drooping, light green leaves, thin, spindly stems, and dry, cracked brown soil under a gray cloudy sky. Use coloring pencils for bright, vivid hues on the healthy plants and faded, pale colors for the unhealthy ones. Include distinct shading to highlight differences in plant conditions.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student’s ability to use visual cues such as drooping leaves and spindly stems to represent poor conditions and strong, lush images for healthy conditions, aligning with the advanced representation level. The use of color and shading helps emphasize differences between healthy and unhealthy plants, which is within the student's competence. Details like labeling or slight inconsistencies in size are not the main focus, as occasional omission of these elements is noted as a challenge for the student, not affecting their conceptual understanding."
