  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant. I remember that a plant with plenty of water and light will have vibrant green leaves and strong stems. I’ll draw a plant with large, dark green leaves and a thick stem. Next, I’ll illustrate a plant that doesn’t have enough water. The leaves should look wilting or droopy to show the plant is unhealthy, so I’ll draw them hanging down, with some parts slightly shriveled. Now, I'll draw a plant without enough light. These leaves should be pale or yellowish, and I’ll make them look a bit thinner and frailer. To clearly convey that plants need both water and light, I’ll add arrows or labels. I might have trouble remembering to label one part, but most of the important elements will be marked. Finally, I’ll compare the healthy plant to the two unhealthy ones by arranging them side by side to show the differences clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed, hand-drawn illustration of three plants side by side. The first plant is vibrant with lush, dark green leaves and a thick stem, showing it has plenty of water and light. The second plant has wilted, droopy leaves, indicating it lacks water, with some leaves curling slightly. The third plant has pale or yellowish leaves and a thin stem, signifying a lack of sufficient light. There are arrows and simple labels explaining that the first plant is healthy due to adequate light and water, with hints of missing labels in less critical areas of the drawing. The drawing is colorful, with a clear comparison between healthy and unhealthy plants, suitable for a 4th grade science project.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt encapsulates the student's abilities by clearly differentiating between healthy and unhealthy plants using visual cues (leaf color and position) and annotations. The emphasis is placed on conveying the plants’ conditions with accuracy and clarity, in line with the student’s level, while also representing minor missteps like partial labeling, which aligns with what the student might struggle with."
