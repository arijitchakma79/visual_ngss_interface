  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a basic plant with leaves and a stem because I remember that plants have these. I'll make one plant look healthier because I know that water and light make plants grow. So, I'll draw it with big green leaves. I'll try to show a plant without water by drawing the leaves a bit droopy. For the plant without light, I’m not quite sure how to show it. I’ll probably end up making it similar to the one without water, with smaller and less vibrant leaves. I'm going to draw both plants close together, and I think they’ll look a bit similar even though they're supposed to be different in terms of light. I’ll make sure there's some shading to try and show that one plant has light and the other doesn't, but it might not be too clear.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two side-by-side plants. The first plant has a straight, green stem and several large, vibrant green leaves. The second plant next to it has a similar shape but with slightly drooping leaves, a sign of wilting. The drawing style is simple and childlike, with colors in crayon or colored pencil. The background is a simple, pale blue color to imply sky and natural light, but the difference in light conditions isn't clearly distinguished.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do as it shows basic plant features like stems and leaves and depicts a plant appearing healthier with big leaves. It also reflects their struggle to differentiate between the effects of light and water clearly, as the plants appear similar in terms of light differences. The style is kept simple and childlike, indicating developing understanding."
