  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with basic features such as leaves and stems.",
    "The student can show a plant with water and light appearing somewhat healthier with larger leaves.",
    "The student might attempt to show a plant lacking water by drawing wilted leaves or drooping stems."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate the effects of light by showing a plant in the dark properly (may not differentiate well between with light and without light).",
    "The student may draw both plants without distinguishing between well-watered and lacking water (mixed success in showing differences).",
    "The student may misunderstand or inconsistently apply the concept that lack of light affects growth, perhaps showing two similar plants regardless of light differences."
