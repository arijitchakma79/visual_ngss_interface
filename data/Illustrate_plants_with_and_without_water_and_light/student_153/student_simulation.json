  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw pictures of plants and show how they look with plenty of water and light, and then without them. First, I'll start with the plant that has lots of water and light. I remember that these plants would look really healthy. I'll draw it with strong green leaves and a few bright flowers, maybe a sunny background with a water can nearby to show that it has plenty of water. Now I'll draw a plant without water. I think it would look kind of droopy and sad. I'll make its leaves wilted and maybe a little brown at the edges. I'll put a sun in the sky to show it still has light, but little or no water source, like an empty watering can. For the plant without light, I imagine it turning yellow since I know plants need sunlight for photosynthesis. I'll color it with paler, yellowish leaves and flowers to show it's not healthy. I'll draw it next to a shaded area, like under a big tree or building, and maybe no sun in the sky for emphasis. I'll label them, but sometimes I miss some parts. I'll try to label water, light, and the changes in the plants, but I might forget a leaf or small detail.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing three plants: one healthy with green leaves and colorful flowers in sunlight, a sun in the sky and a water can nearby; a second plant with wilted, brown-edged leaves and droopy flowers under direct sunlight but with an empty watering can nearby; a third plant with pale yellow leaves, no sun visible, under shadow of a large tree or building. Use labels like 'water', 'no water', 'light', 'no light' for clarity, but some labels may be missing on small details. The drawing should be colorful and appear as if done by a proficient student, using colored pencils with some incomplete or imprecise labeling.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's abilities because it captures the proficiency with overall visual elements like plant health and stress, using color and setting to show the impact of water and light. The inclusion of some labels reflects their understanding while acknowledging occasional lapses, like missing labels for smaller details. This is consistent with their occasional oversight of minor variations, such as all leaves not being perfectly colored to show stress."
