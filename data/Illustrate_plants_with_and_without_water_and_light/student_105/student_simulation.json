  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a plant, so I'll start with a simple shape. I'll make a line for the stem and a circle for the top to show the plant. Hmm, I remember that plants need water and light to grow, but I'm not sure how to show that they're different without them. I'll color the plant green because that's what I think a healthy plant looks like, and I like using green. I’m not sure how to make the plant look different if it doesn’t have water, so I'll leave it the same. For the plant with no light, I think I’ll just color it green too, because I’m not sure what else to do. The plants will probably all look alike, but I tried to make them. Maybe using different colors could help, but I don't know which ones. Okay, I’m done.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three simplistic plants. Each plant has a straight line for a stem and a green circle on top. All the plants are colored entirely in green, with no differences to indicate health or environmental conditions. The drawing is child-like, with crude lines and shapes, representing a beginner's attempt. There are no visual distinctions between the plants despite different labels like 'with water and light', 'without water', and 'without light'.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability and misunderstandings. They can draw basic plant shapes and attempt to use color but show all plants the same green regardless of environmental conditions. This represents their lack of understanding about the effects of water and light on a plant’s health, as they make no distinctions reflecting wilted plants or different scenarios. The drawing style is simple and child-like, matching the level description of beginning understanding where details are minimal and not scientifically accurate."
