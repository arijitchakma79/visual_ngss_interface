  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two plants side by side for easy comparison. On the left, I'll illustrate a plant with water and light. I remember that when a plant has both, it looks healthy and grows well, so I'll make sure to show lush green leaves and a sturdy, upright stem. Maybe I'll add a few flowers to emphasize its health. Next to it, I'll draw a plant without water. Without water, I recall plants begin to wilt and look dry, so I'll draw this plant with droopy, brownish leaves and a bent stem. For the plant without light, I'll think about how it becomes pale or yellow. I should focus on making the leaves look yellowish, and maybe the stem can be a bit bent to show it's not healthy. I'll make sure the background for this plant is dark to indicate absence of light. Occasionally, I do mix up parts sometimes like leaves and stems, but I'll try my best not to. Let's make sure each condition is distinct and clear, showing exactly what happens to plants when they lack water or light.",
  "Prompt": "A split illustration showing two scenarios: On the left, a healthy green plant with vibrant green leaves and young buds or flowers, well-lit by sunlight, sitting in a garden with a blue sky. On the right, a plant in two separate conditions: one plant with droopy, dry brown leaves and a sagging stem to indicate lack of water, with a clear, sunny background, and another plant with pale, yellowing leaves and a bent stem, surrounded by darkness to illustrate lack of light. The drawing is colorful, in a clear and detailed hand-drawn style suitable for an educational purpose, using colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants due to the availability of water and light as noted in their 'can do' capabilities. The different plant conditions, color selections, and distinct environmental representations are aligned with the advanced level of completion and accuracy. While the student is capable of producing a refined drawing, occasional minor errors are acknowledged, justifying the effort to differentiate leaves and stems correctly."
