  "Reasoning": "Okay, let's draw some plants! I remember plants need water and light to grow well. I'll start by drawing a healthy plant. I'll give it big, green leaves and a strong, tall stem. Now to show it has enough water and light, I’ll add a sun symbol above it and some raindrops nearby. For the plant without water, I’ll draw it with wilted leaves and drooping stems. I remember that without water, plants look sad and lifeless. For the plant without light, I think it should have pale or yellowing leaves because it can't photosynthesize properly. I’ll draw it looking kind of weak. Let’s see, I’ll add a cloud with a sun crossed out above it to show no light. For the plant with no water, I can have raindrops crossed out. I think I've mixed up the symbols before or maybe forgot to label them, so I’ll try my best not to. I'll make my drawings clear so you can see which plant has what problem.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three plants. The first plant is healthy with big, green leaves and a strong stem, surrounded by a sun and raindrops symbols. The second plant has wilted leaves and drooping stems, with raindrop symbols crossed out. The third plant has pale, yellowing leaves, with a cloud and sun crossed out symbol above. The drawing style is simple and colorful, like a school science project, with clear differences between the plants. Label each plant to indicate water and light availability accurately.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to clearly show a healthy plant with appropriate symbols for water and light, as well as representing plants lacking in water or light with appropriate physical signs like wilting or yellowing. The mention of simple and colorful aligns with their proficiency level while also acknowledging occasional mislabeling or unintentional synonymy between conditions, thus emphasizing clarity in symbols and labels to prevent confusion."
