  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves, so I’ll make sure the leaves are big and green. I'll draw some flowers too, because that shows it's doing really well. For the soil, I’ll draw it dark to show it’s wet because I remember it needs water. For the unhealthy plant without water, I’ll draw the leaves droopy and maybe some sticking out but curling at the edges. I know dry plants look shriveled, so I’ll use brown and yellow for the leaves. For the one without light, I’ll draw leaves that are kind of light green or yellowish because I read they turn pale. Oops, I almost forgot roots under my healthy plant, so I’ll quickly draw some small ones, but I might not get them perfect size or shape. Maybe I should add labels, but I might run out of space or forget some. I’ll write ‘needs water’ under the droopy plant and ‘needs light’ under the pale one. I just have to make sure there’s enough difference between all of them to show what’s happening.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of three plants on paper. The first plant is healthy, with big green leaves and colorful flowers, rooted in dark soil. The second plant is wilting, with droopy, brown, and yellow leaves. The third plant has pale, yellowish leaves due to lack of light. Roughly drawn roots under the healthy plant. Each plant has a simple label in a child's handwriting: 'has water and light', 'needs water', and 'needs light'. The drawing uses simple, vibrant colors and a basic, childlike art style.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict a healthy plant with green leaves and flowers and an unhealthy plant lacking water with droopy leaves. The student adds some differentiation by using colors like brown and yellow for different problems like lack of water and pale leaves for lack of light. The student includes labels that are simple, reflecting limited scientific vocabulary, and they might miss some detailed parts like properly scaled roots for the unhealthy plants, aligning with the incomplete understanding of plant parts."
