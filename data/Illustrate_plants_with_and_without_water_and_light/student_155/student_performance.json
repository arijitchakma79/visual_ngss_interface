  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a healthy, thriving plant with visible elements like green leaves and possibly flowers, indicating plenty of water and light.",
    "The student can draw a wilting or dried-out plant with drooping leaves to represent lack of water.",
    "The student can draw a plant with pale or yellowing leaves to show the effects of insufficient light.",
    "The student can show some distinction between healthy and unhealthy plants, potentially with scribbles or labels indicating differences in water and light availability.",
    "The student can use these drawings to partially explain why the healthy plant has what it needs to grow, though explanations may rely on simplistic terms or be slightly incomplete."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to articulate detailed scientific explanations about photosynthesis or the role of light and water beyond basic terms like 'need water' or 'needs light' (limited scientific vocabulary).",
    "The student might inconsistently label components in their drawings, or leave out communal elements like roots, especially for unhealthy plants (incomplete understanding of plant parts).",
    "The student might inaccurately depict scale or proportion among plant features, such as the relative size of leaves when comparing healthy and unhealthy plants (minor gaps in drawing detail)."
