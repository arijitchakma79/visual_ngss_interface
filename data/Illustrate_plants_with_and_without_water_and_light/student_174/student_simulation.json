  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw some plants and show how they look with water and light, and then without each. I'll start with the healthy plant. I remember that when plants have water and light, they grow tall and strong, with lots of green leaves. So, I'll draw a tall plant with big, green leaves under a bright yellow sun and a blue drop of water next to the soil. Now, for the plant without water—I know it should look wilted because plants droop when they're thirsty. I'll draw the same plant but with its leaves drooping and a greyish tint to the leaves. There won't be a water drop. Next is the plant without light. I think the plant should look similar to the thirsty one, maybe drooping too. I'll draw it with droopy leaves but make them a bit lighter in color, without the sun in the sky this time. Oops, I think I forgot to label the sun or the water drop in one or more spots—I'll have to be careful! But I can definitely show that the healthy plant stands taller and greener than the unhealthy ones. That should show I understand plants need both water and light.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three plants on white paper. The first plant, on the left, is healthy and green, with large lush leaves and standing upright under a bright sun. There's a blue water droplet near the base of this plant. The second plant, in the middle, looks wilted with drooping, grey-tinged leaves; there's no water droplet. The third plant, on the right, also looks wilted with lighter, faint leaves and no sun in the sky. The drawing is colorful, with a child-like style, simple shapes, and clear differences in plant posture and color.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's abilities by clearly depicting the healthy plant as vibrant with water and light, while the wilted plants show a lack of these elements. The differences in the droopiness and color of the leaves communicate the student’s understanding of plant needs, despite possible slight inconsistencies in labeling, aligning with their partial understanding of the specific effects of lacking water versus light."
