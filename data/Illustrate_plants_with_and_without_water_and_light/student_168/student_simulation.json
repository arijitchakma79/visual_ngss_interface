  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two sections. On the left, I'll draw a plant with water and light. I’ll make sure it looks healthy, with green leaves and some flowers to show it’s thriving. I’ll add a sun in the corner to show it has light and maybe a water droplet near the roots to show it has water. For the plant without water, I’ll draw it drooping with wilted, brown leaves. I’ll add a note like 'needs water' next to it. When I draw a plant without light, I sometimes forget it should look different than without water. I might make it look only a little wilted instead of really showing it’s struggling to grow. I remember to add a sun symbol for light, but I might not clearly show the lack of growth. I have to remember to label things, but sometimes when I focus on the plant details, I forget to add notes in all parts of the drawing.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two sections: one with a healthy plant under a bright sun with green leaves and flowers, plus a water droplet symbol; the other with one plant showing wilted, brown leaves with a 'needs water' note, and another plant slightly wilted under a dim sun. Use colored pencils with green, brown, and yellow being prominent. The style is simple and child-like, with clear emphasis on the healthy plant's details but less clarity on the plant without light.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by depicting clear distinctions between plants with and without water, as well as incorporating symbols like the sun for light and water droplets. It shows where the student might struggle, such as inconsistently depicting a plant without light as unhealthy, focusing attention on the healthy plant but making the plant without light look only slightly wilted. Labels and notes like 'needs water' are included but might be missing in one area due to the student's natural variation in focus."
