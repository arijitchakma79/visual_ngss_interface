  "Reasoning": "I remember that my teacher said plants need water and light to be healthy. I'll start by drawing a healthy plant with water and sunlight. I'll draw the plant with a big, green stem and some leaves, but I might not get all the details right, like the number of leaves or their shapes. Next, I'll draw a plant without water. I know it should look unhealthy, so I'll try to make the leaves droop a bit to show it's thirsty. Sometimes, I get confused and make it look like the plant without light, but I'll try to keep them different. Now, I'll draw a plant without light. I think it should look unhealthy too, maybe with fewer leaves. I usually forget to show things like it's not growing tall. I have a hard time telling the differences between the plants I draw without water and without light. I'll try my best, but I know I mix them up sometimes.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three potted plants on a white background drawn in a childlike, sketchy style with colored pencils. The first plant is healthy with a bright green stem and a few green leaves, indicating water and sunlight. The second plant looks unhealthy with a slightly droopy stem and leaves, suggesting lack of water but similar in appearance to the third plant. The third plant also looks unhealthy, possibly with fewer leaves to suggest lack of light, but lacking specific growth indicators. Use simple colors like green and brown, with attempts at shading.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by showing a healthy plant with some basic elements like a stem and leaves, but lacking detailed differentiation. The plant without water is shown with drooping leaves, which the student can do, though these signs may be confused with other issues. The same goes for the plant without light, which lacks specific growth indicators. Overall, the drawing style is childlike, aligning with the student's developing level and potential misunderstandings."
