  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a healthy plant. I remember that a plant with enough water and light has vibrant green leaves. I’ll make sure the leaves look full and bright green. I'll draw a light source, like the sun, shining on the plant to indicate it has enough light. I’ll use some arrows to show the sunlight direction. Now I'll draw a second plant without water. I think the leaves should look droopy and maybe a bit brown to show it's wilting. For the plant without light, I'll draw another plant but give it pale, stretched-out stems to show it's reaching towards the light. I should remember to include arrows here too, but sometimes I forget to label things accurately like light direction, so I might miss a light label. I’ll try my best to show the differences in leaf color and plant posture for each scenario. I’ll label the plants to indicate 'healthy', 'no water', and 'no light'. I hope I don't miss any labels this time.",
  "Prompt": "Drawing of three plants side by side. The first plant is healthy with vibrant green leaves and a sun shining above it, with arrows indicating bright sunlight. The second plant has drooping, slightly brown leaves to show it lacks water. The third plant is pale with elongated stems to suggest it lacks light. The plants are labeled 'healthy', 'no water', and 'no light', respectively. Use color pencils for vibrant colors in a realistic and clear sketch, but some labels may be missing or not precise.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate plant health differences with vivid leaves, drooping signs, and pale, elongated stems, which aligns with the described understanding of plant needs for water and light. The potential omission of a label or inaccurate depiction of light impact reflects the student's struggle with labeling and emphasizing light effects clearly, consistent with the 'cannot' aspects."
