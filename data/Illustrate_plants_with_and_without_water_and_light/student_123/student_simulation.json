  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a plant. Hmm, I remember that plants have a stem, so I'll make a tall green line as the stem. Then plants have leaves, so I'll draw some oval shapes coming out from the stem. I know plants need a sun, so I'll draw a big yellow circle in the corner, but I'll just put it anywhere since it's just a sun in the sky. Maybe I'll draw clouds too, since it sometimes rains. I'll add them without worrying too much about where they are. Oh, and I'll draw another plant next to it because I need to show different kinds. I won't do anything different, though, because both need to look like plants to me. Maybe I'll put some blue squiggles around for water, but I’ll put them without any particular focus. Both plants look the same to me, happy and green, because I think just having a sun and water everywhere is fine.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple drawing of two plants. Each plant has a green stem and several green oval leaves. In the sky, there's a large, yellow sun to one side and some fluffy white clouds scattered around. The ground is just a solid brown color, with no distinct texture. Some blue squiggles are evenly distributed around the plants, representing water. The plants appear identical in color and health, with no signs of wilt or stress. The style is childlike and simplistic, with basic shapes and vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's style of drawing basic plant features without distinguishing plant health based on water or light, as they all look identical. The sun, clouds, and water elements are included, but their placement doesn't make a clear connection to plant health, demonstrating the student's struggle to show the necessity of correct light and water application. This aligns with the student's beginning level of understanding where all plants are drawn similarly, regardless of environmental conditions."
