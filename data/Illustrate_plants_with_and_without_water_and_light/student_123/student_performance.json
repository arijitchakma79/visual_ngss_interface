  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a simple shape that resembles a plant with basic features like a stem and leaves, but without distinguishing factors for health (e.g., all plants look similar regardless of water or light availability).",
    "The student may attempt to add elements like a sun or a cloud, but their placement or meaning is unclear (e.g., randomly placed without indicating light source)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to represent the concept of a healthy plant due to a lack of water *or* light (e.g., all plants look the same, no understanding of wilting or discoloration).",
    "The student may not differentiate between a plant with water and one without (e.g., no water indicator or all plants drawn on dry ground).",
    "The student may misunderstand the growth process and show plants in unrealistic contexts (e.g., floating in the air, colors not matching plant parts like purple roots).",
    "No clear indication that plants require light for growth (e.g., sun may be omitted or inconsistently drawn with no connection to plant health)."
