  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a healthy plant with lots of green leaves and maybe some flowers to show it's getting enough water and light. I'll make sure it looks upright and vibrant. To show a plant without water, I’ll draw it drooping with fewer leaves and make it look kind of limp or brownish. For the plant without light, I remember it's supposed to be not growing well, so I'll draw leaves that are small and maybe a bit yellow. I’m not sure how each leaf's texture should be, but I’ll focus on showing the difference between the healthy and unhealthy plants clearly. I will use labels, but I might forget to label some parts, like which plant is missing what, but I’ll try to label the most important parts. Finally, I'll compare the healthy and unhealthy plants by putting them side by side and making sure the differences are obvious.",
  "Prompt": "A three-panel drawing of plants illustrating their responses to water and light availability. On the left, a lush, green plant with full leaves and a small flower, representing ample water and light, is displayed. On the middle panel, a plant without water is depicted with drooping yellowish-brown leaves, some leaves fallen around the pot, illustrating the negative impact of water scarcity. On the right, a plant missing light is shown, featuring smaller, slightly yellow leaves and a stunted appearance. The background is simple, and each plant stands in a separate pot on a surface. Labels like 'With Water and Light', 'Without Water', and 'Without Light' are included but may be inconsistent or missing in detail. The style should be in a child-like, colored pencil sketch with clear differences but not overly detailed.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict healthy vs. unhealthy plants based on water and light, using color changes like browns and yellows to show wilting or stunted growth. It accounts for the proficiency level by clearly showing contrasts but allows for minor lapses in labeling and detail, aligning with the student's challenges like inconsistent labeling and not perfectly gauging wilting severity."
