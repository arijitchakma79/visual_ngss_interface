  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two sets of plants to show how water and light affect their health. First, I'll draw a healthy plant getting water and light. I know the leaves should be green, and the plant should stand upright. Next to it, I'll draw a plant without water; it should look wilted with drooping leaves. For the second set, I'll draw another healthy plant with light and water. The other plant will be placed in the dark but might not look as bad as it should; I'll draw some yellowing but not enough to show full impact. I should label the conditions above each plant, but sometimes I forget a label. I'll try to remember to label 'no water' and 'in dark' clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two pairs of potted plants on white paper. The first pair has a plant on the left that is healthy, with green, upright leaves. Above it, label 'with water & light'. On the right, draw a plant with drooping, dry-looking leaves. Above it, label 'no water'. For the second pair, draw another healthy plant on the left with green leaves and upright stems. Above it, label 'with water & light'. On the right, sketch a plant with some yellow-tinted leaves, slightly bent over. Label it 'in dark', though be careful that one label might be missing. Use colored pencils for a neat, detailed look. The drawings should clearly show differences but expect some minor inconsistencies in labeling or coloring.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw and label healthy and wilted plants due to lack of water. It also considers the student's slight difficulty in illustrating the full impact of darkness on plants, resulting in partial yellowing instead of complete. The prompt includes the potential for incomplete labeling, consistent with the student's proficiency level."
