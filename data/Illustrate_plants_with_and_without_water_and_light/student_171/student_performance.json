    "The student can draw two plants, one receiving water and light, and one without water. The plant with water and light looks healthy, while the one without water appears wilted.",
    "The student can draw another two plants, one receiving light and water, and one placed in the dark. The plant in the dark appears not to be growing and may have yellow leaves.",
    "The student can illustrate drying and wilting for a plant that doesnâ€™t get water, showing some level of detail (e.g., drooping leaves).",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label parts of plants or conditions (e.g., forgetting to label 'no water' on one diagram).",
    "The student might slightly misdraw the impact of lack of light, with plants being a bit less vibrant than accurate representations (e.g., partial yellowing when full yellowing is expected)."
