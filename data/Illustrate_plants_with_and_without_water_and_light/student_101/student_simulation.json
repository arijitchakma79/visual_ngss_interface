  "Reasoning": "I’ll begin by drawing a big shape that looks like a plant. I'll draw a straight line for the stem and some lines coming off it for the leaves. I remember that the roots are at the bottom, so I’ll add some squiggly lines there. I'll try to do this for two plants. One plant will have raindrops around it, which means it has water. I’ll do the same drawing next to it for a plant without raindrops for no water. For the light, I’m not exactly sure how to show it, but maybe if one has a sun or something on it? But I think both plants look the same, just ones with extra things like drops or a sun. I don’t really get why they’d look different or if they need these things. I think I’m done.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, childlike crayon drawing of two identical, basic plants with roots, stem, and leaves. One plant has raindrop shapes around it, and the other plant is the same but without raindrops. Both plants have a sun drawn above them, with both plants looking healthy and green. Colors should be simple, using green for plants, blue for water drops, and yellow for the sun.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student’s ability to create basic plant shapes and inconsistently include elements like roots, stem, and leaves. The student doesn't change the plant's appearance based on water or light presence, showing limited understanding of water's or light’s role in growth. Instead, the same plant appears with additional icons like raindrops and a sun symbol, demonstrating their beginning level and misconceptions."
