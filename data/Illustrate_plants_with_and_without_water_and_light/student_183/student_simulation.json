  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant first. I remember that healthy plants have vibrant green leaves, and their stems stand tall, so I’ll make sure to draw that. I’ll show the soil as moist with a darker shade to indicate it has enough water. Next, I’ll illustrate the light source, maybe the sun, shining on the plant because I know plants need light to grow well. Now, for the plant without water, I’ll draw one with drooping stems and brown leaves. The soil will look dry and cracked to show it lacks water. I remember the difference in plant growth between light and darkness, so I’ll include another plant with stunted growth but in a dark, shaded area. I’ll try to illustrate the pattern of how plants need both water and light by showing stages of growth, like a sequence from a wilting to a flourishing plant. Oh, but I might forget to label the parts of the plant or miss out on some small details like the roots’ health differences. Even though I know these details, sometimes I forget to include them.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate two plants side-by-side. On the left, draw a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves standing tall in dark, moist soil, and visible sunlight. On the right, depict a wilted plant with brown leaves in dry, cracked soil, and no sunlight. Include another side-by-side comparison of a plant in light with robust growth and another in darkness with stunted growth. Show a sequence of plant growth stages to illustrate the concept of needing water and light, using colors like green, brown, and earth tones. Use a slightly sketchy style to reflect a student’s hand-drawn effort.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by describing the healthy and wilted plants clearly with their respective soil conditions, and showing the difference in plant growth with and without light. It captures the illustration of patterns in growth stages. The sketchy style captures the student's level of drawing as described. The omission of labels and root health differences aligns with the student's minor oversights and omitted small details."
