  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a plant that looks healthy first. I know it needs both water and light, so I’ll use a green color to make it look lively. I should make it a bit taller too, since that means it’s doing well. For the plant without water, I’ll try to make it look droopy, maybe by drawing its leaves hanging down. Now, for the plant with light, I’ll add more green and maybe larger leaves to show it’s growing well, but I need to be careful not to make it look the same as the well-watered one. For the plant without light, I think it should look different, but I’m not sure; maybe I’ll make it a bit shriveled too, even though I can get mixed up with how that looks like lacking water. I’ll just use the same kind of green since it’s a plant, after all.",
  "Prompt": "Draw four potted plants side by side. The first plant is healthy, with tall, vibrant green stems and leaves, showing that it has plenty of water and light. The second plant lacks water, appearing shorter and with droopy, hanging leaves; use a less vibrant green. The third plant has light but lacks water; it has larger leaves, still vibrant green, but might not clearly show differences. The fourth plant lacks light and is a bit shriveled, but like plant two, might not clearly differ or might look similarly droopy. Use a simple, child-like drawing style with crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it allows them to show some level of understanding of how plants should look if they are healthy, with greener and taller depictions. However, it reflects their struggle to differentiate distinct symptoms of lacking water versus lacking light, as both are depicted using common features like droopiness or muted colors without clear distinction. The child-like drawing style reinforces their developing understanding level."
