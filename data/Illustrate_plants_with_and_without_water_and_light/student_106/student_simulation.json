  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant, because I know that plants need water and light to grow. I remember that healthy plants are green, so I’ll use green to show the leaves and stem. I'll try to draw another plant next to it, but I am not sure how to show that it's unhealthy because I don't really know what it needs differently. Maybe I’ll just draw it a little less clearly. For the background, I'm thinking I’ll add a big sun to represent light because that's what plants need. I know the ground is where water comes from, but I don't quite know how to show if the plant has enough water or not, so it’ll just be plain. I'm not sure how to draw a plant in darkness or without water, so I’ll leave that idea out.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing of two plants. One plant is a basic, simple green shape with a green stem and leaves. The second plant is less defined and slightly scribbled. Above the plants, there is a large yellow sun to represent light. The ground is brown, plain, and does not show additional details about water. The overall drawing is simplistic, colorful, and lacks nuanced details about plant health.",
  "Explaination": "The image matches what the student can do because it captures a basic representation of a plant with minimal understanding of plant needs. The student uses color to represent green plants and a sun for light but struggles to show differences in plant health or illustrate the absence of water and light. This aligns with the struggle to demonstrate plant needs through detailed illustration."
