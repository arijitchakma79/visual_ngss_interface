  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant that has enough water and light. I remember that healthy plants have vibrant green leaves and upright stems, so I'll make sure to draw those details clearly. Next, I'll illustrate a plant that doesn't get enough water. I know that plants without enough water have wilting leaves and drooping stems, so I'll draw that. A dried-out plant pot should also show that it's lacking water, so I'll include a few cracks or dryness signs on the pot. Now, I'll draw a plant that doesn't get enough light. I'll make the leaves look a bit pale or yellowish because I remember that plants without enough light can have those colors. I'll try to show the plant in a shaded area, but I sometimes miss drawing elongated stems, so I'll just focus on making it look spindly and weak. I have to be careful to show dried leaves correctly, but sometimes I forget some parts, so they might look only partially dried.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a series of three plants side by side on a single page. The first plant is healthy, with vibrant green leaves and upright stems, indicative of getting sufficient water and light. The second plant should show signs of not getting enough water, with wilting leaves and drooping stems; the plant pot is visibly dried out, with cracks. The third plant lacks sufficient light, with spindly and weak structure, pale or yellowish leaves, and it should be positioned in a shaded area. Use colored pencils with emphasis on green for healthy, shades of dull green and brown for water-lacking, and yellowish green for light-lacking plants. Drawing style should be basic yet earnest, reflecting an elementary understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by including vibrant green leaves and upright stems for healthy plants, signs of wilting and drooping for water-deprived plants, and pale, weak features for light-deprived plants. It reflects the student's ability to depict these conditions, while also acknowledging potential issues like missing elongated stems for light-deprived plants and partial understanding in drawing completely dried leaves."
