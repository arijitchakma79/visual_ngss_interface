  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant that has enough water and light. I know the plant should look healthy, so I'll make the leaves nice and green, but I might forget to show extra details like flowers that fully open. Next, I'll draw a plant that's not getting any water. I think plants without water will droop, so I'll make the stem bent over and maybe a few leaves looking down, but I might not change the color or size of the leaves. Then, I'll draw a plant that's not getting light. I remember that plants without light might grow in weird shapes, so I'll make this plant smaller and bent, but I might forget to show other signs like yellow leaves. I hope my drawings show they're different, but I often forget to label them or show all the reasons why light and water matter.",
  "Prompt": "A triptych of simple, hand-drawn plants in colored pencil. The first drawing shows a basic plant with green leaves, slightly growing but missing detailed flowers. The second drawing depicts a plant with a bent stem, indicative of wilting due to lack of water, but leaves color is unchanged. The third drawing features a smaller, slightly bent plant to show lack of light, without the additional sign of yellow leaves. The style is childlike and straightforward, emphasizing primary forms over intricate details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to present a general idea of how plants react to water and light, with basic signs of growth, wilting, and underdevelopment. However, it also incorporates their limitations in conveying detailed changes like leaf color or properly labeling the differences, aligning with their described capacities and struggles."
