  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic representation of a plant that is receiving water and light, showing it with some signs of growth but might miss details or accuracy in depicting health, like fully opened flowers or vibrant leaves.",
    "The student can draw a plant without water and may attempt to show it wilting, but the signs of wilting might be simplistic or incorrect (e.g., just a drooping stem without leaf changes).",
    "The student can draw a plant without light and include some indication of underdevelopment, such as a smaller or bent plant, but may not accurately depict the effects of light absence with details like yellowing leaves."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate all detailed differences between plants with and without adequate light or water (e.g., they might not show differences in leaf color or size) *(missing detailed differences)*.",
    "The student might not consistently label patterns in their drawing that indicate lack of water or light, such as the difference in the plant's height or leaf appearance between scenarios *(incomplete labeling of patterns)*.",
    "The student is unlikely to effectively use the drawing to clearly communicate the concept that plants need both water and light to thrive, possibly omitting cause-and-effect relationships or failing to make this connection explicit *(incomplete understanding of cause-effect)*."
