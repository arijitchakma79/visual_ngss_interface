  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant with green leaves. I remember that plants need water and light to stay healthy, so I'll make the leaves look nice and green. I think they should look full and lively, so I'll make them a little bigger with some veins. Next to it, I will try to draw a plant that didn't get enough water. I know wilting happens, but I'm not sure exactly how to show that, so I'll just make the leaves droopy and maybe a bit brown. Now, I should think about drawing a plant without light, but I'm not sure how to draw something in the dark. Maybe if I add some shadow or make it a little gray? Hmm, I'll just focus more on the water part. Now, I want to try showing a difference between the green plant and the wilting one. Maybe the wilting one should look smaller and sad, but I might not make a big change since I'm not exactly sure how to show a plant without light clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two plants side by side. The first plant is healthy with big, green leaves that are vibrant and shown under bright light. The second plant is wilting, with droopy, browning leaves, trying to show it lacks water, but still somewhat faint. The background should be plain, with an attempt to show some shadow or gray to suggest lack of light, but not very clear. Use colored pencils or crayons to show simplistic lines and bright greens and browns.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by focusing on drawing a healthy, green plant to show understanding of water and light benefits, while making an effort for the second plant to look deprived of water with droopy leaves. The student's difficulty with depicting light deprivation is addressed with an unclear attempt to show shadows or gray. Simplistic elements and bright colors denote emerging understanding, reflecting the student's developing level."
