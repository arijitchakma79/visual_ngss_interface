  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with green leaves, indicating it gets enough water and light, but details may be simplistic or incomplete.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to consistently draw a plant in a dark place, possibly placing it in a setting that is not clearly dark (e.g., partial shadow or unclear background).",
    "The student is unable to clearly use their drawings to demonstrate that plants need both water and light to live and grow, often missing one of the elements (e.g., focuses only on water).",
    "The student finds it challenging to accurately draw a comparison that highlights the differences between plants with water and light and those without, potentially showing another plant with unclear symptoms of light deprivation."
