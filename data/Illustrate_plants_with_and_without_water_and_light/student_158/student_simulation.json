  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two rows of plants. For the first row, I'll draw three healthy plants. Since plants need water and sunlight to thrive, I’ll make these plants bright green and vibrant to show they are well-cared-for. I'll add a sun symbol above them to indicate they get sunlight, and a wavy blue line to show they receive water. For the second row, I’ll draw plants that don’t have water or sunlight. I'll try using a yellowish color to show they don't have enough light, but I might not make the yellow very noticeable. I’ll also attempt to show plants without water by drawing a couple wilted, but might not get the colors to look brown enough. Finally, I'll add arrows pointing up next to the healthy plants to show their growth pattern.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two rows of cartoon-style plants. The top row should have three healthy, vibrant green plants with a bright sun symbol above and wavy blue lines representing water nearby. The bottom row should depict three plants with dull, slightly yellowish hues and less vibrant colors, indicating less sunlight. Include small hints of wilting. Above these are no sun symbols or water lines. Add arrows pointing upwards next to the healthy plants to depict growth direction.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures that the student can depict healthy plants with bright, vibrant colors and the presence of water and sunlight symbols. The student attempts to show plants without enough sunlight as slightly yellowed, but they may not appear dramatically different. For plants without water, they try to draw wilting with color usage but may not be distinct. The effort shows proficiency with minor inaccuracies expected at this level."
