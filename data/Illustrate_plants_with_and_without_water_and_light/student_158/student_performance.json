  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently show wilted or browning plants when illustrating a lack of water, as there could be some slight inaccuracies in colouring or size due to natural variation in drawing skill.",
    "The student might underrepresent or not fully detail yellowing in plants when there is an absence of light, possibly showing only slight changes in coloration rather than dramatic differences (e.g., use of too subtle yellow tones that are not easily seen)."
