  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw plants with and without water and light. I'll start with the healthy plant. I remember that when a plant has enough water and light, it should have strong, green leaves and a sturdy stem. So I'll make sure to draw nice, vibrant green leaves and a straight stem for this one. Now for the plant without enough water. The leaves should be droopy because they don't have enough moisture. I’ll try to show them hanging down a bit. Next, for the plant that lacks light, the leaves are pale and might look weak. I’ll draw them with a lighter green color, and maybe a bit thinner to show they aren’t as strong. But wait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing up droopy and pale. Sometimes I get those two confused. I’ll focus on this so I draw it right this time. Now, let’s add some sunlight to the healthy plant to show it’s thriving. I'll draw the sunlight streaming onto it. Ah, I nearly forgot to make the droopy leaves look droopy. Let me fix that by making them angle more towards the ground.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn style image of three potted plants side by side. The first plant is healthy with vibrant green, strong leaves and a straight stem, and sunlight shining on it, depicting its thriving condition. The second plant shows droopy, wilted leaves indicating a lack of water; the leaves are angled downwards and look a bit dull. The third plant has pale, weak-looking leaves suggesting a lack of light, with the leaves appearing lighter green and thinner. The drawing has a sketch-like style with attention to color differences to portray plant health conditions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do, like showing a healthy plant with strong leaves and depicting weak plants due to lack of water and light. It also reflects the student's struggle with consistent depiction by making sure droopy and pale symptoms aren't mixed up, matching their proficient level with minor inconsistencies."
