  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic plant shape with minimal details. (e.g., a simple stem and leaves)",
    "The student may attempt to show differences but inconsistently apply them. (e.g., varying the color or size without understanding the cause)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately illustrate the effects of lack of water, showing no noticeable difference in plant appearance. (student doesn’t understand water’s role in plant health)",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate the effects of lack of light, perhaps making arbitrary changes that do not reflect reality (e.g., darker or wilting leaves).",
    "The student may not distinguish between plants that have sufficient and insufficient resources in their drawings. (student lacks understanding of resource needs)",
    "The student's attempt to show the difference between healthy and unhealthy plants might be inconsistent or based on unclear criteria. (e.g., random changes in leaf shape without reason)"
