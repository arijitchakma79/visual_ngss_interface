  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a basic plant. I remember plants have stems and leaves, so I'll draw a straight stem with a leaf or two on each side. Since I'm supposed to show plants with and without water and light, I'll try to make some differences between them. For the plant without water, hmm, maybe I should make it smaller or give it fewer leaves. I’m not really sure what happens when a plant doesn’t get water. For the plant without light, maybe I should make it darker because it's supposed to be in the dark. But I’m not sure if that’s right. Both plants will look mostly the same because I think they all need those things, but I don’t really know how to show it clearly. I’ll just change a bit here and there so they look different, just not sure why exactly.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants side by side. Both have a basic structure with a straight green stem and a few green leaves. The plant on the left is slightly smaller with fewer leaves, to show a plant without water. The plant on the right is drawn with slightly darker leaves to represent a plant without light. The drawing uses basic colors with minimal shading, reflecting a child’s drawing style. There are minor size and color differences between the two plants, but overall, they remain quite similar in appearance.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's skill level because it represents their ability to draw simple plant shapes with minimal details, like a stem and a few leaves. The differences between the plants are arbitrary and do not accurately illustrate the effects of water and light deprivation, aligning with the students' misunderstanding of these concepts. The variations in size and color are inconsistent, reflecting the student's level of understanding and reasoning."
