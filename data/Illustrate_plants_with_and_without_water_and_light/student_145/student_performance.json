  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate plants with enough water and light by showing them as somewhat healthy and growing, but details might be minimal or vague.",
    "The student can show plants without enough water as wilting, although the depiction might lack consistency across different examples.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show a clear pattern that plants need both water and light to live and grow; they might depict one element (water or light) inconsistently.",
    "The student may struggle to illustrate different environments accurately; they might place a plant under a porch in full sun, misunderstanding how light affects plant growth.",
    "The student might not clearly differentiate between plants with different deficiencies, such as confusing the symptoms of too little water and too little light (e.g., showing both as wilting)."
