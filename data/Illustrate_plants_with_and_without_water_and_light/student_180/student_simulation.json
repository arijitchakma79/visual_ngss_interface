  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different plants â€“ one with water and light, and one without enough. I remember that plants need water and light to be healthy and grow well. First, I'm going to draw a healthy plant. I'll make it tall with bright green leaves because I know that means it's growing well. To show it's in the light, I'll color the area around it in a light yellow, like sunlight. Next, I'll draw a plant without enough water. I think it should look wilted, so I'm going to draw the leaves droopy and use a lighter green to show it's drying out. Last, I'll draw a plant without enough light. I'll make this plant also look droopy and use a palette of dull green and grey to suggest it's not as healthy. I need to use colors carefully to show where there's more light and where there isn't, but I sometimes get confused with shading so that might not be perfect. There should be a clear pattern that compares these plants and shows they aren't growing well without water and light.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two illustrations side by side. On the left, depict a thriving plant with tall, vibrant green leaves under a warm, yellowish light, showing it's well-watered and well-lit. On the right, draw two wilting plants: one without enough water with droopy, lighter green, and drying leaves; another without enough light with limp, dull green to grey leaves. Use colors to highlight differences in lighting, with clear sunlight hitting the healthy plant but subtle shading indicating lack of light for the wilting plants. Background should imply an indoor setting with a window casting light on the healthy plant.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to differentiate between conditions for plant health accurately, using colors to indicate light presence and plant vitality. It also acknowledges the minor gap in consistent color shading, as noted in the 'cannot' skill, by suggesting shading nuances that might not be perfect yet represent the learning goal."
