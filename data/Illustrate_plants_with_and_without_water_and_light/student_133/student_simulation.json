  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant with both water and light. I remember that healthy plants should look sturdy, so I’ll make sure my plant has a strong, straight stem and some big, green leaves. Now, for the plant that doesn’t get enough water—I recall learning that they wilt, so I’ll draw some drooping leaves here. But I’m not exactly sure what happens when the plant doesn’t get enough light. I’ve heard that sometimes they get yellowish, but I also remember them drooping, so I might get that mixed up. I’ll try to show this plant with some droopy leaves too, but I’m not sure if I’m doing it right. Now, for the comparison... I should make them side by side to show the differences, but I need to remember which signs go with which lack of resources.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple illustration of three plants side by side. The first plant is healthy, with a straight, sturdy stem and broad, green leaves. The second plant lacks water, depicted with drooping leaves but maintaining green color. The third plant is without light, drawn with drooping green leaves rather than elongated stems or yellowing. Use a minimalistic and child-like drawing style with basic colors mainly consisting of green and brown.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities and misunderstandings. The student can correctly show a healthy plant and a plant without water using drooping leaves. However, the student does not accurately show the effect of lacking light, mistakenly using drooping leaves instead of yellowing or elongation. The side-by-side comparison is attempted but with signs matched incorrectly, reflecting both their attempt to compare and their confusion in correctly distinguishing the symptoms of each deficiency."
