  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant that has both water and light. I remember that when plants are healthy, they have vibrant green leaves, and they stand up straight, so I'll make sure to draw the leaves looking full and upright, with a nice green color. I'll include the roots that are fanning out under the soil, a strong stem, and if there's room, maybe a flower to show extra health. Next, I'll draw a plant without water. I know that when there's no water, the leaves droop and start turning yellow, so I'll make sure to depict the leaves hanging down and add some yellow spots. The roots will look a bit shriveled. For the plant without light, I'll draw it with long, spindly stems because plants stretch towards light. The leaves might be pale or discolored, so I'll use lighter greens or even some gray shades for them. I know I need to label the major parts: roots, stem, leaves, and if possible flowers. I can do that, but sometimes I mix up the terms, like calling the stem a stalk, but I'll do my best to avoid this. While I remember to label all parts in my first drawing, I might miss some in the second and third if I get too focused on showing how they look. I want to make sure all four drawings clearly show that both water and light are necessary for a healthy plant.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate four different drawings of a plant with a focus on demonstrating the effects of water and light. The first drawing shows a healthy and growing plant, characterized by vibrant green leaves, a strong stem, and visible flowers, set in clear daylight. The second drawing depicts a plant wilting due to lack of water, with drooping leaves and yellow spots, the soil looking dry. The third drawing shows a plant without light, featuring spindly, elongated stems, and pale, discolored leaves. The fourth drawing contrasts these elements, demonstrating the overall need for both water and light. All drawings include root systems. Use a realistic style with clear labels for roots, stem, leaves, and flowers, and employ vivid colors to highlight differences.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by describing how they demonstrate the need for water and light through contrasting healthy and unhealthy plants. The prompt includes realistic detailing like vibrant or pale colors of leaves and different plant structures to represent varying conditions. It allows for minor inconsistencies, such as differing levels of detail in roots or occasional mislabeling, which aligns with what the student struggles with. Overall, the drawings reflect a comprehensive understanding of the topic, as the student attempts to accurately depict and label the major parts and characteristics of the plants under different conditions."
