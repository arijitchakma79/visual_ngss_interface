  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a healthy plant. I remember that a healthy plant needs both water and light, so I'll make sure to draw it big and with lots of green leaves. Now for the unhealthy plant that doesn't have water. I know it should look wilted, maybe with sagging leaves. I'll make it smaller too. Now, the plant without light — it probably doesn't grow as tall, so I'll draw it shorter and maybe with fewer leaves, although I sometimes mix up what exact effect a lack of light has. I'm going to label each plant so it's clear if they had water and light, though sometimes my labels are not very detailed. I think the healthy plant label will say 'with water and light', the second plant 'without water', and the third one 'without light', even though I might confuse what they exactly look like. Because I usually miss or mix up parts when showing different water levels, I won’t focus on that much and will keep them similar. Okay, let's start drawing!",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three plants on a sunny day: The first plant is tall and lush with green leaves, showing a healthy plant that had adequate water and light. The second plant is smaller, with drooping leaves, indicating a lack of water. The third plant is short with fewer leaves, illustrating a plant that didn't get enough light. Labels are above each plant: 'water and light', 'without water', and 'without light'. The labels are clear but not detailed. The style is child-drawn and colorful with noticeable differences in the plants' sizes and conditions.",
  "Explaination": "The description shows the student's ability to draw a healthy plant accurately with water and light. It also captures the struggle where the student sometimes confuses effects of insufficient water or light, leading to imperfections in the drooping and size differences of the unhealthy plants. The labels are included to highlight the student's proficiency, though they lack detail, and the representation of varying water levels may be inconsistent or minimal, aligning with the student's level and abilities."
