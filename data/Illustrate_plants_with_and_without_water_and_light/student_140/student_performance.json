  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with both water and sunlight, but may show it only slightly healthier than the others (e.g., bigger leaves, but lacks other healthy features).",
    "The student might draw a plant without water and depict it wilting or drooping, showing some understanding of water's role.",
    "The student can attempt to draw a plant without sunlight and may show it growing sideways or with smaller leaves, indicating some understanding of sunlight's effects.",
    "The student may use simple observations to show a pattern (e.g., fewer leaves when there's no water or light)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to consistently distinguish between effects of missing water versus missing light, often interchangeably using signs of poor growth (e.g., wilting in both scenarios).",
    "The student may depict water and light effects but cannot clearly identify or label the specific differences caused by each absence (student may confuse the effects or think they are the same).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate comprehensive differences in plant growth stages when water or light is missing (e.g., might not show stunted growth or yellowing leaves clearly)."
