  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two plants to show what happens with and without sunlight and water. I'll start by drawing a plant with both water and light. I'll give it slightly bigger leaves because I know plants need water and sunlight to grow well, but I'm not sure about adding other details that make it look very healthy. Next, I'll draw a plant without water. I remember that without water, plants can look droopy. So I'll make this plant look like it's wilting a bit, maybe having it lean over. Then, I'll draw a plant without sunlight. I think plants need sunlight to grow up straight, so I'll draw this one growing a bit sideways and with smaller leaves. I’m going to keep the plants simple because I still mix up what exactly happens when they miss water versus light. I might even make the droopy plant look a bit similar to the one missing sunlight because that's a bit confusing to keep separate. I'll use simple colors like green for leaves and brown for drooping parts. I can show fewer leaves where water and light are missing.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three simple plants: one healthy plant with both water and sunlight having slightly bigger green leaves, one plant without water drooping to the side with smaller, brown-tipped leaves, and one plant without sunlight leaning sideways with small green leaves. Use simple colors and a pencil or crayon style, reflecting a developing understanding of plant health.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by including plants with slightly bigger leaves for healthy ones, indicating some understanding of growth. It includes wilting and sideways growth for plants without water and sunlight, addressing the student’s partial recognition of these needs. The prompt also incorporates the student's struggle to differentiate clearly between the effects of light and water shortages, as both plants are simpler and show overlapping signs of poor health."
