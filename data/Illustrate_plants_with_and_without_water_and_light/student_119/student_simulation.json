  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll draw a plant on the paper. I know plants are usually green, so I'll use the green crayon. I'll try to make it look like a plant, but sometimes my drawing looks more like a scribble. I remember that plants need water and light to live, so I'll draw a big yellow sun over the plant because that looks nice. For water, maybe I should add some blue lines, but I'm not sure where to put them, maybe below the plant. I'm drawing another plant too, but I can't really think of how it will look different without water or light. I guess it will still be green like the first one, and maybe I'll put a sun above it too since they both look happier that way. I don't know how to show that one plant doesn't have what it needs, so both my plants might look similar even if they're not supposed to.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two similar green plants with simple shapes. Both plants have a yellow sun above them. The plants are roughly the same size and shape. The child uses simple green scribbles to form the plants and blue scribbles to suggest water. The style is playful and naive, typical of a young child at the beginning learning level, with similar bright colors used throughout the image.",
  "Explaination": "The image reflects the student's ability to understand that plants are green and associated with the sun, aligning with their ability to attempt drawing a plant with water and light through simple shapes and colors. However, it also illustrates their struggle to differentiate between conditions as both plants appear nearly identical, regardless of access to water and light, which matches their lack of understanding of the effects of environmental resources on plant health."
