  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly distinguish between plants with and without water or light (e.g., all plants look similar regardless of conditions).",
    "The student misunderstands the effects of no water or light on plants (e.g., draws happy faces next to all plants or draws all plants smiling despite environmental conditions).",
    "The student cannot clearly illustrate the difference between a healthy plant and those lacking water or light (e.g., plants are consistently the same size and shape).",
    "The student cannot represent patterns or needs of plants to live and grow (e.g., they may not connect water and light to a plant's health at all)."
