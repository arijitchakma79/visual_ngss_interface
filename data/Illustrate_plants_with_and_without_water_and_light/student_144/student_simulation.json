  "Reasoning": "I remember that plants need both water and light to grow well. First, I'll draw a healthy plant with green leaves, and I'll add a big sun above it because I remember sunlight is important. I'll put some blue lines near the roots to show water since healthy plants need water too. Now for a plant without water, I'll draw another plant with leaves that are a little droopy because I think that's what happens without water. But I'm not sure if itâ€™s right or if they're droopy enough. For a plant without light, I'll draw another plant that looks a little dull in color. I'm thinking maybe flowers should be closed, but I'm not really sure how to show that clearly. I get confused about how different they really should look compared to the healthy one.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing depicting three plants side by side: the first plant is healthy with bright green leaves and a big sun shining above, with blue lines representing water near the roots; the second plant shows some droopy leaves in an attempt to depict a plant without water, but otherwise looks similar; the third plant has duller colors and closed flowers to represent a plant without light, but this might not be clearly distinctive. The style is childlike with bold colors and simple shapes, focusing on basic elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's level as it includes a healthy plant with basic representations of sunlight and water, showing emerging understanding. The second plant shows an attempt to depict water deprivation with drooping leaves, but likely lacks accurate detail. The third plant without light contains features like dull colors and closed flowers but may not exhibit clear differences from the healthy plant, highlighting the student's misunderstanding of significant changes needed to represent a plant lacking light."
