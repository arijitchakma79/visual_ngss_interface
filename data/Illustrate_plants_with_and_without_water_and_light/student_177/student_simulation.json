  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two sets of plants to show the differences between them. First, I’ll draw the healthy plant that has plenty of water and light. I remember that these plants look vibrant, so I’ll use bright green for the leaves and make sure they are standing upright. Then, I’ll move on to the wilting plant without enough water. I’ve seen plants like this have droopy leaves, so I’ll illustrate that and add some brown edges to show they are unhealthy. Next, I’ll draw a plant that’s in the dark. I think these plants don’t grow well and have yellowish leaves, so I’ll use lighter yellow color to show this lack of health. I need to make sure the difference between each plant is clear, so I will put them side by side. I know I sometimes forget to label every part, but as long as the visual distinctions are strong, it should be okay. Let’s not take too much time adding every small detail, the main focus is on the condition of each plant.",
  "Prompt": "A split-panel illustration with realistic hand-drawn style depicting three condition scenarios of plants: On the left, a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves and upright posture, clearly receiving adequate water and light. In the center, an unhealthy plant with droopy, browning-edged leaves indicating insufficient water. On the right, a plant with pale yellow leaves and little to no growth suggesting a lack of light. The background should be simple to emphasize the plants’ conditions, with color contrasts clearly illustrating the differences.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what I am capable of doing: It clearly shows the healthy and unhealthy plant conditions using visual cues like color and posture differences. By arranging the plants side-by-side, it emphasizes the contrast as required for advanced level demonstration. While I sometimes overlook minor details like labeling, the focus on visual differences matches what I do well, ensuring understanding even if small details are missed."
