  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two pots side-by-side. In the first pot, I’ll make sure the plant looks happy and healthy. I remember that plants need water to grow, so I'll add some water droplets near the roots of this plant. Next, I'll draw the sun shining overhead because the plant also needs sunlight. For the second pot, I’ll draw a droopy plant that looks like it's struggling. I know this plant won't have any water, so I’ll leave the ground dry. I'll also try to draw some clouds to show that the sun is blocked, depicting the lack of sunlight. Both pots will have labels to indicate water, sunlight, and absence of them, but sometimes I forget. I need to be careful to try and label everything. The healthy plant in the sun should look bigger and happier, while the drooping plant will look smaller to show it isn’t growing well.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two potted plants. The first pot shows a vibrant, green plant with large leaves, receiving blue water droplets at its base, and has a yellow sun shining above. The second pot depicts a smaller, wilted plant with brownish leaves. The soil around this plant is dry, and gray clouds hover above, blocking the sun. There are labels indicating 'Water' and 'Sunlight' near the healthy plant, while the struggling plant is labeled with 'No Water' and 'No Sunlight'. The scene is drawn in a colorful, cartoonish style with clear distinctions between the healthy and unhealthy plant.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student's abilities to illustrate accurate concepts, such as showing a thriving plant with both sunlight and water and a struggling plant without them. It also reflects the student's potential oversight in labeling, as every element is not guaranteed to be labeled in reality. The drawing style is appropriate for a student at an advanced level but acknowledges the slight inconsistencies or omissions they might have."
