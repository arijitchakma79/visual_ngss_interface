  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm supposed to show plants with and without water and light. I think plants are green, so I'll get my green crayon. I'll draw two plants. First, I'll make a stick and put a circle on top for a leaf or flower. I'll do the same for the other plant. I remember that plants need things to grow, but I'm not sure how they look when they don't get them. For the first plant, I'll use blue and yellow because those are like water and sunlight. The second plant could be sad because it has nothing, so maybe I'll just put a sad face on it. I’m not sure if that’s right, but it shows it’s not as happy without water and light. I have these colors, so I'll use them to show different plants, even if I'm not sure how they change exactly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple cartoon-like image showing two basic plant shapes. On the left, a plant with a stick stem and a green circle on top, colored with green leaves and yellow and blue wavy lines around to show water and sunlight. On the right, another similar plant but with a sad face on the green circle to indicate it's unhappy and lacking something, with no wavy lines representing water or sunlight. Use bright colors and a child-like drawing style with crayons for simplicity.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's attempt to differentiate plants using colors and symbols they associate with water and light, like blue and yellow. The sad face symbolizes the lack of water or light, which is a misunderstanding since they don't alter the plant structure. The prompt captures the effort at this level to show differences in a very basic way while not fully understanding how the absence of essentials affects plant growth."
