    "The student is unlikely to accurately depict the effects of no water or light on a plant's appearance (e.g., drawing a sad face on a plant without changing its structure).",
    "The student may not be able to identify patterns or any correlation between water, light, and plant growth (e.g., drawings lack clear labels or explanation).",
    "The student does not explain or illustrate that plants need both water and light to live, possibly showing them thriving with none (student believes plants can live without essentials).",
