  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a plant. I remember that plants have leaves, so I'll start with some oval shapes to make simple leaves. I know plants are green, so I'll color these leaves in green. I should draw two plants because they asked about with and without water and light. Hmm, I'm not sure how to show that difference exactly. I'll just put a few random scribbles around each plant. Now the soil... they didn't mention it, so I guess I can leave it blank or draw a quick rectangle under the plant for the ground. One plant can have more scribbles around it; maybe that'll help show it's different, but I'm not sure how? I'll make the plant the same in both and color both plants green because that's what plants look like, right? I'm confused about what else to do to show without water and light.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two simple plant outlines side by side. Each plant has a few oval shapes for leaves, colored in green without any details. There are sporadic green scribbles around both plants. The plants sit on plain, blank rectangles meant to represent ground. Use a simple, child-like drawing style with basic shapes and uneven coloring. The plants look the same, with no clear difference in health.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a basic plant shape and color it green, representing their belief that plants are green. It also shows their struggle to depict differences in plant health due to lacking water and light, as both plants look identical. The random scribbles signify an attempt to differentiate, though they don't successfully convey the concepts due to their limited understanding. This aligns with their level description of minimal understanding."
