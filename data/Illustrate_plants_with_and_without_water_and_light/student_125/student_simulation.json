  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw a plant with and without water and light. First, I'll start with the plant. I think a plant looks like a green stick, so I'll draw a line, kind of like a stick. I remember plants are green, so I'll make it green. Then I can put a round top on the stick, like a leaf. Leaves are green too, so I'll color it green as well. I’m not sure how plants change when they don’t have water or light. They should all look like plants, so I’ll draw the same shape again. I’ll just color them the same green because I think all plants should be green. I don’t know how to show anything changing since I don't know what happens when they don't have water or light.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two plants. Both plants are represented as simple green lines with round tops resembling leaves. The color is mostly the same shade of green, showing no significant differences between the two. The style is child-like, basic, and illustrative, using simple shapes and colors. The background is plain with no additional details, focusing solely on the two plant drawings.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including basic shapes like green sticks and round tops as the plants. It reflects the student’s struggle to show differences when plants lack water or light by depicting both plants in the same way, highlighting a lack of understanding of the effects of light and water on plant health. This aligns with what's described in the 'CANNOT' section for the student's level."
