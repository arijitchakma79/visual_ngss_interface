  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant with both water and light. I remember that plants need bright green leaves and a sturdy stem, so I'll draw them with nice wide leaves and a strong, straight stem. There’s a sun shining in the sky and a puddle at the base for water. Next, I will draw a wilted plant that lacks water. I'll make this one with droopy, yellowing leaves and a bent, flimsy stem to show it’s not doing well. Now, I’ll depict a plant without enough light. I know it shouldn't look too bright and maybe a bit stretched out, trying to reach for some light. So, its leaves will be pale and small with a tall and thin stem. I'm adding arrows to indicate missing or present light and water and labeling each part like the roots, stem, and leaves. I’ll try not to make the effects too dramatic even though it could be easy to show them dying distinctly. I'll make sure to put detailed labels like 'water', 'sunlight', 'healthy plant', and 'wilted plant'. I sometimes forget small details, like the color of the soil, but I know the main parts are correct.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a set of three side-by-side plant drawings. The first plant is upright and healthy with green, broad leaves, a strong stem, vibrant in color, under a bright sun with a small water puddle beneath. The second plant is wilted, showing droopy yellow leaves and a bent, weak stem, placed under a duller sky with no water source. The third plant has a long, spindly stem with small, pale leaves, stretching slightly towards a dim light source. Include arrows pointing from the sun and water source for the healthy plant and labels: 'Healthy with Light and Water', 'Wilted without Water', 'Stretched without Light'. Use colored pencils for added detail. Remember to incorporate different shades of green, yellow, and brown to indicate various states of the plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to demonstrate the differences between healthy and distressed plants through their understanding of water and light's effects. The prompt includes detailed descriptions and labeling to align with the student's level, showing a complete representation of each plant scenario. Minor omissions or over-simplifications are acknowledged but do not detract from the accurate depiction aimed for in the task."
