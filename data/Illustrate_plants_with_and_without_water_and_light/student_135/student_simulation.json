  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two pots. First, I’ll draw a plant with water and light. I remember that a healthy plant stands upright, so I'll draw the stem going straight up with a few leaves. The leaves won’t be super detailed, but they'll be green to show they’re healthy. Now for the second plant, without water. I think I’ve seen plants wilt when they are thirsty, so I'll draw the stem leaning to one side with floppy leaves. I’m not too sure what happens to a plant if it doesn’t get light, but I think it might just be a bit droopy. I remember sometimes to label, so I’ll write 'Healthy' and 'Thirsty' beside each plant, but I might forget to label them both. I’m not sure about drawing yellowing or browning leaves because I don’t really remember what they look like, so I’ll just focus on the wilting.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two potted plants side by side. The first plant should have a green, upright stem with simple green leaves to indicate it’s healthy with water and light. The second plant should have a slanted stem and floppy leaves, showing signs of wilting from lack of water. Label the first plant ‘Healthy’ and the second plant ‘Thirsty’. Use simple colors like green and brown for the plants and pots, and a basic, slightly messy hand-drawn style to reflect an emerging understanding of a developing student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict basic differences between plants with and without water, like upright versus drooping stems. It doesn’t include advanced symptoms like leaf yellowing or browning due to lack of light, aligning with the student's misunderstandings. The use of labels, 'Healthy' and 'Thirsty', is included as the student sometimes remembers to use them, though not consistently."
