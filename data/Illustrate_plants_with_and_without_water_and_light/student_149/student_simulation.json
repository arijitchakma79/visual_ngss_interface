  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant with plenty of water and light. I remember that plants like this should have green leaves, because green shows they are healthy. I'll draw big, green leaves on my plant. Now, I’ll draw a plant that doesn’t have enough water. I know that when a plant doesn't have enough water, its leaves can droop, so I’ll make these leaves droopy. For the plant without light, I think it might be a little smaller, so I'll draw it with smaller leaves. I’m not sure if there's a difference between lack of water and light, so I might draw these issues a bit too similarly. My plants might not have clear differences between them, and the smaller details of what makes them 'healthy' might not be very clear.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration of three plants. The first plant on the left has large green leaves, symbolizing health with plenty of water and light. The second plant in the middle has drooping, slightly brownish leaves, showing lack of water. The third plant on the right is smaller with slightly paler green leaves, attempting to show limited light. The style is simple and cartoonish, using colored pencils with an emphasis on green, brown, and slightly lighter shades of green.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate a plant with sufficient water and light well, by focusing on green leaves. They also can partially show the effects of drought by including drooping leaves. However, the prompt captures the student's struggle to differentiate clearly between the effects of water and light shortages, potentially making both look similar. These plants stress water-related issues over light-related ones, indicating incomplete understanding, in line with the student's limitations."
