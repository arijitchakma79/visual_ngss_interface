  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a simple picture of a plant that resembles basic plant shape, but with no clear indication of whether it is growing, wilting, or healthy.",
    "The student might attempt to draw a sun or a puddle as symbols of light or water but without clarity on their placement or relevance to plant health."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to consistently show the difference between a plant with enough water and light and one without (may draw both plants looking the same).",
    "The student may not label their drawing or use labels incorrectly (e.g., label a sun as water).",
    "The student cannot use their illustration to explain why plants need water and light (may include both elements without showing cause and effect).",
    "The student struggles to show clear patterns in plant response to changes in water and light (e.g., both plants drawn upright regardless of conditions).",
    "The student may misunderstand the task, thinking that the focus is on drawing a pretty plant rather than showing different conditions (e.g., focuses on decorative elements)."
