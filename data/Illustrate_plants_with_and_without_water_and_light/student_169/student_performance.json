  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant that has plenty of water and light, showing it looking healthy and growing well.",
    "The student can draw a plant that does not have enough water, showing it looking wilted or dry.",
    "The student can draw a plant that does not have enough light, showing it looking weak or not growing well.",
    "The student can use their drawings to show the pattern that plants need both water and light to live and grow, but inconsistently apply this understanding across all examples."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit specific details, such as the source of light or the appearance of soil moisture, leading to slightly unclear representation.",
    "The student might not fully explain through their drawings the nuanced differences between plants lacking water versus light (e.g., one drawing might suggest the plant is both wilted and weak without clarifying distinct causes)."
