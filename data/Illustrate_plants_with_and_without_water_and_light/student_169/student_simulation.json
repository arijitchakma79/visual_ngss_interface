  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant with plenty of water and light. I remember that plants like being green and tall when they get what they need, so I'll draw this plant with bright green leaves and some flowers to show it's growing well. Next, I need to draw a plant without enough water. I think this plant will look wilted, so I'll draw it with drooping, brownish leaves. Now, for the plant without enough light, I know it should look weak or not growing well, so I'll draw it with pale, yellowish leaves. Maybe the stem is leaning or not straight, but I might make it look too similar to the wilted plant because I'm not sure how to show the difference clearly. I'll add a sun in the drawings where there's enough light and maybe blue drops around the healthy plant for water, but I might forget where to put these details exactly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with three plants. The first plant is healthy, with bright green leaves and colorful flowers, standing tall under a yellow sun in the sky, and the ground looks moist. The second plant appears wilted, with brownish, drooping leaves and dry soil beneath it under a gray sky. The third plant looks weak with pale, yellowish leaves and a leaning stem, also under a gray sky. The drawing style should appear as a childâ€™s illustration with crayon-style textures and vivid colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes a healthy plant that is thriving with water and sunlight, drawn with clear and bright colors to show health. The plant lacking water appears wilted and dry, demonstrating the student's understanding of this state. The plant without light is shown as weak, though the specific distinction between lacking light and water might not be perfectly clear, reflecting the student's challenge in fully differentiating these conditions."
