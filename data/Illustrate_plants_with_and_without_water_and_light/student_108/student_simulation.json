  "Reasoning": "I am going to draw a plant. First, I'll draw a straight line for the stem and then some leaves. I think plants have leaves. Now, I'll draw a sun in the top corner because I see suns in pictures of plants sometimes. I'm not sure how to show that the plant needs water, so maybe I'll just draw drops of water randomly around the plant. I don't know how to show the plant without water and light, so both sides will look the same because I think plants just grow. I think I'm done.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing showing a plant with a straight green stem and a few leaves. In the top corner, there's a bright yellow sun drawn with radiating lines. Water droplets are scattered around, with no specific direction or source. There is no noticeable difference between healthy or unhealthy plants. The style is simplistic and resembles a beginner's coloring book image.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects that the student can draw basic plant elements like a stem and leaves, as well as attempt to include a sun and water. However, it lacks detail, context, and the depiction of cause-effect relationships, such as showing a plant thriving with water and sunlight or wilting without it. The placement of elements is random, and there is no visualization of the needs of plants or patterns that distinguish healthy from unhealthy plants, aligning with the student's understanding level."
