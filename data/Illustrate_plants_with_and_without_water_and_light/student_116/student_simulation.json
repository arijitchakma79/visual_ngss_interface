  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw plants with and without water and light. I think plants need water and light to be green and happy, but I'm not sure how to show that. I'll start by drawing a plant on the left side. I'll make it a simple shape, like an oval on top of a stick for the stem. Maybe I'll add a few leaves, but I'm not good at making them look detailed. I'll use green because that's how most plants look in pictures. Now I should draw another plant without water or light, but I'm not sure how to make it look different. I'll draw the same shape on the right side. I think I'll try to draw a cloud above one of the plants to show rain, but I'm not sure which one. I might forget to add the sun because I'm not sure how to put it in the drawing. For labels, I'll write 'Happy Plant' next to one and 'Sad Plant' for the other, but I don't remember which one needs the water or sun. I guess they both look the same because I didn't change anything to show they are struggling.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants side by side. Each plant is represented by an oval on top of a vertical line for the stem, with a few basic leaves. Use green for the plant color. Above one of the plants is a cloud symbolizing rain. There is no differentiation in plant health; both look identical. Labels read 'Happy Plant' and 'Sad Plant' underneath each drawing. The style is cartoonish and simple without much detail or variation.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including basic plant shapes and some symbolic elements like a cloud, although the connection between rain and plant health is not clear. The student struggles with showing health differences between plants, making both plants look similar despite attempted labeling, which aligns with their confusion about how water or light affects plant appearance. The drawing reflects minimal understanding, as required."
