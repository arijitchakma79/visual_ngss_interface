  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draws vague plant shapes that could represent plants in various conditions (plant shapes present but not detailed).",
    "Uses some colors or elements like sun or rain symbolically, though inconsistently (attempts symbols but may not link them to plant health)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Fails to clearly differentiate between plants with and without water or light (drawings look similar regardless of condition).",
    "Does not illustrate plants as healthy or struggling based on water or light presence (all plants look similar or lack clear health indicators like green leaves or drooping stems).",
    "Omits labeling or uses labels incorrectly, such as calling a plant 'happy' or 'sad' instead of indicating water/light presence (labels do not reflect plant needs).",
    "Misunderstands or overlooks changes in plant appearance due to lack of water or light, showing no awareness of withering or struggling (all plants look alive and thriving without distinction).",
    "Makes attempt to include observations or examples but with irrelevance or confusion (draws unrelated objects or scenes without connecting them to plants)."
