  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two plants: one with enough water and light, and one without. I'll start by drawing the healthy plant. I remember that a healthy plant has bright green leaves and firm stems, so I'll make sure the leaves are big and a nice, vivid green color. I'll draw the stems straight to show they're strong. Now, for the wilting plant, I'll make the leaves droopy like they're sad, and for the plant without light, I'll color the leaves a pale or yellowish color. I'll label the healthy plant's parts first; I'll write 'stems' and 'leaves'. Oops, I forgot to label 'roots' earlier! I hope I remember it on the wilting plant. I'll try to show a wilting plant pattern but sometimes I think I make them look similar, so I need to focus on making the leaves droop more. I'll make the stems a bit bent for the wilting one as well.",
  "Prompt": "Sketch of two plants: on the left, a healthy plant with bright green leaves and firm, upright stems. Parts are labeled as 'stems' and 'leaves'. The plant is well-watered and well-lit, indicated by the vivid green color. On the right, a plant showing the effects of lacking light with pale, yellowish leaves. Some leaves droop to signal wilting, along with bent stems that indicate lack of water. Labels might be missing, but parts such as 'stems' are depicted. The drawing is simple with hand-drawn quality, emphasizing basic shapes and vivid colors for healthy plant, and muted tones for the wilting one.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately depict healthy plants with bright colors and strong structure while showing an understanding of wilting and color changes when plants lack water or light. The missing or inconsistent labels reflect the student's struggle with labeling all parts correctly, and the drawing effort aligns with their proficiency level: capturing core ideas but with minor inconsistencies in labeling or pattern depiction."
