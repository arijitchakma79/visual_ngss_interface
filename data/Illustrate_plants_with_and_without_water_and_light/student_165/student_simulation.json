  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant with plenty of water and light. I remember that healthy plants have strong green leaves and a sturdy stem. I'll also draw the roots to show where the plant drinks water. Next, I'll draw another plant but this time without any water. I think it should have droopy leaves and a limp stem to show it's not growing well. Now, I'll draw a plant without any light. It should look similar to the one without water, maybe with some yellowing leaves. I remember to label the leaves and roots, since they help the plant take in water and light. I'll try to show that the plant needs both things to be healthy, but I might not be able to show big differences between not having water and not having light. I should make sure the leaves and roots are in the drawings, even if I forget some other parts like flowers or stamens.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three plants side by side in a simple, child-like style. The first plant is healthy with green leaves, a sturdy stem, and visible roots; add sunshine above it to show it has light, and make the soil look moist to show it has water. The second plant has droopy, limp leaves and a bent stem to indicate it lacks water; depict dry soil beneath it. The third plant is in dim lighting, its leaves slightly yellowing and wilting, suggesting a lack of light; the soil is normal, but there's no sunshine above. Label the main parts like 'leaves', 'stem', and 'roots' on each plant.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt focuses on the student's ability to draw key plant responses to having water and light vs. lacking these. It highlights the CANs like depicting a healthy plant accurately and labeling key parts, but also shows the CANNOTs, such as not dramatizing the differences between no water and no light greatly. By placing them side by side, it helps illustrate the subtle differences in wilting, despite some potential oversimplification."
