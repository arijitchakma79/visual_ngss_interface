  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing two distinct sections on the page. On the left side, I'll draw a healthy plant. I'll make sure this plant has big, green leaves and a sturdy stem. I'll draw the sun in the sky to indicate there is enough light, and I'll add a watering can or droplets near the soil to show the plant has plenty of water. Moving on to the right side, I'll draw another plant that looks weak. This plant will have drooping leaves to show it lacks water. I'll remember to draw it under grey clouds to suggest limited sunlight. Next, I'll draw another plant in the same area with small, pale leaves to show it isn't getting enough light. I might accidentally forget to indicate where the light is coming from or mislabel something, like calling the leaves 'roots,' if I'm not careful. Finally, I'll add arrows or labels to clearly show which plants are which, but sometimes I might not be consistent with how wilted the poor plants look compared to how healthy I intended to depict the thriving one.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing with two sections: On the left, a thriving plant with big, green leaves and a sturdy stem. Include a sun in the top corner and water droplets near the soil. On the right, two weak plants: one with drooping leaves under grey clouds and another with small, pale leaves, both illustrating lack of water and light. Use a colorful and child-like crayon style with some labels, even if slightly incorrect, like 'roots' mislabeled on leaves.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by clearly dividing the healthy and unhealthy plants and showing the necessary elements like water and sunlight for the healthy plant. It also depicts the struggle accurately with light and water scarcity. The realistic student-level effort shows in potential label mistakes and small inconsistencies in condition severity, making it a proficient yet genuine attempt."
