  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant that looks healthy with basic features such as upright stems and simple green leaves (indicating enough water and light).",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently differentiate between the causes of unhealthy plants (i.e., lack of water vs. lack of light) (student might draw one but not the other).",
    "The student might struggle to illustrate specific differences like color changes, focusing primarily on wilting instead.",
    "The student might not clearly identify the pattern between plant health and water/light needs, possibly omitting one of these elements (student understands that plants need certain things but not all together)."
