  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant that looks healthy. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves and upright stems, so I'll sketch that first. The leaves are simple shapes because remembering the details is tricky. Now, for the unhealthy plant, I know if it's unhealthy it might have drooping leaves. I’ll draw that too, but it's harder to remember what makes them droop exactly. I think maybe they droop because of not enough water, but I’m not sure what they look like without enough light. I’ll draw some plants drooping differently. One has yellowish leaves because I remember hearing that color change can happen but can't think of specifics. I'll draw some with brown edges and some with just wilting leaves. I’ll focus mainly on the wilting and droopy parts because that stands out to me the most when plants are not healthy.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants side by side on unlined paper. The healthy plant on the left is depicted with an upright stem and simple, bright green leaves. The unhealthy plant on the right has drooping, slightly wilted leaves. Some leaves are brown at the edges, and a few are yellowish, while others are just wilted. Overall, the drawing uses basic shapes and colors, indicating an elementary understanding. The style is childlike with clear but basic representations of plant features.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic features of a healthy plant, like green leaves and upright stems. The unhealthy plant is drawn with drooping leaves and some attempts at depicting distress through color changes, like brown edges. However, the student struggles to consistently show differences due to specific deficiencies like lack of water versus light, focusing more on wilting. The task showcases the student's developing understanding."
