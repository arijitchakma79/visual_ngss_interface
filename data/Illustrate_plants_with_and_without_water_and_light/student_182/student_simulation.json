  "Reasoning": "To start, I'll draw a healthy plant. I know it needs plenty of water and light, so I'll sketch vibrant green leaves and strong stems on a plant pot sitting under the sun. I'll add a yellow sun to indicate light and maybe a small watering can to show it's getting enough water. For the unhealthy plant without water, I should draw it with drooping, wilted leaves and a slack posture. I'll label it with 'no water' to make it clear. Next, for the plant without light, I'll sketch it with pale or faded leaves and maybe a few yellow spots to indicate poor light exposure. I'll label it with 'no light'. To compare, I'll draw parallels, like how the healthy plant has green, upright leaves, while the other two examples show signs of stress. Lastly, I'll add a diagram or symbol showing where plants can grow with enough water and light, perhaps a plant happily in the sun, and those that can't, like an 'X' over a shaded or dry area. Oops, I might forget to label everything precisely, but I know my main goal is showing the effects of water and light on plants.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing that illustrates the following elements: A healthy plant in vibrant green with strong growth, placed under a bright yellow sun with a small blue watering can nearby. Show an unhealthy plant without water featuring drooping leaves and soft stems labeled 'no water'. Include another unhealthy plant with pale, yellowing leaves labeled 'no light'. Add comparisons showing these contrasts, such as an arrow pointing from the healthy plant to the others to indicate their conditions. Use bright colors for the healthy illustration and somber colors like faded greens and yellows for the unhealthy ones. Draw in a children's hand-drawn style, using evident labels and visual depictions of suitable and unsuitable growing conditions for clarity.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes vibrant green, healthy plant illustrations and labels to denote water and light sources, demonstrating robust understanding. It also asks for illustrations of unhealthy plants to show the effects of lacking water and light. The student might struggle with consistent labeling or minor element placement but overall can represent the task accurately, aligning with their advanced level description."
