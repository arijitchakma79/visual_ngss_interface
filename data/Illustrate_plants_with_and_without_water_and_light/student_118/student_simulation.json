  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a plant first. I remember that plants have a stem and leaves, so I’ll draw a simple green plant with some leaves. Now, I should think about the environment. I know the sun is important, so I’ll draw a big, yellow sun in the sky. I also know water is important. I’ll add some blue raindrops falling from the sky. I think that’s enough to show the plant growing. Now, I need to show another plant, but I’m not really sure how to make it look different if it doesn’t have water. I’ll just draw it the same way because I think both plants should have stems and leaves. For the second plant, I'll put it in a different place, but I’m not sure how to show it doesn't get sun, so I won’t include anything else. I also think I’ll put some animals in the drawing because they are in nature too.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two simple plants with green stems and leaves. Above one plant is a big yellow sun and big blue raindrops. Both plants look almost identical, with no signs of wilting or damage. There are extra elements like cartoonish animals scattered around, unrelated to the plant’s needs. The drawing is colorful with bold crayon strokes and lacks depth or realism.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can and cannot do by including a simplistic representation of a plant without differentiating between a well-nourished and a deprived plant. The student draws an environmental factor, like the sun and raindrops, but fails to manipulate these to illustrate plant needs effectively; both plants look the same regardless of water or light presence. Additional, unrelated elements such as animals reflect misunderstandings of the task requirements."
