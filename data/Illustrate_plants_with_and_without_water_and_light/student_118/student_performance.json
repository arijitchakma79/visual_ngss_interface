  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show the effects of the absence of water on plants (e.g., both plants may look identical even if one is without water).",
    "The student is unlikely to represent the concept that light affects plant growth (e.g., the drawing may not include light at all or its effect may not be shown).",
    "The student cannot effectively illustrate the presence or absence of plants in different environments like shaded areas (e.g., the student may ignore differences in settings).",
    "The student may misunderstand basic needs of plants and illustrate them using unrelated images (e.g., drawing animals or objects instead of focusing on plant-specific needs)."
