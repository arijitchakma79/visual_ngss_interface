  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing two sections on my paper: one for plants getting water and light and the other for plants lacking these conditions. On the left side, I’ll draw a healthy plant because it gets water and light. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves and a strong, upright stem, so I'll draw lots of green leaves and a sturdy brown stem. I'll use a bright green for fresh leaves. Next, I'll write labels like 'water' and 'sunlight' with arrows pointing to this plant to show what it’s receiving. Now, on the right side of the page, I need to illustrate a plant without water. I'll draw this plant with drooping leaves to show it's not healthy. I'll make the leaves a dull green to show they're wilting. Below that, I'll draw another plant without light. I'll remember to draw the leaves fewer in number and yellowish to indicate it's not healthy because of the lack of sunlight. I'll illustrate the ground under both plants with brown to show the soil. I might forget to label one of these plants or not fully color in a leaf, but I'll do my best to capture how a plant struggles without water or light by using different colors to show their conditions.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of two sections showing plants. On the left, draw a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves and a strong brown stem, labeled with arrows indicating 'water' and 'sunlight'. On the right, draw two plants: one with drooping, dull green leaves for lack of water, and another with fewer, yellow leaves representing lack of light. The soil should be brown. Include detailed colors: bright green for healthy leaves, dull green and yellow for unhealthy ones, ensuring one plant may have a minor mislabel or some incomplete leaf coloring. The style should be sketch-like, resembling a student's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as it captures the advanced skill of drawing plants accurately according to their conditions and using labels and colors effectively. However, it also accounts for minor oversights like missing labels or incomplete coloring, which aligns with the student occasionally overlooking a minor detail."
