  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant. I know that a healthy plant has strong, green leaves, so I'll make sure the leaves are vibrant green and standing upright. I remember this happens when the plant gets enough water and light. Next to it, I'll draw a plant lacking water. I'll make the leaves look droopy or a bit curled up as if they are dry. For the plant lacking light, I'll color the leaves a pale green or yellowish to show that they're not healthy. I'll make sure to show the plants side by side so it's easy to see the differences. I realize I might forget to label the pale leaves specifically as 'pale' due to not always remembering subtle details. I'll try to capture patterns like how all the leaves look consistently affected, even if I focus mostly on the leaves instead of other signs like root issues.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three potted plants side by side. The first is a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves, standing upright, indicating it's getting enough water and light. The second plant has drooping, slightly curled leaves that look dry, showcasing a lack of water. The third plant has pale, slightly wilted leaves, showing its lack of light. Use clear, simple lines and bright colors for the healthy plant, with duller tones for the struggling plants. Present it in a clear, easy-to-understand style suitable for an educational illustration.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes a healthy plant, capturing the student's ability to represent what a well-cared-for plant looks like. It also includes detailed differences for water and light deficiency, focusing on leaves, which aligns with the student's strengths. The prompt omits finer labels of specific leaf conditions, reflecting the student's tendency to overlook minor details, like labeling pale leaves. The focus remains on visible, clear changes mainly in the leaves rather than roots, matching the student's patterns of attention and typical areas of omission."
