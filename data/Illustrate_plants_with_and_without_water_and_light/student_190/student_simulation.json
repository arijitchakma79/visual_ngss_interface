  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two pots of plants because I remember that each one needs to show different conditions. For the healthy plant, I’ll draw it tall and green with lots of leaves, since it has enough water and sunlight. I’ll show some soil in the pot. For the stressed plant without water, I’ll draw it looking bent or wilted with droopy leaves to show it’s not healthy. The soil will look dry, cracked even, because it lacks water. For the other plant without light, I’ll depict it with yellowing leaves and a very thin, stretched stem, like it’s reaching for light. I might not get every exact part labeled, but I’ll try to add 'dry soil' and 'wilting leaves' annotations here and there. I’ll label where I can to show I've understood the concepts. If I have time, I’ll add the sun and a rain cloud above the healthy plant to show what it needs.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side pots each with a plant. The left pot contains a healthy green plant with lush leaves and moist soil, under a shining sun and a small rain cloud symbolizing adequate sunlight and water. The right pot contains a drooping plant with yellowing leaves and a thin stem that appears stretched, its soil is dry and cracked, showing insufficient water and light. Include simple labels like 'moist soil', 'dry soil', 'wilting leaves', and 'healthy leaves'. Use a child-like drawing style with bright colors to depict a garden scene.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by illustrating healthy and stressed plants differently according to water and light availability, highlighting the essential needs for growth. It acknowledges the student's ability to use visual patterns and basic labels to convey scientific concepts, but also accounts for their minor struggles, such as possibly inconsistent or partial labeling."
