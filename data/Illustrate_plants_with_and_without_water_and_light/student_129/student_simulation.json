  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant with water and light. I know plants need water and light to grow well. I’ll draw a tall plant with big green leaves because that's what I see in healthy plants. I remember that water helps plants grow taller, and the light gives energy, so my plant should look healthy. Now, I'll draw a plant without water. Plants wilt without water, so I’ll draw it droopy, but I might make it still somewhat green as I often see plants as green if they are alive. Without water, it might get smaller, but I don't think about it changing color much. Next, I'll draw a plant without light. I'll show it with less growth, maybe it's a little wilted too, but I might forget to change the color of the leaves much. I know light helps with growth, but I see plants stay green so I’ll keep it that way.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three side-by-side plant illustrations: The first plant, with water and light, is tall and somewhat lush with medium green leaves, showing moderate health. The second plant, without water, appears slightly smaller and is wilting, but the leaves are still predominantly green. The third plant, without light, is less healthy, showing minor drooping but maintains a green color. Use a simple pencil drawing style with some basic coloring for a developing level of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities and misunderstandings by portraying a plant with average health under optimal conditions, and wilting but still green plants when water or light is lacking. The student struggles to depict color changes, which is reflected in the persistence of green hues across the drawings, even when conditions deteriorate."
