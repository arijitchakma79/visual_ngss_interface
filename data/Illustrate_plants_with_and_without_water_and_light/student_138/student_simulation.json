  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant. I think it needs leaves and a stem, so I'll draw those. I'll add some green leaves and a straight stem to show it's healthy. Next, I'll make sure to draw the sun shining above the plant. I remember plants need light. I'll add some blue water droplets near the roots because plants need water too. Now, for the plant without water. I'll keep the same leaves and stem but make the leaves look droopy. They look like that when they're thirsty, right? I think I got the idea from a picture I saw once. For the plant without light, I'll draw the plant again but this time with a sagging stem to show it's weak. I'll leave out the sun over this plant. I think these show plants without water and light, but I'm not sure if I show all the effects. I'll try my best.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing three plants against a white paper background, one healthy and two in different states of distress. The healthy plant has a straight green stem and vibrant leaves, with a bright yellow sun above and small blue water droplets near the roots. Next to it, a plant without water is depicted with wilted, droopy green leaves but still the same stem. The third plant is without light, showing a sagging stem and slightly less vibrant green leaves. The style is simple, with evident effort but basic details typical of a young student's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's level by showing basic features like healthy stems and leaves but lacking detailed effects on plants without water or light. The student's understanding of plants' needs is present with efforts to include sunlight and water, but the drawings overly simplify these conditions, reflecting emerging understanding. The different states of the plants (healthy, without water, and without light) are shown, though the lack of detail and full accuracy in expressing consequences aligns with the student's tendency to not show a clear difference between no water and no light situations, as well as struggles with full accuracy in labeling and effects."
