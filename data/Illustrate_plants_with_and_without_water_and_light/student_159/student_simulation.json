  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant. I know that a healthy plant has enough water and light, so I'll draw it with nice, upright stems and bright green leaves. I'll include a sun in the sky with rays coming down to show there's plenty of light. For the water, maybe I'll draw some drops near the roots or an arrow pointing to the plant to show it needs water. Next, I'll draw a plant that's not doing well because it doesn't have enough water. I'll make the stems droop and the leaves look wilted to show it needs more water. Now, for the plant that doesn't have enough light, I'll draw it with smaller leaves and maybe a pale green color to show it's not as healthy. I think I'll make the sun look dim for this one. Sometimes I mix these up, so I hope the differences are clear. I should label the elements. Oh no, I forgot to label one of them again! I'll just add labels to the healthy one: 'Water' near the drops and 'Light' near the sun. I should have done that for all of them.",
  "Prompt": "A colored drawing showing three plants on a sunny day. On the left, a healthy plant has upright stems and bright green leaves, with a sun in the sky and water drops near its roots. In the center, a plant with drooping stems and wilted leaves, indicating lack of water, with no water drops but still a sun in the sky. On the right, a plant with smaller, pale leaves, with a dim sun symbolizing insufficient light. The drawing is labeled only for the healthy plant with 'Water' and 'Light', using a colored pencil style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label a healthy plant with enough water and light, using symbols like the sun and water drops. It shows drooping and wilting due to a lack of water, smaller and paler leaves indicating insufficient light â€” though sometimes confused. The forgetting to label some elements reflects where the student struggles."
