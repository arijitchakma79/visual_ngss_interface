  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant that has plenty of water and light. I remember that plants need both to stay healthy, so I will draw a plant with big, green leaves and maybe some flowers too. I will use green for the leaves, brown for the stem, and maybe a bit of yellow for the sun. I might forget to label all parts of the plant, but I know leaves are important, so I’ll try to label them. Next, I’ll draw a plant without water. I know that without water, plants wilt and the leaves turn brown, so I’ll draw the plant with droopy branches and brown, dry leaves. I have to remember that this plant needs to look sadder. Lastly, I’ll draw a plant without light. Without light, I know that plants don’t grow well, so I’ll show it looking pale with fewer leaves. I might not get the details right, like forgetting to show light with yellow rays or which leaves get labeled, but I’ll try to show the main differences in health when plants don’t have what they need. I’ll make sure to show how the plants look different with my drawings.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting three plants side-by-side on a piece of paper. The first plant is healthy with lush green leaves and a strong brown stem under a yellow sun, showing rays. This plant has some parts labeled, like 'leaves', but not all. The second plant appears wilted with droopy branches and brown leaves, indicating lack of water. The third plant has a pale appearance with sparse, lightly colored leaves and an underdeveloped stem, showing lack of sunlight. The style is crayon or colored pencil, with bright colors for the healthy plant and duller colors for the others.",
  "Explaination": "The image generation prompt reflects the student's ability to show the effect of water and light on plant health through clear and distinct illustrations. The student effectively differentiates between healthy and unhealthy plants using colors and plant conditions but struggles with consistent labeling and associating sunlight with yellow rays. This corresponds with their level of proficiency, highlighting what they can do well while also acknowledging areas of inconsistency, such as details in labeling and color use for sunlight."
