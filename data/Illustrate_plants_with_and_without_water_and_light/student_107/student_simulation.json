  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw a plant. I’ll start with a basic shape, like a tall line for the stem and some oval shapes for the leaves, because I remember that plants have leaves. I think water is important, so I’m going to draw some water droplets nearby, but I’m not sure how this affects the plant. Now, I’ll add a sun in the corner, because I know plants need light, but I’m not sure why or how it helps them. I’ll make one side show the plant with these things, but I don’t really know how a healthy plant should look different because of them, so the plant will look pretty much the same on both sides. Without the water, I should try to show the plant is maybe missing something, but I’m not sure how to show it because I don’t really know what happens if there’s no water. And I’ll also draw a plant without the sun. Overall, I’ll just make everything look kind of similar since I don’t really understand the effects of water and light on plants.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple image of two plants side by side. Both plants have straight stems and several oval-shaped leaves, but they are not clearly healthy or unhealthy; they look mostly the same. Add random water droplets near one plant and draw a sun in the sky, slightly away from it. Use bright, basic colors like green for the plants, blue for the water, and yellow for the sun. The drawing should be in a simple, child-like hand-drawn style.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches what the student can do because it includes basic elements like leaves and symbols for water and light, based on their limited understanding. The student does not associate these elements clearly with plant health, so the plants in the drawing appear practically identical without signs of growth or wilt. The drawing also lacks a clear relationship between resources and plant condition, showcasing the student’s minimal grasp on the effects of water and light on plant health."
