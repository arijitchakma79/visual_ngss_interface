  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to depict the plant as healthy primarily because they may not include signs of growth like flowers or fruits (student doesnâ€™t understand what a healthy plant looks like).",
    "The student's drawing might not clearly show wilting or drying up effects on a plant without enough water (student could miss the effect of water entirely).",
    "The student is unlikely to correctly illustrate the impact of lacking light, such as a weak or poorly growing plant (student may not understand light's role in plant health).",
    "The student is probably unable to use the drawing to identify the necessity of both water and light for plant life and growth (student shows no clear relationship between resources and plant health)."
