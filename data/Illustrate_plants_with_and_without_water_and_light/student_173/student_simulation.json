  "Reasoning": "I’ll first draw a healthy plant to show how it's supposed to look when it gets enough water and light. I remember to draw big, green leaves and maybe even a flower to show it's growing well. I'll draw a brown pot for the plant to sit in. Next, I’m going to draw a plant that doesn’t have enough water. I know that plants without enough water look wilted, so I'll make its leaves droopy and a bit withered. I will use duller green colors for this. Now, I will draw a plant that doesn’t get enough light. I think it might look a bit sickly, so I'll make some of its leaves yellow-ish, but I might also mix in some brown because sick plants can be brown too. I want to show a comparison, so I'll put my healthy plant next to the other two. I remember that I sometimes mix up how to show a plant with just not enough light, but I'll try my best to make it look like it's not growing well without exaggerating. Overall, the healthy plant should look the best, with vivid green colors, and the others should look weaker or different.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three potted plants side by side. The first plant on the left is healthy, with vibrant green leaves and perhaps a small flower, in a brown pot. The middle plant shows signs of wilting, with its leaves droopy and in a dull green color, also in a brown pot. The third plant on the right has some yellow and brownish leaves to indicate poor health, suggesting a lack of light, in a similar pot. The style is simple and colorful, illustrating a clear comparison between a healthy plant with enough water and light, and two others lacking these essentials.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what I can do by showing a clearly healthy plant and plants that suffer due to lack of resources. It highlights that I can show wilted leaves to indicate a lack of water and use discolored leaves to suggest possible light deficiency. It also addresses my struggle by reflecting my difficulty in making a clear depiction of a plant suffering solely from the absence of light, as I might use both yellow and brown leaves without a clear distinction."
