  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw plants and show what happens when they have water and light, and when they don't. I'll start with a healthy plant. I remember that plants have leaves and stems, so I'll draw a nice, big plant with lots of green leaves and a tall stem. For the light, I'll draw a bright yellow sun with rays shining down on the plant, showing that it’s getting light. Now, for the water, I could draw raindrops or a watering can. I’ll try drawing a watering can to show the water coming down. I'll make sure to label the sun and the water so it's clear. Now, on the other half, I need to draw the plant without water and light. The leaves should look wilted or droopy, so I'll make them bend down and look less green. Maybe I’ll forget to label the different elements like the raindrops versus watering can, but I’ll do my best to make it clear. I need to show the causes clearly, but it’s hard to make that obvious in a drawing. I’ll just show the sun missing and no water in this part. It should be clear that these are different because the plant looks sad.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split image to show plants with and without water and light. On the left, illustrate a healthy plant with green leaves and a tall stem. Above it, draw a bright yellow sun with rays shining down. Draw a red watering can pouring water at the plant’s base. On the right side, draw a plant with droopy, wilted leaves that appear less green. Make sure it looks dry with no sun above. Use a realistic style with vivid greens, yellows, and reds contrasting the dull colors on the right.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do as it includes a detailed, accurate drawing of a healthy plant with water and light, using a watering can as a water source and including a sun with sun rays. The student’s level allows them to create realistic details like the bright greens of a healthy plant. For what they might struggle with, the image captures a wilted plant without water or sunlight, and while it attempts to show causation by omitting the sun and water elements, it acknowledges that the student might not consistently label every element accurately, highlighting a slight gap in connecting effects with causes."
