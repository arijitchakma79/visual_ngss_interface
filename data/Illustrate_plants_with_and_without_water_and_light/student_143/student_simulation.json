  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw plants showing the difference between having water and light and not having them. I'll start with a healthy plant. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves, so I’ll draw a plant with lots of green leaves. I think I'll add some sun above it because plants need sunlight. I'll also draw some raindrops; I know water is important too. Now, the wilted plant. I remember they look kind of droopy, so I'll make the leaves hang down a little bit. But I'm not sure how to show it’s different because of no water or light, so I might end up drawing the sun and raindrops here too. I wish I could make it clearer how one is supposed to look different because there’s less light or water.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of two plants side by side. The first plant is healthy with green leaves and has a sun above it and raindrops around, indicating sunlight and water. The second plant has slightly drooping leaves, intended to look wilted, but also has a sun and raindrops present, similar to the healthy plant. The colors are bright greens for the healthy leaves, light greens for the wilting leaves, and a yellow sun with blue raindrops. The drawing style is simple, like a child’s sketch with uneven lines and basic forms.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to draw a basic healthy plant with green leaves, sun, and water elements. However, it also includes the struggle to differentiate it from an unhealthy plant since both have similar symbols, like sun and raindrops, which indicates the student's misunderstanding in clearly representing a lack of water and light. The inclusion of these elements in both drawings shows the inconsistency in representing the impact of these factors on plant health."
