  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic representation of a healthy plant with considerable water and light, though details may be limited (e.g., shows green leaves but lacks detailed structure).",
    "The student may attempt to draw a wilted plant to represent a lack of water, showing some signs of this like drooping leaves, though execution might be inconsistent.",
    "The student can include elements like the sun or raindrops to symbolically show light or water, although the connection might not be explicit."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to consistently represent the differences between healthy and unhealthy plants due to lack of water and light (e.g., both plants might appear similarly drawn with minor changes).",
    "The student may misunderstand the representation of lack of light, possibly showing a sun in all drawings regardless of context (student may not connect sunlight to plant health explicitly).",
    "The student struggles to integrate multiple factors in the drawing, such as simultaneously depicting both water and light necessities (may fail to show the compound effect on plant health)."
