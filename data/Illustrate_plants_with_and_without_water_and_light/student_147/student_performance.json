  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can show in their drawing a plant with upright, green leaves to represent having enough water.",
    "The student can partially show a plant with drooping or wilting leaves to indicate a lack of water, although it may not be distinctly clear.",
    "The student can illustrate a plant with yellowish leaves to suggest a lack of light, but details might be vague or missing.",
    "The student might attempt to show sunlight reaching some plants, indicating they recognize the need for light, though execution may be inconsistent."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unable to clearly differentiate between plants lacking water versus those lacking light, potentially showing similar symptoms for both (e.g., wilting leaves for either situation).",
    "The student does not consistently illustrate the difference in plant appearance between enough and not enough sunlight (student may not fully understand the specific effects of light deprivation on plants).",
    "The student fails to effectively show patterns that indicate plants need both water and light to thrive, possibly because they don't draw a comparison between conditions within the same drawing."
