  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a plant that has enough water. I remember that when a plant is healthy, the leaves are upright and green, so I'll sketch that first. Next, I'll try to draw a plant without enough water. I think the leaves should look droopy or maybe wilting. I'll try to make that clear, but sometimes it's hard to show the difference. Now I'll draw a plant that hasn't had enough light. I think the leaves turn yellow when this happens, so I'll color them yellowish, although I might forget to add some details. Finally, I'll try to show sunlight reaching one of the plants by drawing some sun rays, but I'm not sure if it will look like it's affecting just one plant or all of them. I remember that both water and light are important, but it's difficult for me to clearly show how lack of one versus the other looks different.",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing of three plants. The first plant has upright and green leaves, indicating it is well-watered. The second plant has drooping, slightly wilting leaves, not entirely clear, representing a lack of water. The third plant has yellowish leaves, missing some details, to suggest a lack of light. There are faint, inconsistent sun rays reaching the plants, showing an attempt to represent the need for sunlight. The style is colorful and simple, typical of a developing student's drawing level.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's ability to show a healthy plant with upright, green leaves for sufficient water. It also depicts a plant with droopy leaves for water lack, although the distinction may not be clear. The yellowish leaves for light deprivation are included, despite missing details. The attempt to show sunlight is inconsistent, showing the student's struggle to consistently differentiate the effects of light deprivation and to fully execute this aspect. The drawing is at a developing level, showing basic elements with some emerging understanding."
