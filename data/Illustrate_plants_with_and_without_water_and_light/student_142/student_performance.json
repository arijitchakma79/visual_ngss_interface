  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a plant that appears healthy under conditions of sufficient water and light, but may have limited details or accuracy (e.g., plant is green but lacks distinction between sunlight and water sources).",
    "Draw an unhealthy plant due to lack of water, possibly using withered leaves, but might not differentiate it clearly from a plant lacking light (e.g., wilting plants)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently distinguish differences between plants lacking water versus those lacking light (might show a plant in the dark wilting instead of having yellow leaves).",
    "Illustrate the concept that plants need both water and light to thrive with clarity (could show both water and light present but not effectively link them to plant health).",
    "Accurately depict a plant that looks unhealthy due to a lack of light (may draw a plant that's simply smaller or the same as the healthy one without color change or other details)."
