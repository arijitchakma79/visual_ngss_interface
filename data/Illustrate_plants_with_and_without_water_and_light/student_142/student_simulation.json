  "Reasoning": "I remember that plants need water and light to be healthy. I'll start by drawing a plant that looks healthy. I know the leaves should be green because plants usually look green when they are healthy. I'll draw the sun on top of this plant to show it gets light. I also think water is important, so I'll draw some drops of water around it, like rain. I'm not sure how to make the water and light look like they help the plant, but I'll put them there. For the unhealthy plant, I'll try to show it without water. I think the leaves should be drooping, so I'll draw them hanging down. I should probably make them look dried out too, but I'm not sure how else it'll look different from being without enough light. I guess I'll just make it look sad and wilting because that's what I imagine. I remember plants can look different, but it’s hard to show it when they don’t get light, like maybe they should be yellow or something, but I don't know how. I'll just make it smaller.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing showing two plants side by side. The plant on the left is healthy with green leaves. Above it, there's a bright yellow sun with rays and blue water droplets falling from a small cloud, indicating sufficient light and water. The plant on the right has drooping leaves that appear withered and sad. It looks more dried out and is drawn smaller with darker, softened colors. The background is plain, emphasizing the contrast between plants. The drawing style is child-like with basic elements and vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student's capability to show a healthy plant with green leaves under conditions of water and light, although they don't precisely show them as sources of health. The unhealthy plant is shown wilting due to lack of water with drooping leaves but lacks clear differentiation from lack of light. The student struggles with accurately depicting what happens to plants without sufficient light, as evident by their uncertainty on color changes like yellowing leaves, aligning with their level description."
