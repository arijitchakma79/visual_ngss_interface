  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant that has enough water and light. I’ll make sure to draw vibrant green leaves and a strong upright stem to show it’s healthy. Next, I’ll draw a plant without water. I remember that without water, the plant will have wilted leaves and a drooping stem. It’s important to show the difference between the two, so I’ll make this plant look saggy and sad. Then, I’ll draw another plant that has no light. From what I learned, a plant without light might have pale or yellowing leaves, so I’ll do that here. I sometimes forget to label the sun or water, but I think the drawings will show what I mean about water and light being important. Let me make sure the healthy plant looks different by showing how the leaves are vibrant compared to the pale or wilted ones.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a series of three plants in a child-like, colorful style with crayons and markers. The first plant is healthy, with vibrant green leaves and a strong, upright stem, basking in sunlight with a clear blue sky above and water pooling at the roots. The second plant is water-deprived, with wilted leaves and a drooping stem under the same blue sky with no water at the roots. The third plant lacks light, with pale, yellowed leaves and a stressed appearance, placed under a cloudy sky with no visible sun, but with water at the roots. All plants are in the same patch of soil. Include distinctive colors and a playful drawing style that reflects the student’s advanced understanding but may lack some fine details like labels for sunlight and water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents what students can do by vividly showing the differences in plant health based on water and light. The vibrant healthy plant and the contrasting wilted and pale plants accurately depict the concepts of water and light necessity. Meanwhile, the prompt acknowledges the student's tendencies to omit finer details like specific labeling of sunlight or water, focusing instead on the broader visual distinctions."
