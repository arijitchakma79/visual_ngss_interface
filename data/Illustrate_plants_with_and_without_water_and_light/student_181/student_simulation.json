  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a plant that’s healthy first. I remember that plants need sunlight and water to grow well. I’ll start by drawing a tall, green plant with big leaves. I should add a bright sun in the sky to show the sunlight. To show the water, I’ll draw a watering can with some water droplets falling onto the plant. For the plant without water, I should make it look wilted and sad. I’ll draw the leaves drooping and maybe lighter in color. Next, to show a plant without sunlight, I’ll draw it in the shade. I should make this plant look less vibrant, maybe with smaller leaves. Oh, I should add rain clouds to contrast the sun, but I could forget to label them. I hope my drawings clearly show how important water and light are for plant health.",
  "Prompt": "A split image showing three scenarios of a plant. On the left, a healthy, tall, green plant with large leaves under a bright sun. Beside it, a watering can with droplets of water falling onto the plant, illustrating a well-watered and sunlit environment. In the center, a plant with drooping, lighter-colored leaves, depicted as wilting due to lack of water. On the right, a smaller plant with duller foliage under a dark, cloudy sky, suggesting absence of sunlight. The drawing style is colorful and childlike, capturing an advanced elementary school student’s work. Labels are present on some elements, but not all are clear.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all elements a student at level 4 would understand: healthy plant growth due to water and sunlight and poor plant health due to lack of these. It matches the student's ability to creatively and accurately depict these scenarios, while acknowledging minor labeling issues they might encounter."
