  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two plants side by side to compare them. For the first plant, I'll show it receiving both water and light. I remember that healthy plants are usually a vibrant green, so I'll color this plant with bright green leaves and a tall, sturdy stem. I'll add some raindrop shapes above the plant and a sun shining to indicate it’s getting everything it needs. Next, I'll draw a second plant that doesn't get any water. I'll show it wilting by drawing droopy, sunken leaves, and I'll color them a dull brown to make it look dry. I might forget sometimes to show every detail, so I'll make sure to emphasize the difference in size and color from the healthy plant. For the third plant, I'll show it without light. I remember it might look pale, so I'll color it with light green or yellow leaves and show it not growing as tall. As I draw, I keep in mind that plants need water and light to grow, so my drawings should show this pattern clearly. I’ll label one plant as 'with water and light,’ another as 'without water,’ and the last as 'without light,' but I need to be careful not to forget to label them correctly.",
  "Prompt": "A set of three hand-drawn plants: the first is a vibrant green plant with a tall stem and bright leaves, accompanied by raindrop shapes and a shining sun above. The second plant features droopy, brown leaves to indicate lack of water, appearing wilted and smaller. The third plant has pale yellowish-green leaves, is shorter, and lacks a sun above to show it's without light. Each plant is labeled, but one label might be missing or inconsistent. The style is child-like and colorful, depicting effort but some inconsistency in detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency level by showing clear differences in plant health with and without resources like water and light, which matches the 'can do' part. However, the inclusion of possible missing or inconsistent labels aligns with the 'cannot do' aspect, reflecting a small lapse in detail application. Using a child-like drawing style demonstrates the student's effort and level of understanding."
