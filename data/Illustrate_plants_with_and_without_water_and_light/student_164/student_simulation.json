  "Reasoning": "I'll draw a healthy plant first. I remember that a plant with enough sunlight and water should have bright green leaves and strong, upright stems. I'll draw the plant standing tall with big leaves. Now, I'll show the sunlight by drawing a bright yellow sun in the corner and some bluish raindrops falling from a cloud to show water. Next, I'll draw the unhealthy plant without sunlight. I know that without sunlight, the plant might look wilted, so I'll make the stems droop and the leaves look paler and weaker. For the plant without water, I'll have the leaves droop even more, maybe with brown, drying edges. But I sometimes forget to label the sunlight and water sources. Iâ€™ll try my best but might miss that. Lastly, I need to show the differences clearly. I'll try to make the healthy plant much greener and stand straighter than the other two.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a comparison of three plants. The first plant is healthy, with bright green leaves and strong stems, under a yellow sun and blue raindrops, representing light and water. The second plant, without sunlight, has drooping stems and pale leaves. The third plant, without water, has drooping leaves with brown edges. Use a colorful and illustrative style, highlighting green, yellow, and brown contrasts. Include incomplete labeling with possible missing labels for sunlight and water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency by detailing the visual differences between healthy and unhealthy plants, using color contrast and structural differences like drooping and browning. It also reflects the student's tendency to occasionally forget labels, aligning with the 'CANNOT' aspects of incomplete labeling."
