  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by trying to draw a plant. I think plants have stems and leaves, so I’ll draw a long line for the stem and some big leaves coming out of it. I know the sun is important, so I’ll draw a big circle with lines around it to show the sun in the sky. I might make some wavy lines under the plant to show where the ground is. I think water is drops, so maybe I’ll add some random blue drops around the plant. I'm not sure how to show if a plant is healthy or not, so all my plants will look the same. I remember something about plants needing sunlight and water, but I don't know exactly how to show that affecting the plants. I won't label parts because I'm unsure where things go or what to call them.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a plant with a simple straight stem and a few big, green leaves. Next to the plant, a bright yellow sun with rays is in the sky. There are random blue scribbles around, possibly representing water. The drawing uses basic colors like green for leaves, brown or gray for the stem, and blue for drops. The style is simple and naive, without detail. The plants all look the same, with no obvious differences to show health or issues.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by showcasing their attempt to draw basic plant elements like leaves and a stem, as well as vague representations of sunlight and water without clear connections to the impact on the plant. It reflects their struggle to illustrate the health of the plants or label the parts correctly, consistent with their minimal understanding at level 1."
