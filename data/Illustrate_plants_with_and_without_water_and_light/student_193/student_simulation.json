  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a potted plant that has water and light. I know it should look healthy, so I'll give it bright green leaves and maybe some buds or a flower to show growth. Next, I'll draw another plant without water. I remember it should look sadder, with droopy leaves. I'll use a darker green or grey color to show it's wilting. Then, I'll draw a plant without light. I think it should have pale or yellowing leaves, so I'll color them light yellow. It's important to make clear comparisons to show how the absence of water or light affects the plants. I might forget to label these plant conditions or maybe not show a uniform growth progression in each scenario, because sometimes I miss those details, but I'll do my best to keep the colors and structure right.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three potted plants on a clean, white background. The first plant is healthy with dark, vibrant green leaves and visible new buds, indicating it has water and light. The second plant appears unhealthy due to lack of water, with drooping, wilted leaves in a darker green or grey, conveying dehydration. The third plant is also unhealthy but due to lack of light, with pale yellowing leaves. The drawing should be colorful, with crayons or colored pencils, and detail should be accurate if not perfectly consistent in labeling or growth stages.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw healthy and unhealthy plants with distinct features, with vibrant colors and structural differences showcasing their understanding of how plants need water and light. Yet, it acknowledges minor errors such as potentially forgetting labels or inconsistencies in depicting growth stages across different scenarios, aligning with the student's level and description."
