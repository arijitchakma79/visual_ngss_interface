    "The student can illustrate the appearance of plants that do not receive enough water, showing wilting leaves, drooping stems, and perhaps brown edges to indicate struggling plants.",
    "The student can illustrate the appearance of plants that do not receive enough light by depicting pale or yellowing leaves and elongated stems as symptoms of poor health.",
    "The student can use visual patterns to effectively show the difference in plant health with and without water, using clear contrasts between lush and dry-looking sections.",
    "The student can use visual patterns to effectively show the difference in plant health with and without light, showing shaded areas where plants struggle to thrive.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label all parts due to focus on illustration detail (e.g., a healthy plant might be labeled, but a struggling plant isn't, without affecting overall impact).",
    "The student might experiment with showing additional environment effects but could lack clarity in these extra elements (e.g., adding animals or insects without clear relevance to the topic)."
