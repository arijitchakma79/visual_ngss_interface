  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two sets of plants, one with water and light, and the other without. First, I'll draw the healthy plants. I remember that when plants have enough water and light, they look vibrant and full of life, so I'll use bright greens for the leaves and add some flowers too, maybe in different colors, to show they are thriving. I'll draw the sun and small raindrops above them to show the light and water they need. Next, I'll draw the plants that do not receive enough water. I know they look wilted, so I'll show drooping stems and add brown edges to the leaves. For plants without enough light, I'll have them pale, with yellowish leaves and elongated stems. I want to show the difference clearly, so I'll use lighter colors and make them look a bit stretched. I should label these parts, but I might forget to label everything because I'm focusing on the drawings. I also want to add some atmosphere, like maybe a little bug or animal, but I need to be careful it doesnâ€™t distract from showing how important water and light are.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two groups of plants: the first group is healthy, with bright green leaves and colorful flowers, under a sun and small raindrops in the sky. The second group shows wilted plants with drooping stems and brown-edged leaves, and another section with pale yellow leaves and elongated stems, indicating low light. The drawing uses vibrant and contrasting colors to depict healthy versus struggling plants, and is detailed with both colorful and faded elements. The setting might include unclear additional details like a small animal or insect.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt showcases what the student can illustrate (healthy vs. struggling plants with clear contrasts). It reflects their strength in using color and detail to represent health differences, captures issues like inconsistent labeling (not mentioned in prompt), and includes potential distraction elements like vague environmental additions, consistent with what they struggle with."
