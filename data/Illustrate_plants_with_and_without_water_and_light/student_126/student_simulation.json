  "Reasoning": "First, I'm going to draw a healthy plant. I remember that plants need both water and sunlight to grow well. I'll draw a big, bright sun in the sky and a plant with lots of green leaves and maybe a flower. It looks happy and strong. Next, I want to draw a plant without water. I think plants without water might get droopy, so I'll draw the leaves kind of falling down. The soil looks dry, but I'm not too sure how to show that clearly. Now, I'll draw a plant without sunlight. I think it might look weak, so the leaves won't be very bright. But I know sunlight is important, so maybe I'll just make the plant look smaller. I might forget to make it clear that it's missing sunlight because I'm focusing more on making it look weak.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing three pots with plants. The first pot has a vibrant green plant with many leaves and a small flower, under a bright sun, symbolizing health and growth. The second pot shows a plant with drooping leaves and dry-looking soil, representing a lack of water. The third pot contains a plant with fewer, paler leaves, looking weak, symbolizing a lack of sunlight. The style is simple and cartoonish, using flat colors and clear outlines.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures what the student can do by showing a healthy plant with both water and sunlight, depicted with vibrant colors and a sun. It includes attempts to show a lack of water with drooping leaves and dry soil. The depiction of a plant lacking sunlight is attempted by making it look weak and pale, aligning with the CAN highlights. The student struggles with distinctly separating effects of sunlight and water, as seen by potential confusion or simplicity in portrayal, matching the CANNOT aspects."
