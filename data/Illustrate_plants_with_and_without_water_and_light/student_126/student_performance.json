  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with enough water and sunlight, showing it healthy and may attempt to illustrate it growing with simple elements like leaves or a flower.",
    "The student can attempt to draw a plant without water, possibly depicting it as wilting or drooping, though details might be vague.",
    "The student might illustrate a plant without sunlight and show that it looks weak or not very flourishing, but the illustration might lack clarity on what's missing or why."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may confuse the effects of water and sunlight, potentially swapping the roles (e.g., drawing a plant wilting due to a lack of sunlight rather than water).",
    "The student might not successfully show consistent patterns of how plants differ with and without water and light, occasionally mixing elements from a healthy and unhealthy plant within the same drawing.",
    "The student is likely unable to clearly identify and illustrate that plants need both light and water to live and grow, possibly missing explicit connections or failing to label these needs in the drawing effectively."
