  "Reasoning": "I'm tasked with drawing plants with and without water and light. I'll start by drawing two plants. I remember plants have leaves and a stem, so I'll just use simple shapes for them. Leaves can be ovals and the stem can be a line. For the plant that gets water and light, I'll color it green, because plants are green, right? For the plant without water and light, I'll color it a little differently, maybe a duller color. I'm not sure what changes to make to show that it's unhealthy though, so it might look pretty similar to the healthy one. Maybe I'll just make it a bit smaller. I know plants need water and light, but I don't really know how to show that difference clearly, so I'll just stick to different sizes or colors. I'm not sure about showing drooping or wilting leaves because I don't really understand how that works.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two simple potted plants. The leaves are made of basic oval shapes and the stems are simple lines. The plant on the left is slightly smaller and colored in dull green. The one on the right is colored bright green and is slightly larger. The pots are plain and the background is empty, emphasizing the simplicity of the drawing. The style is child-like with basic shapes, no intricate details or signs of plant stress.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do: using simple shapes for plants and attempting to show a difference mainly through color and size. It also reflects what the student struggles with by not showing plants with clear indications of distress due to lack of water and light, maintaining a simplistic and child-like style without significant details that demonstrate the importance of these elements."
