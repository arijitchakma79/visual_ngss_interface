  "Reasoning": "Okay, I think I’ll start by drawing a simple plant. I know plants are green, so I’ll use a green crayon. I’ll make a round shape with a stem because I think that’s what a plant looks like. I don’t really know how to show water or light, like sunshine, so I’m just going to focus on the plant itself. I can’t really show how the plant might look different if it doesn’t have enough water or light. I’m not sure how to draw leaves looking pale or wilted. Maybe if I just make it green, that’s okay. I’m not adding anything else because I’m not sure what it should look like outside.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a simple, green plant with a round top and single stem. The plant should be drawn using a simple and basic style, focusing mainly on the use of a single green color. There are no additional details like leaves, raindrops, or sunlight. The drawing is minimalistic, appearing almost like a child’s doodle without any environmental context.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's minimal understanding of plants as it includes a simple shape and color, representing what they can do. It avoids environmental elements such as raindrops or sunlight and lacks detailed plant differentiation, reflecting the student's misunderstandings and limitations as described in the CAN and CANNOT sections."
