  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a plant that has both light and water. I remember that this plant should look healthy and growing, with bright green leaves and maybe a budding flower to show it's really thriving. Now, I'll draw a plant that doesn't have water. I know that these plants usually wilt, so I'll make the leaves droopy and maybe a bit brown at the tips to show they’re not healthy. Next, for the plant without light, I remember that it would grow weak, looking tall but kind of pale and thin. I’ll try to show that by giving it long, spindly stems and lighter colored leaves. I need to make sure I clearly label these drawings. For the first one, I'll write 'Plant with Water and Light'. For the second, I'll label it 'Plant without Water', and the third one will be 'Plant without Light'. I might forget one of the labels, but I'll try to label them all correctly. I could accidentally not make the wilting plant look as bad as it would be without water, but I’ll do my best to show the difference. I need to show a clear pattern between the healthy and struggling plants.",
  "Prompt": "Create a colored pencil drawing of three different plants. The first is a healthy, vibrant green plant with lush leaves and a bright, budding flower, labeled 'Plant with Water and Light'. The second plant has droopy, slightly brown leaves, labeled 'Plant without Water'. The third plant appears tall and thin with pale, lighter green leaves, labeled 'Plant without Light'. The style should be childlike and expressive, with simple, clear labels on each plant.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it captures the student's ability to differentiate between healthy and stressed plants based on the presence or absence of water and light. It acknowledges their capability to depict healthy growth and signs of plant distress. The student can label the drawings, although they might forget one label or slightly misrepresent plant stress severity, which could lead to a less dramatic depiction of wilting but still shows effort and understanding at an advanced level."
