  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw two plants to show what happens when they have water and light and when they lack one or both. First, I'll draw a plant that has both water and light. I remember that those plants should look healthy, so I'll draw it with vibrant green leaves and maybe a few colorful flowers to show that it's growing well. The stems will be upright and strong, and I'll add a few deep green leaves to show good health. Next, I'll draw a plant without water. I think it's supposed to look wilted, so I'll make the leaves droopy and not as bright. The stems can look bent or saggy to indicate the plant isnâ€™t doing well. Then, for the plant without light, I know it should have fewer leaves and definitely no flowers, because it can't grow well without sunlight. The leaves should be less green, almost yellowish, maybe a bit spindly looking. I'll draw the roots, but I might forget to show all the tiny root hairs since they're not the main focus. Lastly, I should label the plants to show what's happening. I'll label things like 'healthy plant', 'no water', and 'no light', but I might not label all parts like the stem, even though it's clear what its role is. Overall, my drawings will show how important water and light are for plants to grow.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of three potted plants on a windowsill. The first plant is healthy, with lush green leaves and colorful flowers, representing a plant with water and light. The second plant is wilted, with droopy brownish leaves and sagging stems, representing a plant without water. The third plant is with few yellowed, spindly leaves and no flowers, representing a plant without light. Include labels near each plant: 'Healthy Plant', 'No Water', 'No Light'. The style is colorful and clear, with realistic yet simple details. Ensure vibrant colors for the healthy plant and muted tones for the stressed ones. The drawings should be neat to convey the concepts effectively.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do, such as depicting healthy and unhealthy plant characteristics, using contrasting visuals to show the effects of water and light, and clearly labeling the plant conditions. It respects the student's potential struggles, like minor omissions in root details and incomplete labeling of all plant parts, while highlighting their ability to communicate the main scientific concept effectively."
