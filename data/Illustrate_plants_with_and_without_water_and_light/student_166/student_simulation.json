  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm supposed to draw plants with and without water and light. First, I'll start with the healthy plant. It needs water and light to grow well. I'll draw a tall, strong looking plant with nice green leaves, and I'll make sure to add in a bright yellow sun above it with some blue lines to show water going into the soil. I'll label them 'water' and 'light'. Next, for the plant without water, I'll draw another plant, but this time it looks a bit droopy, like the leaves are falling a bit. I’ll add 'no water' near that one. Finally, for the plant without light, I'll draw it with a dark sky above and some clouds, and the plant looks kind of sad and tilting a bit, just not as perky. I'll label it 'no light'. Sometimes I forget to show how no light affects growth, but I’ll make it clear by showing how sad it looks. I need to make sure to use the right labels so it’s clear why each plant looks different, like adding arrows. I hope I don't mix up the signs or miss any labels.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three cartoon-style plants. The first plant is healthy with bright green leaves, a yellow sun above, and blue water lines going into the soil. Label the sun as 'light' and the water as 'water'. The second plant is drooping with wilted leaves; place 'no water' nearby. The third plant has a dark sky and looks sad with tilting leaves, and label it 'no light'. Make sure each plant is colored accordingly, using greens for healthy and dull colors for wilting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt fits the student's abilities because it includes clear labels like 'water' and 'light', demonstrates their understanding that plants need water and light through visuals, and shows a proficiency level by differentiating between plants with and without these resources. It also reflects the struggles of possibly missing minor differences by perhaps simplifying or not fully detailing the distinct symptoms of missing water versus light."
