  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a healthy plant with water and light, showing it growing well.",
    "The student can draw a plant without water, depicting it wilting or showing signs of stress.",
    "The student can draw a plant without light and show it not growing well or wilting.",
    "The student can identify and label some patterns, such as how plants look different with and without water or light, including labeling basic elements like 'water', 'light', and 'no light'.",
    "The student can illustrate the concept that plants need both water and light to live and grow, possibly using arrows or labels to show the importance of these resources."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label patterns, occasionally missing small details like the degree of wilting when both water and light are absent.",
    "The student may sometimes omit labels like 'no water' or forget to show that lack of water affects growth (may only show wilting without explaining why).",
    "The student may partially illustrate the concept that plants need both water and light, but might not effectively differentiate between the effects of missing water versus missing light (e.g., both plants drawn similarly without specific emphasis on symptoms unique to each).",
    "The student might struggle to consistently show minor elements, such as slight differences between a healthy plant with full water and light versus one with slightly less."
