  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a healthy plant that has plenty of water and light. I remember that leaves should be wide and bright green, and the stem should be upright. Next, I'll draw a plant without water; it should look wilted with drooping leaves and stem. Then, I'll depict a plant without light. I imagine it having pale, possibly yellowing leaves and a weak-looking structure. Now, I want to show patterns using several plants: one with both water and light, one with just water, one with just light, and one with neither. I remember to add labels but might forget an arrow or two to show that water and light make plants thrive. Maybe I'll forget to mention how the plant without light also looks unhealthy. I need to add color to show the difference between healthy and unhealthy plants, using green for healthy leaves and brown or yellow for the unhealthy ones.",
  "Prompt": "A student's drawing of four plants in a row on white paper. The first plant is tall and healthy with bright green leaves, labeled 'Plenty of Water and Light'. The second plant is wilted with drooping brown leaves, labeled 'Without Water'. The third plant is pale with yellowing leaves, labeled 'Without Light'. The last plant is small and withered, labeled 'Without Water and Light'. Some labels are missing arrows. The drawing is done in colored pencils with effort in color detail, especially in showing the healthiness and unhealthiness of plants, but lacks precision in some labels and arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's proficiency by highlighting the clear differences between healthy and unhealthy plants as they understand it. It includes labels to denote different conditions, but with a hint of inconsistency as some arrows might be unclear or missing. The drawing represents the student's ability to illustrate different plant conditions while illustrating certain patterns. The issues in labeling reflect what the student might struggle with, such as forgetting to illustrate some connections between conditions and plant health."
