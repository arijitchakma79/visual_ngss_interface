  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water and light.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a healthy plant with basic details, showing an attempt to indicate it has both water and light (e.g., a sun and raindrops nearby).",
    "The student might illustrate a plant that lacks water by showing it drooping or having fewer leaves, although the details might be simplistic.",
    "The student can draw a sun alongside some plants, suggesting an attempt to show the importance of light."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly differentiate between the effects of a lack of water vs. lack of light in separate drawings (e.g., both may just look smaller or less leafy, without distinctive features).",
    "The student might label some parts incorrectly or not use labels at all to indicate that a plant needs water and light (e.g., no explicit labels for 'needs water' or 'needs light').",
    "The student often confuses the signs of lacking water with lack of light, such as drawing a plant without light but showing it as dry and brown *(confuses plant responses)*."
