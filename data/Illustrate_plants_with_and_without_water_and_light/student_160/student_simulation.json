  "Reasoning": "I’ll start with drawing a healthy plant that gets plenty of water and light. I remember that such a plant will have green leaves, strong stems, and visible roots. I can draw the leaves big and green to show that it’s growing well. Next, I'll draw a plant without enough water. I'll make the leaves droopy and brownish to show wilting. For a plant that doesn't get enough light, I’ll make it look pale and small, like it's not growing correctly. I need to label the parts - leaves, stems, and roots. Sometimes I forget roots or mix up the labels, so I'll try my best but might miss one. I'll also show how different they look over time; maybe I'll draw the healthy one a little taller over time and the light-deprived one small but won’t make big changes. I hope my drawings clearly show how water and light affect the plants, but I might make simple representations, like how healthy and wilting plants look without showing future progression stages well.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing three plants with distinct conditions. The first plant is vibrant, with large, green leaves, strong stems, and some roots visible in brown soil, indicating it's healthy due to plenty of water and light. The second plant has droopy, brown leaves showing wilting, demonstrating lack of water, with a similar background of soil. The third plant is small and pale with fewer leaves, representing lack of light, sitting in the same soil setting. Labels for 'leaves', 'stems', and 'roots' are present, though one might be missing or slightly misplaced. Style is a simple, colored pencil drawing with a focus on colors to depict health: bright greens and browns for the healthy plant, dull browns and lighter colors for the struggling plants.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student’s level by showing effort to clearly depict the effects of water and light on plant health through colors and size. It incorporates potential errors in labeling and shows effort in drawing distinct plant conditions without complex progression stages over time, aligning with both the student’s capabilities and misunderstandings."
