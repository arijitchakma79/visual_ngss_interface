  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant that has plenty of water and light. I remember that a healthy plant has green leaves and a strong stem. I'll add a sun above the plant to show it has light, and draw some water droplets near the roots to indicate it's well-watered. Next, I'll draw another plant that doesn't have water. This plant should look a little wilty, with droopy leaves. I'll make sure to label it 'no water' so it's clear. Now, I'll draw a plant that's not getting any light. Without light, the plant won't be very healthy, so I'll make the leaves pale and droopy. I'll try to remember to label this 'no light,' but sometimes I forget to label one of the plants correctly. Let me check that I use the same symbols for light and water across all drawings, but I have to be careful since I sometimes mix them up. Finally, I'll draw both plants side by side to compare. The healthy plant will be vibrant and upright, while the plants lacking resources will look weaker and wilting.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing featuring three plants. The first plant on the left is healthy with bright green leaves and a strong stem, with a bright yellow sun above and blue water droplets near its roots. The second plant in the middle is lacking water, illustrated with slightly wilted, droopy leaves and labeled 'no water' in simple text. The third plant on the right lacks light, shown with slightly pale and drooping leaves and labeled 'no light.' All plants are drawn with a comparison in mind, showing differences. The drawing should be colorful and have a simple, clear, and consistent style, like a young student's drawing. Remember to include green, yellow, and blue for the healthy plant, and slightly dull greens and pale colors for the other two.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's ability to depict healthy and unhealthy plants using correct cues like bright colors for health and wilting signs for lack of resources. Labels emphasize the presence or absence of water/light, promoting understanding. The inconsistency risk lies in potential mix-up of symbols and occasional missing labels. The drawing style matches a young student's effort at the proficient level."
