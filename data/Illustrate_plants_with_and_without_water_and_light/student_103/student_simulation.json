  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant. I know plants have leaves, so I’ll draw a stick with a few lines coming out of it. That should look like a plant, right? For the plant with water and light, I’ll add a round shape near the top as a sun, but I’m not sure if it's enough. Maybe some drops for water, but they might end up looking like dots or puddles on the ground instead of on the plant. Now for the plant without water and light, I think I’ll just draw another plant the same way. Differentiating them is hard; maybe I’ll leave out the sun and water dots because I'm not sure how else to show it. I know plants need water and sunlight but showing that in a picture is tricky, so I’ll just make both look similar.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants. One plant has a stick with a few lines for leaves and a round shape, resembling a sun, above it. There are a few blue dots around the plant as a vague representation of water. The other plant looks identical but without the sun and water indications. The drawing is done in a basic, child-like style using green for the plants and yellow for the sun.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects that the student can draw basic plant shapes but struggles to show the effect of lacking water and light. The sun and water indications are present in a rudimentary way for one plant and absent for the other, aligning with the student's difficulty in differentiating healthy from unhealthy plants or representing their needs accurately."
