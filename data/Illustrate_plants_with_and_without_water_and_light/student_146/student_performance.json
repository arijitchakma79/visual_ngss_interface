  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with some signs of being healthy, possibly adding features like a few green leaves, indicating it has enough water and sunlight.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately show a plant completely dry or wilted due to lack of water; they may confuse dryness with other features like leaf discoloration.",
    "The student cannot consistently depict a plant that lacks sunlight. They might unintentionally make it look like it’s thriving by adding non-faded leaves.",
    "The student may struggle to clearly identify and consistently illustrate patterns showing plants’ needs for water and sunlight across different scenarios (e.g., they may draw a sun with every plant, regardless of whether it’s meant to lack sunlight)."
