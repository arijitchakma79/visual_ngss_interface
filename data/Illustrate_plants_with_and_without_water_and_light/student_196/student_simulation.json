  "Reasoning": "To start, I’ll draw two sets of plants. For the first set, I’ll draw a plant that has water and sunlight. I'll make it look healthy by using colors like green for the leaves and brown for the healthy soil. I remember that healthy plants have rich green leaves, so I'll draw the leaves looking full and vivid. To show that it has sunlight, I’ll include a bright yellow sun in the sky. Next, I’ll draw a plant without water. I should make it look wilting and dry, so I'll draw the leaves drooping and use a dull brown color to show dried-out leaves. The soil underneath will look cracked and dry, too. For the plant without light, I’ll make it look pale and a bit spindly by using lighter greens or even some pale yellow to show the lack of chlorophyll. I’ll draw it reaching out as if searching for light, with thin, weak stems. I'll add labels for each plant to make sure it's clear what I'm showing, like ‘With Water and Light’, ‘Without Water’, and ‘Without Light’. It's important that my drawings show how plants need both water and light to thrive. Hopefully, anyone looking at this will see the pattern that plants look healthy with water and light, but unhealthy without them. I need to make sure I don't forget to label the sun, even if it's obvious.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three plants to illustrate the effects of water and sunlight: 1) A healthy plant with vibrant green leaves and brown soil under a bright yellow sun; 2) A plant without water, shown wilted with drooping brownish leaves and cracked dry soil; 3) A plant without sunlight, depicted with pale green to yellowish leaves and weak, spindly stems. The scene is simple and clear in a hand-drawn, colorful style, with labels: 'With Water and Light', 'Without Water', and 'Without Light'. The sun is clearly labeled to indicate light presence.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes elements that show what the student can do, specifically by illustrating healthy plants with water and light, and unhealthy plants without them. It also considers that the student may overlook some artistic details or labeling, as stated in the 'CANNOT' section, but it ensures the essential components for clarity are present. The use of clear labels and distinct visual contrasts between healthy and unhealthy plants aligns with the student's ability to demonstrate understanding at an advanced level."
