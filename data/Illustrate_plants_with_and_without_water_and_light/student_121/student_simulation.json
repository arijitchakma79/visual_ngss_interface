  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw plants with and without water and light. I think I'll start by drawing a plant. Plants are green, right? I'll use a green crayon to make a tall shape that looks kind of like a plant. I'll draw two more of the same shapes. They all look about the same because I think plants always look green and tall. I don't know what plants look like if they don't have water or light, so I'll just make them the same as the others. Is there a difference without water or light? I'm not sure, I'll just add some soil underneath them using a brown color. Plants need soil, right? But I don't know how to make them look different if they lack water or light. Hmm, I think that'll do it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw three simple and basic green plant shapes with tall green stalks and a few rounded leaves. Each plant looks very similar without any noticeable differences. A brown patch of soil is underneath each plant. The overall style should be simplistic, using crayons, with no detailed variations to indicate changes in plant health.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects what the student can do: drawing basic plant shapes in green, showing the understanding that plants are green, and using a single brown color for soil. It also captures what they cannot do: showing any differences between healthy and unhealthy plants, depicting signs of poor growth, or conveying an understanding that lack of water or light affects plant health. As per their level, all plants appear identical with no indication of varying conditions."
