  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can make a claim about whether changes caused by heating or cooling are reversible or irreversible.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of a material before it is heated or cooled.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of a material after it is heated.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of a material after it is cooled.",
    "The student can illustrate whether a change can be reversed by showing before and after drawings of both heating and cooling.",
    "The student can describe in drawings whether a melted solid can return to its original state by cooling (e.g., ice to water and back to ice).",
    "The student can represent irreversible changes by showing materials that change form permanently (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can connect cause and effect relationships in their drawings to show how heating or cooling leads to changes in materials."
