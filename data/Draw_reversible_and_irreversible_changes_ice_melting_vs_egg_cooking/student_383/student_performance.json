  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can make a clear and accurate claim about whether changes caused by heating or cooling are reversible or irreversible.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of ice before it melts and water after it melts.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of water after it is frozen back into ice.",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of an egg before cooking and after it is cooked.",
    "The student can illustrate whether a change can be reversed by showing before and after drawings of both heating and cooling, accurately depicting ice melting and refreezing.",
    "The student can correctly describe in drawings that a melted solid like ice can return to its original state by cooling.",
    "The student can represent irreversible changes by showing how cooking an egg changes it permanently.",
    "The student can effectively connect cause and effect relationships in their drawings to show how heating or cooling leads to changes in the materials."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally label stages of the process slightly inconsistently, but these errors are minimal and do not impact overall understanding."
