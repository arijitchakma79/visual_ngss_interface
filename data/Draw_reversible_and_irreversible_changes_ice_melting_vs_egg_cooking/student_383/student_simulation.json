  "Reasoning": "First, I need to show ice melting, which is a reversible change. I'll start by drawing a piece of ice, labeling it as 'Ice (Before Melting)'. I remember that ice is solid, so I’ll draw it as a blue cube with some shading to show it's a solid block. Next, I'll draw water in a puddle form and label this drawing 'Water (After Melting)'. Water is liquid, so I’ll use a light blue color and draw puddles with some reflections to show it's now liquid. Now, I'll show that you can reverse this change by cooling the water back into ice. I'll draw another ice cube and label it 'Ice (After Freezing)'. For the egg, I know that cooking it is an irreversible change. I'll draw a whole egg and label it 'Egg (Before Cooking)'. An egg looks smooth and oval, so I'll use a white color for it with a few texture lines. Then, I’ll draw a fried egg and label this 'Egg (After Cooking)'. A fried egg has a white base and yellow yolk, so I’ll use these colors. I’ll make sure to add some wavy lines around the fried egg to show it was cooked. I might mess up the labels slightly or mix them up, but I think it should be mostly accurate.",
  "Prompt": "Drawings of reversible and irreversible changes: First drawing - a blue shaded ice cube labeled 'Ice (Before Melting)'. Second drawing - a light blue puddle labeled 'Water (After Melting)'. Third drawing - another blue shaded ice cube labeled 'Ice (After Freezing)'. Fourth drawing - a smooth white oval egg labeled 'Egg (Before Cooking)'. Fifth drawing - a fried egg with a white base and yellow yolk, along with wavy heat lines, labeled 'Egg (After Cooking)'. The style is simple, with colors carefully chosen to represent the different states of matter.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt mirrors the student's ability to accurately and completely represent the stages of reversible and irreversible changes. The student can draw and label both the reversible (ice melting and refreezing) and irreversible (egg cooking) processes, using color to distinguish between states of matter. The labels reflect the potential for slightly inconsistent labeling, a minor issue that does not detract from the understanding of the concept. The use of simple drawings and labelings corresponds with the advanced level description, ensuring that all necessary elements are displayed."
