  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material before any change, showing its original form or state, such as an ice cube and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing how it looks after being heated, like liquid water from melted ice.",
    "The student may attempt to depict whether the ice can return to its original state by showing solid ice and liquid water but may not fully communicate the reversibility."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to clearly show that the cooked egg cannot revert to its original state (e.g., may show a raw egg after cooking, indicating misunderstanding of irreversibility).",
    "The student may not consistently use arrows or other markers to indicate cause and effect, or show them in the wrong direction, for example, showing water turning into ice without a cooling process arrow.",
    "The student may omit labels or incorrectly use them, such as confusing 'reversible change' and 'irreversible change' due to emerging understanding."
