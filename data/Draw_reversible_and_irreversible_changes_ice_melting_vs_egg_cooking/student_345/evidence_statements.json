  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before any change, showing its original form or state (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing how it looks after being heated (e.g., liquid water from melted ice, solid egg after cooking).",
    "The student can depict whether the material can return to its original state after being cooled or rewarmed, demonstrating reversible changes (e.g., melted ice turned back to ice).",
    "The student can show a situation where the material cannot revert to its original state after being cooled or rewarmed, indicating irreversible changes (e.g., cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can draw the process of change, using arrows or other markers to indicate cause and effect (how heating or cooling leads to changes).",
    "The student can label each drawing with terms like 'heat', 'cooling', 'reversible change', and 'irreversible change' to clarify understanding."
