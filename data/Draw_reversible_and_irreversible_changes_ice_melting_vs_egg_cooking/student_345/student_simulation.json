  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw an ice cube first because I remember ice as the starting point before it heats up. I imagine an ice cube being square and cold, so I’ll make it blue to show it’s cold. Next, I’ll draw some arrows pointing to a puddle of water to show it melts when heated. I remember the water looks clearer than the ice and will color it light blue. Then, I'll attempt to show how ice can become water and maybe I'll add ice again to show the reversibility, but I'm not entirely sure how to make it clear. Now, I'll draw an egg before it cooks; eggs are oval and white, so I’ll draw a big white oval and color it a light yellow for the yolk. To show what happens after cooking, I’ll draw a fried egg with a bright yellow yolk and crinkly edges. I think it’s hard to change a cooked egg back to a raw egg, so I won’t add arrows back. But I might accidentally show another raw egg, suggesting it could be turned back. Maybe I’ll add labels too—'ice' and 'water' for the first one, and 'egg' and 'cooked egg' for the second one—but I might mix up reversible and irreversible terms because I find that confusing.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing reversible and irreversible changes: On the left, a blue square representing an ice cube with arrows pointing to a light blue puddle of water to indicate melting. There is an attempt to show reversibility by adding another ice cube. On the right, a white oval with a yellow center represents a raw egg, with an arrow pointing to a fried egg with a yellow yolk and crispy edges. Labels 'ice,' 'water,' 'egg,' and 'cooked egg' are included, but may be inaccurately or confusingly placed, with potential misuse of terms 'reversible change' and 'irreversible change'. The drawing style is simplistic with crayon or colored pencil techniques.",
  "Explanation": "The drawing prompt reflects the student's ability to depict before and after states of ice and egg, showing ice as a solid and water as a liquid, and a raw egg turning into a cooked egg. However, it also represents the student's struggle with clearly indicating irreversibility for the egg and the potential confusion with labels and directional arrows, aligning well with the student's emerging understanding and their level of science comprehension."
