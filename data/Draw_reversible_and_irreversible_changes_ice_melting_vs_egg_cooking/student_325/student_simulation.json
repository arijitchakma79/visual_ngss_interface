  "Reasoning": "I remember that ice is cold and often looks like a cube. So, I'll start by drawing a big square and call it ice. I think when ice melts, it turns into water, but I'm not sure exactly how to show the melting part. I'll just draw some wavy lines under the ice cube to show that it's melting, and then I'll draw some water next to it, even though Iâ€™m not sure about showing a transition. Next, I'll draw an egg. I know an egg is round, so I'll draw a round shape. But when it's cooked, I'm not sure what changes, so I'll just make it look the same. I don't know how to show heating, so I won't add any extra symbols. I like drawing with bright colors, so I'll use blue for the ice and water and yellow for the egg. I'll use simple shapes since that's easier for me.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like, simple drawing with a blue square representing ice and blue wavy lines underneath it for melting, followed by a blue blob resembling water. Next, a large round yellow shape for an egg, with another identical yellow shape to represent the cooked egg. The style is simplistic, using bright colors like blue for ice and water, and yellow for the egg, with no complex details or transitions.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the beginning level understanding where the student can draw basic shapes like a square for ice and a circle for an egg. The use of blue and yellow indicates the colors they associated with these objects but they fail to accurately show the melting process or any changes in the egg, aligning with what they can and cannot do according to their level of understanding."
