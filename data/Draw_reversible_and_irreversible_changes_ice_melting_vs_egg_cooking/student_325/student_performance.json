  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a basic representation of ice as a cube or blob without detailing the melting process.",
    "The student can attempt to draw an egg but may focus primarily on its shape without indicating changes from cooking."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show ice melting into water or refreezing accurately (e.g., may draw ice once and then water without transition).",
    "The depiction of the egg after cooking is likely missing, incorrect, or nonsensical (e.g., the egg looks the same before and after cooking).",
    "The student may not depict heating or cooling as the cause of the changes (e.g., absent or unclear symbols for heat or cold).",
    "The student cannot explain through drawings if the changes are reversible or irreversible (e.g., no distinction between processes, all changes might appear permanent)."
