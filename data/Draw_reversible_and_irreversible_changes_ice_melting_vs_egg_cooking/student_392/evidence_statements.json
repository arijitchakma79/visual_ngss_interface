  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to a material when it is heated (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to a material when it is cooled (e.g., water turning into ice).",
    "The student can label which changes are reversible (e.g., melted ice becoming water that can freeze again).",
    "The student can label which changes are irreversible (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can connect their drawings to the cause of each change (e.g., heating or cooling).",
    "The student can use reasoning to show that some changes can be undone and others cannot by labeling or annotating their drawings."
