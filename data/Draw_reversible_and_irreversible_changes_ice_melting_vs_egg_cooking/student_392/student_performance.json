  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw each material (ice and egg) in its initial state, showing ice as a solid and egg as a liquid inside the shell.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting into water and the egg cooking into a solid form, with clear visual transition from the initial to the final state.",
    "The student can depict water freezing back into ice, demonstrating a clear understanding of physical state changes",
    "The student can correctly label ice melting and refreezing as reversible changes, with notations explaining the processes of heating and cooling.",
    "The student can correctly label the cooking of an egg as an irreversible change, explaining that heating causes the egg to solidify permanently.",
    "The student can provide reasoning and annotations showing an understanding that some changes, like ice melting, can be undone by reversing the cause (cooling), while others, like cooking an egg, cannot."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit labeling minor details or misspell scientific terms but generally demonstrates strong understanding.",
    "The student might briefly pause or second-guess themselves when labeling changes as reversible or irreversible, but overall makes accurate connections."
