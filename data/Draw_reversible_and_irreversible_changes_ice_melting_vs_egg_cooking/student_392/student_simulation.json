  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing the ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I'll sketch a bluish cube for the ice and label it. Now, I'll draw an arrow to show it melting into water, which I'll draw as a small puddle with some blue ripples. I know that this change is reversible because if I cool the water, it turns back into ice. So, I'll draw another arrow from the water back to the ice, showing it refreezing. I'll label these changes as reversible and write a note about heating and cooling. Next, I'll draw the egg. I'll sketch an egg with a white shell. Inside, I'll draw it as a yellow liquid, labeling it as raw egg. Then I'll show the egg cooking by drawing it in a frying pan turning solid, with an arrow pointing to a cooked egg with a solid white and yellow center. I know this change is irreversible. I'll label this and write a note explaining that cooking causes permanent solidification. I might forget a few details or hesitate a bit while labeling, but I'll try my best to explain each process clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a realistic, colorful science diagram showing reversible and irreversible changes. Start with a bluish ice cube labeled 'Ice (solid)' transitioning to a blue puddle labeled 'Water (liquid)' and back to ice, with arrows indicating melting and refreezing, annotated as 'Reversible Change'. Next, draw a white shelled egg labeled 'Egg (liquid inside)' and show it in a frying pan turning into a solid egg with white and yellow parts, labeled 'Cooked Egg (solid)', with an arrow and note explaining 'Irreversible Change'. Include annotations about heating and cooling, using a clear and educational style with vibrant colors. The drawing should appear advanced with accurate representations and labels, but may have minor spelling errors or slight hesitations in label placements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt describes a detailed visual representation of both reversible and irreversible changes, aligning with the student's ability to accurately depict and label the stages of ice and egg transformations. It also accommodates minor spelling errors or labeling hesitations, reflecting the student's occasional struggles outlined in the 'CANNOT' section. The drawing uses vibrant colors and an educational style suitable for advanced-level representation with clear annotations and labels, capturing the student's intended understanding and presentation of reversible and irreversible changes in this task."
