  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the sequence of a piece of ice melting. I'll start with a solid ice cube. Since I'm at an advanced level, I need to make it clear and accurate. I'll draw it in blue to represent the coldness. Next, I'll show it in a puddle of water, so I'll draw a little puddle beneath it, keeping it the same color for consistency, and label this stage 'melting'. Then, I'll show the water refreezing into an ice cube again. I'll add arrows to indicate the sequence from solid to liquid and back to solid, and label this stage 'freezing'. Now, for the egg cooking part, I'll draw an uncooked egg in a frying pan. I'll make sure to illustrate the whole egg, trying to get the white and yellow colors right. Then I'll draw the cooked egg, focusing on the difference in texture and color. I remember that cooked eggs have whites that are solid and a yolk that's more set, so I'll show these differences. I'll label the process as 'cooking' and write 'irreversible' to highlight the change. Although I try to make all my labels, sometimes I might miss labeling the cooling and heating processes, and my backgrounds are simple since Iâ€™m focusing on the main changes.",
  "Prompt": "A sequence of images illustrating reversible and irreversible changes. First, a blue ice cube melting into water and then refreezing into an ice cube again, with arrows pointing from the ice to the water and back, labeled 'melting' and 'freezing'. Beside it, an illustration of an egg in a frying pan before and after cooking. The uncooked egg shows a clear white and yellow yolk, and the cooked egg appears solid with different textures. The frying pan is simple, and the stages are labeled 'cooking' and 'irreversible'. The drawing style is pencil sketch with pastel colors, focusing on primary elements without detailed backgrounds. Include labels and arrows but note that some phase labels like 'heating' might be omitted.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'CAN' elements because it includes a clear sequence for ice melting and refreezing, highlighting the reversible nature, and shows detailed changes in the egg for irreversibility. It labels all necessary stages like 'melting', 'freezing', 'cooking', and 'irreversible'. The 'CANNOT' aspects are addressed by occasionally missing phase labels like 'heating' and having a simple background, as the focus is on primary changes."
