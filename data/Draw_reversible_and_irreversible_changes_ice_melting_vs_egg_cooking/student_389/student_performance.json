  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a clear sequence of images showing a piece of ice melting into water and then refreezing back into ice, accurately illustrating the reversible nature of the change.",
    "Depict an egg before and after it is cooked, correctly showing why the change is irreversible with details like changes in texture and color.",
    "Label all stages of the processes with appropriate terms like 'melting', 'freezing', 'cooking', and 'irreversible'.",
    "Illustrate and explain the cause (heating or cooling) and its effect on each material accurately, showing understanding of which changes can be reversed."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There may be minor omissions or incomplete labeling, such as missing labels on one of the phases of the ice or egg drawing (e.g., the 'cooling' label might be inconsistent).",
    "Might not include detailed background elements or secondary effects in the drawings due to focusing on primary changes (e.g., avoiding convoluted details of heat sources or ambient temperature effects)."
