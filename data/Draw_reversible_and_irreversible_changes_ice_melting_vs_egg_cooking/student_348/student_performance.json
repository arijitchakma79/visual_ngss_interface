  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the original state of the material before heating or cooling, such as solid ice and a raw egg.",
    "The student can partially depict the material after it has been heated or cooled, like melted water or a cooked egg, though with some inaccuracies.",
    "The student can attempt to show the concept of reversibility with a drawing of water turning back into ice, albeit with incomplete or unclear steps."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to accurately represent the irreversible change, such as not clearly showing that a cooked egg cannot return to a raw state *(student thinks all changes can be reversed)*.",
    "The student may incorrectly label or fail to label changes as reversible or irreversible *(missing labels or misunderstood concept)*.",
    "The student shows minimal understanding of the cause and effect relationships in their drawing (e.g., missing arrows or connections between heating/cooling and change)."
