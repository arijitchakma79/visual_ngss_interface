  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big piece of ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I'll make it look like a block. Next, I will draw water because when ice melts, it turns into water. I'll try to make it clear by drawing some droplets coming off the ice block. Now, I should show that water can turn back into ice. I'll draw another block of ice. Maybe I can add an arrow to show this change, but I’m not sure exactly how to place it. For the egg, I’ll draw a raw egg. I know it’s smooth and round, so I'll sketch that. Then, I'll try to show the cooked egg. I'll make it look scrambled because I think that's what happens when all the white and yolk mix. Maybe I'll add an arrow here too, but I'm not sure if it's necessary. I should label them as reversible and irreversible, but I’m a bit confused if the egg can go back to its original form. I'll just label the changes with ‘change’ instead.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple diagram showing two separate changes. On the left, draw a large block of ice melting into water with some water droplets. Include an arrow pointing to a new block of ice to indicate change. On the right, draw a raw egg next to a scrambled egg, suggesting a change. Use basic labels like 'change'. The drawing is simple, colorful, and done in a child-like style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to identify reversible and irreversible changes at a basic level. The melting ice to water and vice versa demonstrates partial understanding, albeit with unclear pathways. The egg transformation is shown with misunderstanding, suggesting reversibility where there is none, which aligns with the student's struggles. The labels are limited or vague, reflecting the student's incomplete grasp of the concept."
