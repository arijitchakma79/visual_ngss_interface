  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the original state of the material before heating or cooling (e.g., solid ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated or cooled (e.g., melted water, cooked egg).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the material returns to its original state after reversing the process (e.g., showing water turning back into ice, but the cooked egg remaining cooked).",
    "The student can depict the process of heating (e.g., applying heat to ice or an egg) and cooling (e.g., freezing water) that causes the changes.",
    "The student can identify and label the changes as reversible (e.g., melting ice that can refreeze) or irreversible (e.g., cooked egg that cannot return to a raw state).",
    "The student can include cause and effect relationships in their drawing to show how heating or cooling leads to changes in the material."
