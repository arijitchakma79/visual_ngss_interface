  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a rectangle to show the ice cube. I remember that ice is solid, so it needs to look like a block. Now, I'll add some lines to make it seem like it's melting, but I'm not sure how to show it solidifying again, so I'll skip that part. For the egg, I’ll draw an oval to look like a raw egg, and then next to it, like a flat, brownish circle for the cooked egg. Maybe I'll add some steam lines to show it's hot. I think that's cooked. I'm not sure how to show that it can't turn back into a raw egg again, so I won't add anything extra or an arrow. I don't really think about labels, so I'll just leave them out.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing with minimal detail: On the left, a blue rectangle representing a block of ice with some wavy lines underneath to suggest melting, no arrows or additional elements to indicate change. On the right, an oval in white representing a raw egg and a flat, light brown circular shape next to it to represent a cooked egg, with a few wavy lines above it indicating heat. The drawing should be simple, with basic colors and no labels or arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by depicting basic shapes for ice and eggs. The student struggles with indicating reversibility (ice melting and refreezing) and irreversibility (egg cooking), as they do not include arrows or proper transitions in the drawing. The lack of detailed understanding of these processes is evident in the absence of labels and detailed transitions between states."
