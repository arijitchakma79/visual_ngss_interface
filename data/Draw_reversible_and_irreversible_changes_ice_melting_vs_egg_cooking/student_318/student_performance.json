  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may be able to draw a simple depiction of ice without much detail or identify an egg by shape, showing some understanding of the starting state.",
    "The student might show basic, undetailed drawings of melted ice or a solid egg after cooking but without clear labeling or transitions."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to demonstrate the reversible nature of ice melting and refreezing, possibly leaving the drawing incomplete or omitting ice returning to solid form (student doesnâ€™t understand reversibility).",
    "The drawing might not show or incorrectly represent the cooked egg as irreversible, possibly attempting to show it turning back into a raw egg (misunderstands irreversibility).",
    "The student may not use arrows or labels effectively to indicate processes or conditions before and after heating or cooling, or these may be omitted entirely (no understanding of cause-effect relationship)."
