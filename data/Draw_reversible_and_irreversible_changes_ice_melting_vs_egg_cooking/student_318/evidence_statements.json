  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can show what happens to the material after heating or cooling (e.g., ice melts into water, an egg becomes solid).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change is reversible by showing the material after reversing the process (e.g., melted water can be frozen back into ice).",
    "The student can indicate if the change is irreversible by showing that the material does not return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can use arrows and labels to depict causes and effects of heating or cooling on the material."
