  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the initial state of materials, such as ice as solid water and a raw egg, with clear and detailed illustrations.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes occurring after heating, showing ice melting into water and an egg becoming a cooked solid, with precision.",
    "The student can correctly depict the concept of reversibility by showing that melted ice can be turned back into ice and that a cooked egg cannot return to its raw state.",
    "The student can accurately identify and label the cause of changes as heating or cooling directly on the drawing.",
    "The student can illustrate observable patterns clearly, such as showing a cycle of ice-water-ice and distinct states of egg transitioning from raw to cooked, supporting their claim about reversibility or irreversibility."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally leave out a minor label or arrow when illustrating the transitions (e.g., missing an arrow to show direction of change) but these are infrequent and do not impact overall understanding or clarity."
