  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of ice. I should make it look clearly like solid water, so I'll add some cracks and maybe a water texture to show it's frozen. Then, next to the ice, I'll draw a raw egg. Eggs are oval-shaped and smooth, so I'll make sure it's clear by adding some shading to show it's not cooked yet. Now, I'll show what happens to the ice when it melts – it turns into liquid water. I'll draw some drips forming under the melting ice and a little pool forming at the bottom. Then, to show the egg cooking, I'll draw it in a pan. It should look like it's turning into a solid, so I'll change the texture – maybe make it look frothy. To show reversibility, I'll draw an arrow from liquid water back to ice, labeling it 'cooling' to indicate freezing. For the egg, I'll draw an arrow showing it going from raw in the shell to cooked in the pan, labeling it 'heating'; there's no arrow back since it's irreversible. I'm usually careful, but sometimes I could forget to draw an arrow or label, especially under the egg. I'll make everything clear in labels, like 'reversible' for the ice and 'irreversible' for the egg. Finally, I'll use colored pencils – blue for ice and water to represent coldness, and yellow or orange for the egg and heat to show it's cooking.",
  "Prompt": "Illustration of a science task showing reversible and irreversible changes. The image includes a block of ice with visible cracks, drawn in a light blue color to depict frozen water, next to a smooth, oval-shaped raw egg with shading, indicating it's uncooked. There are arrows included: one from the ice leading to a water puddle beneath to indicate melting, with 'melting' label, and an arrow returning to the ice from the puddle labeled 'cooling.' For the egg, show it in a pan on a stove, transforming into a frothy solid state, with an arrow labeled 'heating' and no return arrow. Clear, precise labeling throughout with 'reversible' for ice and 'irreversible' for egg. Use colored pencils with shades of blue, orange, and yellow to show cold and heat effects, and ensure the drawing has a clear and structured layout.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt matches the student's abilities: it includes detailed drawings of initial states and transitions (e.g., ice, water, raw egg, cooked egg) and clearly depicts the concept of reversibility with directional arrows and labels. The image captures the student's ability to illustrate observable patterns like the ice-water-ice cycle and differentiate cooked from raw eggs. It also acknowledges the potential for minor omissions like a missing arrow, which aligns with the student's occasional struggles."
