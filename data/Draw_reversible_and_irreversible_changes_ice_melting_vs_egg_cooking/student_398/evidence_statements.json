  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., ice as solid water, a raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing the change (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg becoming a cooked solid).",
    "The student can depict whether the change is reversible or irreversible:",
    "  - Show how ice, once melted, can be turned back into ice (reversible).",
    "  - Show that a cooked egg cannot turn back into a raw egg (irreversible).",
    "The student can identify and label the cause of the change (heating or cooling) in their drawing.",
    "The student can illustrate how an observable pattern (ice-water-ice, egg-egg) supports their claim about reversibility or irreversibility."
