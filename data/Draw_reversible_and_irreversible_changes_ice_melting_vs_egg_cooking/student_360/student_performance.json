  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice melting into water and water freezing back into ice to show a reversible change.",
    "The student can draw a picture of a raw egg being cooked and remaining solid to show an irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of ice before melting and water after melting, as well as a raw egg before cooking and a cooked egg after cooking.",
    "The student can identify and label the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect (change in state or property) in their drawing.",
    "The student can use their drawing to explain that ice melting and freezing back is reversible, while egg cooking is irreversible, based on the evidence of the changes they observe."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently label all parts of the process, such as missing 'water freezes' labels or forgetting to label the cooked egg as solid (incomplete labeling).",
    "The student may not clearly distinguish that the egg remains solid after cooking, or might not emphasize that the egg cannot return to its raw state (minor gap in explanation)."
