  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice melting into water and water freezing back into ice to show a reversible change.",
    "The student can draw a picture of a raw egg being cooked and remaining solid to show an irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of the materials before and after heating or cooling (e.g., ice before melting, water after melting, raw egg before cooking, cooked egg after cooking).",
    "The student can identify and label the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect (change in state or property) in their drawing.",
    "The student can use their drawing to explain which changes are reversible and which are not, based on the evidence of the changes they observe."
