  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial state (e.g., ice as solid, egg as liquid).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated, showing the change (e.g., ice turning to water, egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can depict whether the change after heating can be reversed by cooling (e.g., water turning back to ice, cooked egg remaining solid).",
    "The student can draw the material after it is cooled, capturing the change (e.g., water turning to ice, a solidified plant leaf).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change after cooling can be reversed by heating (e.g., ice becoming water again, a frozen leaf not returning to normal).",
    "The student can demonstrate their understanding by showing that some changes are reversible with cooling or heating (e.g., melting ice can freeze again) and some are not (e.g., cooked egg cannot become raw again)."
