  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing an ice cube. I know ice is solid and it looks like a cube, so I’ll draw a simple cube and label it 'ice'. Next, I'll show what happens when the ice melts, so I’ll draw the cube with some water around it and arrows pointing to the water, indicating that it's melting. Now, I need to show the water turning back into ice, but I'm not totally sure how perfect that should look. I’ll just draw some of the water in a cup and maybe some ice cubes back in the cup to show it's freezing again. For the egg, I'm a bit confused. I think the egg is liquid inside, but I'll just draw a whole egg and say it's not cooked. Then, I know cooking an egg makes it solid, so I’ll draw a cooked egg. But I'm not sure, maybe it becomes liquid again if you cool it? So I’ll draw arrows to show it might go back to a liquid, but I’m guessing here. I hope that’s okay.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing a simple representation of reversible and irreversible changes. On one side of the image, there is a labeled cube of ice with arrows pointing to a small pool of water reflecting the melting process and a partial attempt to show refreezing by depicting a cup with both water and a couple of ice cubes inside. On the other side, there is a whole egg drawn in its shell, and beside it a cooked egg shown as solid. Incorrectly, arrows suggest the cooked egg might revert to liquid. The style is basic and child-like, with bright, simple colors and clear labels for each object.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects what the student can do, such as illustrating ice melting and an attempt at showing water turning back into ice. It also illustrates misunderstandings in depicting the egg, like drawing a whole egg instead of the liquid insides, and mistakenly indicating the possibility of reversing the cooking process. The hand-drawn style matches the student's level description of emerging understanding and basic elements."
