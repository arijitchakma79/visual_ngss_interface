  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice in its initial solid state before it is heated. (e.g., a simple cube labeled 'ice')",
    "The student can show ice turning to water after heating. (e.g., a melting ice cube with arrows indicating melting)",
    "The student might partially succeed in illustrating water turning back to ice after cooling. (e.g., a cup with both melted water and some ice cubes again)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely to have difficulty showing an egg in its initial liquid state before heating. (e.g., might draw a whole egg rather than its contents)",
    "The student may not clearly depict that a cooked egg becomes solid and remains irreversibly changed. (e.g., might show a solid egg and mistakenly draw arrows suggesting it can return to liquid)",
    "The student might misunderstand irreversible changes, incorrectly depicting that cooling a cooked egg can reverse the cooking. (e.g., drawing an egg returning to liquid after cooling, thinking it 'refreshes')"
