  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of a material (e.g., ice before melting, a raw egg before cooking) to show its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes that occur when the material is heated or cooled (e.g., ice melting to water, an egg becoming solid when cooked).",
    "The student can depict if the changes are reversible, showing the material can return to its original state (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can depict if the changes are irreversible, showing the material cannot return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg not turning back into a raw egg).",
    "The student can convey a cause-and-effect relationship in their drawing, displaying how heating or cooling causes observable changes."
