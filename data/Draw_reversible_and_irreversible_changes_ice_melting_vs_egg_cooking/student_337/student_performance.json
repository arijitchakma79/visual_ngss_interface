  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of a material, such as a block of ice and a raw egg, showing some basic characteristics like a simple cube shape for ice and an oval for the egg.",
    "The student can illustrate that ice turns into water when heated by drawing dripping or melting ice, even if not entirely accurate in form.",
    "The student may include simple representations of heating or cooling, like a drawn flame near the egg and wavy lines for melting or subtle arrows suggesting movement."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately depict the full reversible process for melting ice and refreezing it (e.g., might not show freezing arrows back to ice or might forget to indicate cooling; *(student doesnâ€™t understand reversible concept))*.",
    "The student may inaccurately depict the irreversibility of cooking an egg, possibly showing the egg changing back to a liquid state or forgetting to show stubborn solidity; *(student thinks cooked egg can become raw again)*.",
    "The student might struggle to effectively convey the cause-and-effect relationship, such as forgetting to include or incorrectly placing heating elements or arrows showing the process sequence; *(student shows heating next to ice but not affecting it)*."
