  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Might draw ice as solid (e.g., may include a basic shape or incoherent doodle intending to represent ice).",
    "May show irregular shapes or symbols to indicate change without clear distinction (e.g., attempts to show melting but lacks clarity)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Incorrectly represents the final states of materials (e.g., shows ice turning into fire instead of water).",
    "Does not differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes (e.g., suggests cooked egg can turn back into raw egg).",
    "Fails to include explanations or labels indicating reversibility (e.g., no labels or indicates all changes are reversible).",
    "Misunderstands or omits characteristics of heated materials (e.g., may not show any change at all in ice melting)."
