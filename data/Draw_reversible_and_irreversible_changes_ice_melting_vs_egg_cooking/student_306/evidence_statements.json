  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can accurately draw the characteristics of a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice as a solid block).",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of a material after it has been heated (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can depict the characteristics of a material after it has been cooled (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can represent the changes in a material after heating that are irreversible (e.g., a raw egg changing to a cooked egg).",
    "The student can show that some changes can be reversed by illustrating both the initial and final states of a material (e.g., ice becomes water and water can become ice again).",
    "The student can illustrate that some changes cannot be reversed by showing the initial and final states of a material (e.g., a cooked egg stays solid even when cooled).",
    "The student can include an explanation or label indicating which changes are reversible and which are irreversible."
