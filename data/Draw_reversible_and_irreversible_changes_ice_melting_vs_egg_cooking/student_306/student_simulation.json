  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing an ice cube. I know ice is solid, so I'll make a square shape to show it. I've seen ice melt before, so I'll try to show it's turning into liquid. I'll use some wavy lines around the ice, but I'm not sure how to show that it's becoming water, so it might look a bit messy. For the egg cooking, I'll draw an oval for the egg. I remember that when we cook an egg, it doesn't go back to how it was, but I'm not sure how to show that, so I'll make some squiggly lines to show change or heat. I might mix up some details about whether the changes are permanent or not.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting an ice cube as a simple blue square with wavy lines underneath it, attempting to indicate melting. Next to it, a yellow oval represents an egg, with red and orange squiggly lines around it showing change. The drawing style is basic and uses simple colors. The background is white, resembling a crayon drawing without clear labels or accurate depictions of states.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes for ice and an egg, showcasing minimal understanding of change. The student cannot accurately depict melting or cooking processes, indicated by unclear wavy and squiggly lines and lack of labels. The drawing does not differentiate between reversible (melting) and irreversible (cooking) changes, matching what the student cannot do."
