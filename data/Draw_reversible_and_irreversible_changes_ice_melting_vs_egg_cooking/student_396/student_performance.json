  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the initial states of the materials, labeling 'solid ice' and 'raw egg' clearly.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes in the materials after heating, showing 'melted water' and 'cooked egg'.",
    "The student can represent the reversibility of ice melting by showing the water turning back to ice upon cooling, labeling this process clearly.",
    "The student clearly indicates that the cooked egg is an irreversible change, often by writing 'cannot be reversed' next to it.",
    "The student can distinguish between the reversible process of ice melting and the irreversible change of egg cooking, using explanations or labels to support their illustrations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally omit an explanation in one part of the drawing when labeling might suffice (natural variation).",
    "The student may sometimes slightly mislabel a component like 'liquid water' as 'melted ice' in one section, though likely corrects it elsewhere."
