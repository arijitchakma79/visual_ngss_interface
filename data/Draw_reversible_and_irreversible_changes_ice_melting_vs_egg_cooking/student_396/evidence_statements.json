  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, labeling its initial state (e.g., solid ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it has been heated or cooled, indicating the change (e.g., melted water, cooked egg).",
    "The student can show whether the change in the material is reversible by including the reversed state or explaining it cannot be reversed.",
    "The student can represent the change in the material after cooling, identifying the state change (e.g., water back to ice, cooked egg does not change).",
    "The student can distinguish between reversible and irreversible changes in their drawing, with an explanation or labels indicating why the change is or isn't reversible."
