  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start by drawing two separate panels side by side to show the changes. On the left, I'll draw the initial state of the ice – a solid cube labeled 'solid ice'. Next to it, I'll draw an egg labeled 'raw egg'. I remember the ice needs to show reversible change, so I'll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle with 'melted water'. I’ll make sure to label these clearly. To show reversibility, I'll add another arrow pointing back from the puddle to the ice cube, labeling it 're-freezing to solid ice'. For the egg, I'll draw an arrow from the raw egg to a cooked egg. To show it’s an irreversible change, I'll label it 'cooked egg' with 'cannot be reversed' written next to it. I am careful not to mix up my labels, but I might accidentally label the water as 'melted ice' instead of 'liquid water' in one place. Finally, I’ll make sure everything is neat, using colors like blue for the ice and water, and yellow and white for the egg to make everything clear.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two panels showing reversible and irreversible changes. In the first panel, draw an ice cube labeled 'solid ice', with an arrow pointing to a water puddle labeled 'melted water', and another arrow pointing back to the ice cube labeled 're-freezing to solid ice'. Use blue for the ice and water. In the second panel, draw a raw egg labeled 'raw egg' with an arrow pointing to a cooked egg labeled 'cooked egg', and write 'cannot be reversed' next to it. Use yellow and white for the eggs. Ensure the illustration is clear and accurate.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw and label the states of materials and indicate their changes. They can distinguish between reversible and irreversible processes and generally label elements correctly. Any small mislabel, like calling the water 'melted ice', aligns with potential minor misunderstandings. The drawing uses color and clear labels, reflecting the student's advanced level and understanding."
