  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw how things change. First, I'll draw some ice cubes. They look like squares, or maybe kind of like little blocks, and I'll color them blue because ice is cold. Next, I know ice can melt, so I'll draw some squiggly lines around it to show it's getting warm. But I'm not really sure what happens after that, so I think I'll just leave it as ice. Now, for the egg. I'll draw an egg, kind of oval-shaped, and maybe I'll add a little circle in the middle for the yolk. I'll draw some wavy lines around it too because when you cook an egg, it gets hot. I'm not sure what to do after that, so I'll just leave it as an egg. I remember something about one thing being reversible and the other not, but I don't know how to show that in my drawing. I'll just draw a couple of arrows pointing to both drawings to show they're changing, but I'm not sure if I'm doing that right.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing a simple blue ice cube with squiggly lines around it. Next to it, an egg with a yellow yolk inside, also with wavy lines around it. There are arrows drawn to both the ice and the egg, but they aren't labeled or clearly placed. The drawing is colorful with blue for the ice and a mix of white and yellow for the egg. The style is basic and lacks detail, suggesting a minimal understanding of the changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including simple drawings of an ice cube and an egg, as well as primitive heating indications like squiggly lines. It shows the student's struggles because the drawing doesn't effectively depict changes or reversibility, with both materials remaining largely unchanged after supposed heating. The arrows are included to demonstrate an attempt to show change but remain unlabeled, reflecting a misunderstanding of cause and effect. Overall, there's no clear differentiation between reversible and irreversible changes."
