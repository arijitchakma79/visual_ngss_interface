  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start by drawing a piece of ice. I remember ice is solid so I'll make it look like a cube with edges. I'll label it as 'Ice - Solid.' Next, I’ll draw the ice melting into water. I'll make it look like a puddle and label it 'Water - Liquid.' I know ice can turn back into solid, so I’ll add a note saying 'can freeze again.' Now, I'll try to draw an egg because I know I need to show it cooking. I think eggs look like ovals, so I'll draw an oval shape. But I don’t really understand how to show an egg cooking. I'll just draw some wavy lines under the egg and label it 'Heat.' I don’t really know how to show that the egg has cooked or what happens after it’s cooked, so that’s a bit confusing. I know the egg thing is supposed to mean it can't change back, but I don’t quite get how to draw or explain that.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing with simple, naive style. On the left, a clear ice cube labeled 'Ice - Solid' next to a puddle labeled 'Water - Liquid'. An arrow and note saying 'can freeze again' shows an attempt to describe reversibility. On the right, an egg-shaped oval with wavy lines labeled 'Heat', lacking any details on cooking changes. All drawn with basic colors like blue for ice and yellow for egg, demonstrating basic understanding and some misconceptions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability by accurately depicting the reversible change of ice melting and refreezing, with basic labels. It reflects their struggle in illustrating and explaining the cooking process of an egg due to confusion and lack of understanding about irreversible changes, consistent with the 'cannot' aspects."
