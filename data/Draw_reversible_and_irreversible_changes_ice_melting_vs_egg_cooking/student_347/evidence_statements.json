  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material being heated and label its initial characteristics before heating (e.g., ice as solid).",
    "The student can illustrate the changes that occur when the material is heated (e.g., ice melting to water) and label these changes.",
    "The student can draw and label whether the change from heating can be reversed by cooling (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can depict a material being heated in a way that cannot be reversed (e.g., a raw egg becoming solid when cooked), and label its characteristics after heating.",
    "The student can illustrate a similar change, if applicable, showing another material cooling and the resulting form (e.g., water freezing into ice), and label these changes.",
    "The student can label whether the change from cooling can be reversed (e.g., a leaf does not return to normal once it dies).",
    "The student can annotate their drawing with a simple claim about reversibility, supported by their illustrations (e.g., \"Ice melting can be reversed by cooling, but a cooked egg cannot\")."
