  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big ice cube to show that it's in a solid state. I'll label it 'Solid Ice.' Next to it, I'll draw a puddle of water to show that the ice has melted into 'Melted Water.' I know I should show that this is reversible, so I'll draw an arrow from the water back to a new ice cube and label it 'Re-freezing.' Now for the egg, I'll start by drawing an uncooked egg and label it 'Raw Egg.' Next to it, I'll draw a fried egg to show it's been cooked, and I'll label it 'Cooked Egg.' I think cooking the egg is irreversible, but I might forget that sometimes, so I might accidentally draw an arrow backwards like for the ice. I might forget to add arrows or mess up the labels a bit. I probably should also show temperature differences between the stages, but I tend to leave that out, too.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two distinct scenes side by side. On the left, depict a large, blue-tinted ice cube labeled 'Solid Ice' melting into a puddle labeled 'Melted Water' with a blue arrow indicating the process. Include a reversed arrow from the water back to another ice cube labeled 'Re-freezing.' On the right, draw a scene with a brown raw egg labeled 'Raw Egg' next to a yellow and white cooked egg labeled 'Cooked Egg.' Accidentally include a faint arrow between the cooked and raw egg, suggesting a reversible process. Use labels in clear block letters and bright colors like blues, yellows, and browns. The drawing should be neat but slightly simplified, showing effort but lacking some intricate details like temperature",
  "Explaination": "The ice melting and refreezing is clearly depicted, addressing the student's ability to show reversibility, but the student's occasional misunderstanding about the egg's irreversibility is included by the accidental arrow between the eggs. Missing temperature details reflect the student's tendency to leave out some nuances, consistent with being proficient but not advanced."
