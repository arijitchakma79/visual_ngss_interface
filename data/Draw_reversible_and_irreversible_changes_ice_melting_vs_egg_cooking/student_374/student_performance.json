{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the ice in its solid state before melting and as water after melting, showing a clear change.",
    "The student can illustrate the egg in its raw state before cooking and in its cooked state after heating, indicating an irreversible change.",
    "The student can include labels such as 'Solid Ice,' 'Melted Water,' 'Raw Egg,' and 'Cooked Egg' to explain each stage.",
    "The student can represent the reversible change by showing that melted water can be frozen back into ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently explain the irreversibility of the cooked egg (may label it as reversible in some parts).",
    "The student may forget to clearly illustrate or label what happens if ice is refrozen, showing an incomplete understanding of the reversible cycle.",
    "The student might leave out some characteristics or details in the drawing, such as temperature differences between the states."
