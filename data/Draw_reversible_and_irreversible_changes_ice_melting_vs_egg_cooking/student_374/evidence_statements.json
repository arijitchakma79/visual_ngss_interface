  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material in its original state before any heating or cooling is applied.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it has been heated or cooled to show the change.",
    "The student can clearly represent whether the change in the material is reversible or irreversible by drawing what happens if the process is reversed (e.g., heating followed by cooling, or vice versa).",
    "The student can include labels or brief explanations in their drawing to describe the characteristics of the material at each stage (before, after, and if reversible, after reversal).",
    "The student can use their drawing to construct an argument, explaining whether the change is reversible or irreversible based on observable patterns and effects."
