  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of an ice cube with some clarity, showing it as a solid block.",
    "The student can depict an egg in its raw form, likely as an oval or simple shape.",
    "The student can represent melted water after heating, possibly incorporating some wavy lines or drips to indicate a change.",
    "The student attempts to differentiate reversible from irreversible changes using basic labels or simple text, such as 'ice to water' and 'egg'."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to show the initial state of the egg with detail or labels, potentially drawing a nondescript shape that lacks clarity.",
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate what melted ice looks like after refreezing, possibly omitting or confusing this step (e.g., never returning the water back to ice).",
    "The student may not show any depiction of a cooked egg or might confuse the egg's cooked and raw states (e.g., showing an uncooked yolk with a caption 'cooked').",
    "Visual representation of the concept of reversibility in the water cycle might be unclear or missing (e.g., no arrows or incorrect placement in a sequence).",
    "The student might inconsistently apply labels or arrows to show cause and effect, such as missing arrows to indicate heating leads to changes."
