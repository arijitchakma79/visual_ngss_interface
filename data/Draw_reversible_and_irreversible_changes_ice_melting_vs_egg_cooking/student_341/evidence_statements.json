  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can represent what the material looks like after it undergoes heating (e.g., melted water, cooked egg).",
    "The student can show whether the change is reversible by illustrating what happens if the process is reversed (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can depict whether or not the material returns to its original state after reversing (e.g., cooked egg remains solid).",
    "The student can differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes with visual cues or labels in their drawing.",
    "The student can connect events to their causes and effects through their drawings, demonstrating that heating or cooling leads to specific changes."
