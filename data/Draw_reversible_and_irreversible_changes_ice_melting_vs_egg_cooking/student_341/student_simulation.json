  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw an ice cube. I remember that ice is just frozen water, so I'll try to make it look like a solid block, maybe with some light blue color so it looks icy. Next, I'll draw an egg. I know an egg is kind of oval-shaped, so I'll try drawing it like that. Now, I want to show the ice melting into water. I’ll use wavy lines or some drips to show that it’s turning into liquid. For the egg, I need to show that it gets cooked. I’ll write 'egg' next to it but showing a cooked egg is hard for me; I'll just leave it as an oval for now. I’ll try writing 'ice to water' near the melting ice to make things clear. I should make arrows to show how heating changes them, but I sometimes forget which way they go or miss them out. I know I'm meant to show reversible and irreversible changes, but I get confused with the water cycle and forget to add arrows pointing between the states. I’ll make some basic labels, though they might not all be right.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a light blue ice cube on the left and an oval representing an egg on the right. The melting of the ice is indicated by wavy blue lines or drips turning into water. Next to the ice cube, there is a basic label saying 'ice to water'. The egg is labeled 'egg', but there’s no clear change to a cooked egg state. The drawing shows minimal detail and lacks arrows indicating process or reversibility, with simple handwriting and a mix of basic shapes and labels. The colors are simple, with light blue for ice, and a plain egg shape in a simplistic, child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt aligns with the student's abilities because it captures their capacity to draw the ice cube and depict its melting with some effort, while also showing their limitations in illustrating the cooked egg and conveying process changes using labels and arrows. The student can initially label states, but they struggle with detailing and showing reversibility, which is why the drawing lacks arrows and refreezing depiction."
