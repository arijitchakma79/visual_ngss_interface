  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a block of ice on the left side of the page. Ice is solid, so I'll make it look like a cube, maybe with a few jagged edges to show it's solid. I remember ice is clear, but I'll shade it bluish so it stands out. Next to the ice, I'll draw a puddle of water, showing the ice has melted. I'll draw it with curvy, wavy lines to show it's liquid and maybe add some reflection lines to show it's flowable. I'll label these drawings 'Ice - Solid' and 'Water - Liquid'. Now, moving to the right side of the page, Iâ€™ll draw an egg. First, a whole egg with a smooth texture, and then I'll show it cracked open in a pan to represent cooking. After that, I'll draw a cooked egg with some browning on the edges to show its solidity and change. I'll label these 'Egg - Raw' and 'Egg - Cooked'. I think it's important to show that the cooked egg is not going back to raw, so I'll add an arrow between the raw and cooked egg labeled 'Irreversible'. On the other side, I'll draw arrows back and forth between the ice and water to show they can change back and forth. My teacher mentions that highlighting how these changes can't reverse back is important. I might skip writing the exact temperatures, but I think my labels are enough to show the ideas.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a two-panel illustration. On the left panel, show a clear blue ice cube labeled 'Ice - Solid' next to a puddle of water labeled 'Water - Liquid', with arrows going back and forth labeled 'Reversible'. On the right panel, depict a whole egg with a smooth texture labeled 'Egg - Raw' and a cooked egg with slightly browned edges labeled 'Egg - Cooked', with an arrow between them labeled 'Irreversible'. Use colored pencil style with soft shading.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes accurate depictions of reversible and irreversible changes, with attention to labeling states and using arrows to indicate reversibility, matching what the student can do. However, it doesn't include specific temperatures or finely detailed textures beyond what is typical for Level 4, reflecting areas where the student might occasionally struggle or omit detail."
