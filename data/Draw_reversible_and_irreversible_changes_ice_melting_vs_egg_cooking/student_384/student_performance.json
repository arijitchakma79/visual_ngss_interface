  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately illustrate a material before and after it is heated, showing ice as solid before heating and water as liquid after heating.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate a material before and after it is cooled, showing water as liquid before cooling and ice as solid after cooling.",
    "The student can correctly draw a comparison between a reversible change (ice melting and freezing) and an irreversible change (egg cooking and remaining solid).",
    "The student can highlight characteristics of materials in their original and changed states, such as ice being solid and clear, and water being liquid and flowable.",
    "The student can illustrate that some changes are reversible through heating or cooling, like water to ice, and accurately show that changes like a cooked egg cannot revert to raw."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally omit minor details, such as labeling every characteristic of the changes in state (e.g., the specific texture of a cooked egg).",
    "The student may not consistently detail the exact conditions needed for each change, like specific temperatures (natural variation in focus on detail)."
