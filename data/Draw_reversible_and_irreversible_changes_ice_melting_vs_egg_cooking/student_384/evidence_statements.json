  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before and after it is heated, showing changes (e.g., ice before heating and water after heating).",
    "The student can illustrate a material before and after it is cooled, showing changes (e.g., water before cooling and ice after cooling).",
    "The student can draw a comparison between a reversible change (e.g., ice melting and freezing) and an irreversible change (e.g., an egg cooking and staying solid).",
    "The student can highlight the characteristics of materials in their original and changed states (e.g., ice appears solid and clear, water is liquid and flows).",
    "The student can show through illustration that some changes can be reversed by cooling or heating (like water becoming ice and vice versa) and some cannot (like a cooked egg not becoming raw again)."
