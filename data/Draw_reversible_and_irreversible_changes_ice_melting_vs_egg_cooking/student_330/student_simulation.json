  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the ice cube. I remember that ice is a solid, so I’ll draw a clear square shape with some blue to show it's cold. Then, I need to show what happens when it melts. I'll draw a puddle of water next to it and use an arrow to connect them to show ice turning into water when heated. I know arrows show change, but I might not think of drawing a reverse arrow back to ice. Now, for the egg, I'll sketch an egg in its shell and next to it, I'll draw a fried egg to show what happens when heated. I need to use an arrow to connect the raw egg to the cooked one, but I won't draw an arrow back because I think cooking can't be undone. For the labels, I'll write 'ice' and 'water' for the first part, and 'egg' and 'cooked egg' for the second, but I might use the arrow labels wrong because I sometimes get mixed up with cause and effect labels.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an educational science illustration. On the left, sketch a blue ice cube with a curvy arrow pointing to a puddle of water, both labeled. On the right, draw a whole egg with a bold arrow pointing to a fried egg. Label them correctly below with text: 'ice', 'water', 'egg', 'cooked egg'. Use hand-drawn style with simple colors like blue for the ice and yolk color for the fried egg.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the student’s ability to draw the initial states and transformations (ice to water, raw to cooked egg) with simple labels, as they can do this. However, it does not include showing ice turning back to its solid state because the student forgets, and it doesn’t show the egg going back to raw as they know it's not possible. The arrows used are one-way, showing change without reversal for cooking, aligning with the student’s understanding of irreversibility and inconsistent use with reversible changes."
