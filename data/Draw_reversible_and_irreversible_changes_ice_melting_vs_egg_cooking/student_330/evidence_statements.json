  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can represent the initial state of a material before heating or cooling, such as ice or a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the change that occurs in the material when heated, such as ice melting into water or a raw egg cooking into a solid form.",
    "The student can show if the change in the material is reversible by depicting the material after cooling, such as water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can indicate when a change is irreversible, for example, once an egg is cooked, it cannot return to its raw state.",
    "The student can use labels or arrows to explain the cause and effect, like heating causing ice to melt or an egg to cook, and cooling causing water to freeze.",
    "The student can provide evidence in the drawing that supports whether the material's change is reversible or irreversible, using side-by-side comparisons.",
    "The student can demonstrate reasoning by connecting evidence in the drawing, such as showing a sequence from raw to cooked egg, and ice melting and freezing back again."
