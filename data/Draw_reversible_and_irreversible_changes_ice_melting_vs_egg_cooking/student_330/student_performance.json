  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can represent the initial state of the material before heating, such as drawing ice and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the change that occurs in the material when heated, like showing ice melting into water or a raw egg cooking into a solid form.",
    "The student can use basic labels or arrows to indicate that heating causes ice to melt or an egg to cook."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently show if the change in material is reversible, such as reverting water to ice, due to confusion or incomplete understanding (student may forget to include freezing back into ice).",
    "The student may misunderstand irreversibility and attempt to show an egg becoming raw again after being cooked (student lacks understanding that cooking is irreversible).",
    "The student may inconsistently use arrows or labeling to connect cause and effect, sometimes showing them incorrectly or omitting them due to a developing grasp of these concepts."
