  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label a picture showing a change caused by heating (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg cooking).",
    "The student can draw and label a picture showing a change caused by cooling (e.g., water freezing into ice, a heated object cooling down).",
    "The student can draw a reversible change and show how it can return to its original state (e.g., water that can freeze into ice and then melt again).",
    "The student can draw an irreversible change and explain why it cannot return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can illustrate and label the key characteristics of materials before and after heating or cooling to show understanding of the changes.",
    "The student can demonstrate cause-and-effect through drawings by showing the sequence of changes when materials are heated or cooled."
