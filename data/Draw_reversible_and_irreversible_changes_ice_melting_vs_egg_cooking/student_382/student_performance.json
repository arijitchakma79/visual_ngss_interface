  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw and label a picture showing a change caused by heating, such as ice melting into water or an egg cooking, with clear indications of heat source and change process.",
    "The student can accurately draw and label a picture showing a change caused by cooling, such as water freezing into ice, indicating the temperature change and resulting new state.",
    "The student can effectively illustrate a reversible change by showing how water can freeze into ice and then melt back into water, with labels and arrows illustrating the reversible process.",
    "The student can accurately draw an irreversible change and provide a textual explanation of why a cooked egg cannot revert to its raw state, showcasing understanding of chemical changes.",
    "The student can successfully illustrate and label the key characteristics of materials before and after heating or cooling, demonstrating a solid grasp of the physical changes occurring.",
    "The student can effectively demonstrate cause-and-effect through drawings by showing the sequence of changes when materials are heated or cooled, using visual aids like arrows to indicate the direction of change."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have occasional, minor lapses in labeling consistency, such as missing a label on one of the changes, due to oversight but not misunderstanding.",
    "The student might show a slightly inconsistent representation of temperature changes on a scale (e.g., fluctuations in arrow sizes or less precise temperatures), which does not detract significantly from overall understanding."
