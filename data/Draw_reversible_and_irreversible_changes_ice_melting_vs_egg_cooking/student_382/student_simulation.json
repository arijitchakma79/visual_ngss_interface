  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing the reversible change of ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice. I remember that I need to clearly indicate the heat source and the temperature change. I’ll draw an ice cube on the left with an arrow pointing to a puddle of water to its right, showing that it melts when heated. Then I'll draw another arrow going back from the puddle to an ice cube, showing it can freeze again. For the irreversible change, I'll show an egg. I'll draw a raw egg in a frying pan with a stove beneath it. I'll make sure to draw little wavy lines coming up from the stove to show the heat. I'll label the egg as 'raw egg' and the cooked one as 'cooked egg'. Lastly, I need to write a short explanation next to the egg drawing saying why it can't go back to being raw. I’ll admit, sometimes I forget to label everything, but I'll try to be careful not to miss anything. For temperature changes, sometimes my arrows look a bit inconsistent in size, but I'll make sure to use them effectively to show the direction of changes.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed diagram with realistic colors. On the left side, depict an ice cube labeled 'ice'. Next to it, show an arrow pointing right towards a puddle of water labeled 'water', with a small sun graphic labeled 'heat source' above to indicate melting. Then, draw another arrow going from 'water' back to 'ice', showing refreezing. On the right side, draw a raw egg in a frying pan on a stove, with wavy lines rising from the stove to indicate heat, label the egg as 'raw egg' and the stove as 'heat source'. Next to it, draw a cooked egg in the pan labeled 'cooked egg'. Include a brief caption explaining why the egg change is irreversible. The style is a realistic hand-drawn, colorful representation with visible labels and arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to effectively show reversible and irreversible processes through clear labeling, arrows, and explanations. The prompt emphasizes the need for demonstration of processes, which the student is capable of, including the use of realistic colors and proper labeling. The minor struggles with labeling consistency and arrow sizing are noted as areas of diligence in the drawing task."
