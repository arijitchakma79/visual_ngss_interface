  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the state of a material before it undergoes heating or cooling (e.g., ice in solid form, a raw egg).",
    "The student can depict the state of the same material after it has been heated (e.g., melted ice as water, a cooked egg).",
    "The student can show the state of the material after cooling, if applicable (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate whether the change is reversible by showing the return of the material to its original state, if possible (e.g., water freezing back into ice) or explain why it is not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg cannot return to its raw state).",
    "The student can use an arrow or label to indicate the direction of change (e.g., ice melting to water with a label 'melting' and water freezing back to ice with a label 'freezing')."
