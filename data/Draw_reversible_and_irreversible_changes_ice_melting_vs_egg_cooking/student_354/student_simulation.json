  "Reasoning": "I'll start with the ice part. First, I need to illustrate the state of the ice before melting, so I’ll draw an ice cube, maybe with some shading to show it's cold and solid. Next, I'll show what the ice looks like after it melts. I think I'll draw a puddle of water with some droplets next to it. Since it's a reversible change, I'll add an arrow labeled 'melting' pointing from the ice cube to the puddle. Now, to show it can turn back into ice, I'll draw another arrow labeled 'freezing' pointing back to a smaller ice cube. Now for the egg part. I'll draw a whole egg to show it raw, and next to it, I'll crack it open so you can see the yolk and the white. Then I’ll depict the cooked egg, maybe scrambled with some pieces of it scattered. I’ll add an arrow between the raw and cooked egg, but I might forget to label it this time. I know cooking is irreversible; I can't make it raw again, but I’m not sure how to illustrate that clearly. So, I'll leave it without explanation. Hopefully, my drawing shows most of what I understand about changes.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing two scientific concepts of change. On the left: a sequence of ice turning into water and back to ice. First, an ice cube (blue and white, solid form), with an arrow labeled 'melting' pointing to a blue puddle of water with droplets. Another arrow labeled 'freezing' leads back to a smaller ice cube. On the right: a whole egg (white and brown, intact) next to a cracked egg showing yolk (yellow) and egg white. Adjacent is a scrambled egg (yellow and white, cooked). An arrow points from the cracked egg to the scrambled egg without any label. Colorful and simple, like a school project with attention mostly on correct sequence but some missing labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to illustrate and label the reversible change of ice melting and freezing but struggles with consistently labeling the irreversible change of cooking the egg. The illustration shows the steps and direction of change for both ice and egg, but the absence of a label on the arrow in the egg depiction reflects the student's tendency to forget or not fully complete labeling, in line with their level description."
