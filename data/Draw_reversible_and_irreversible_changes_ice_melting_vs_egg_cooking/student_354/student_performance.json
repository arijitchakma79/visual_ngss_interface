  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate the state of ice before melting (e.g., ice cube in solid form).",
    "Depict the state of the ice after melting (e.g., water puddle or droplets).",
    "Show the state of the water after cooling if applicable (e.g., small water puddle turning back into ice).",
    "Depict a raw egg before cooking (e.g., whole egg or cracked with yolk visible).",
    "Illustrate the egg after it has been cooked (e.g., scrambled or fried egg).",
    "Use arrows or labels to indicate the direction of change, such as labeling 'melting' for ice to water and 'freezing' for water back to ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently label all arrows or changes (e.g., may forget to label 'cooking' for raw to cooked egg).",
    "Clearly demonstrate why the egg change is irreversible due to a lack of detailed labeling (e.g., may not label 'cooking' as irreversible or explain why it cannot be returned to its raw state)."
