  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a piece of ice on one side, which is the initial state before it melts. I remember that I should draw it in a block form and label it as 'Ice'. Then, next to it, I’ll draw a puddle of water to show what happens when the ice melts. I'll label this 'Water'. To show the reversible change, I’ll draw an arrow going back from the water to another ice block, showing the freezing process. I should label the arrow to show it's about cooling, but I might forget to do that. Now, for the egg, I’ll draw a raw egg on one side, labeling it 'Raw Egg'. Next to it, I’ll draw a cooked egg, which means I need to show it cracked open and solid inside, labeled 'Cooked Egg'. I know I need to include an arrow going from the raw egg to the cooked egg to show the cooking process, but I might forget to label it with 'heat'. Finally, I’ll include captions that mention 'Reversible Change' for the ice part and 'Irreversible Change' for the egg part.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed hand-drawn illustration that shows a science experiment about reversible and irreversible changes. On the left side, depict a block of ice labeled 'Ice', and next to it, a puddle labeled 'Water'. Include an arrow pointing from 'Water' back to 'Ice'. On the right side, draw a raw egg labeled 'Raw Egg', and next to it, a cooked egg with cracked shell, labeled 'Cooked Egg'. Use arrows between each state to indicate change, though arrows might not be labeled with 'heat' or 'cooling'. Add brief captions stating 'Reversible Change' near the ice drawings and 'Irreversible Change' near the egg drawings. Use simple, clear colors and a straightforward style to reflect a student's effort at a proficient level.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures what the student can do, such as drawing the initial and changed states for both examples and using arrows to demonstrate changes. It also includes labels for the different states, which the student is capable of. The prompt reflects where the student struggles, like possibly not labeling the process arrows (heat/cooling), as they might forget to reinforce how changes occur. Additionally, it considers the student's ability to correctly depict reversibility and irreversibility but recognizes their drawings might lack full scientific explanation."
