  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of materials before heating or cooling, like ice and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the change of these materials after heating, such as ice turning into water and a raw egg becoming a cooked egg.",
    "The student can show the change of these materials when the heating or cooling is reversed, like water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can use drawings to demonstrate which changes are reversible, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can depict which changes are irreversible, like a cooked egg not returning to a raw state.",
    "The student can create a visual representation of the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect it has on each material, showing observable patterns.",
    "The student can include evidence in their drawings to support the claim about reversibility or irreversibility of changes."
