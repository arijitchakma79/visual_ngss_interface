  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the initial state of materials before heating or cooling, such as ice and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the change of materials after heating, showing ice turning into water and a raw egg becoming a cooked egg.",
    "The student can show the change of water when cooling is reversed, depicting water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can use drawings to demonstrate that freezing water is a reversible change.",
    "The student can depict with reasonable accuracy that a cooked egg cannot be turned back into a raw egg, indicating irreversibility."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have minor inaccuracies in showing the cause (heating or cooling) for each change, or might not label all elements precisely (e.g., missing directional arrows for heat application).",
    "The student might include incomplete or ambiguous evidence in drawings to fully support claims about the reversibility or irreversibility of changes (e.g., not clearly illustrating why a change is irreversible)."
