  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student is likely able to draw an ice cube and a puddle of water, partially showing the melting process.",
    "The student may illustrate a raw egg and a cooked egg side by side to indicate a change occurred.",
    "The student can attempt to use arrows to indicate before and after states, sometimes inconsistently.",
    "The student might include some labels or descriptions showing some understanding of the changes occurring."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely mixes up reversible with irreversible changes, perhaps showing a cooked egg reverting to a raw egg *(misunderstands irreversibility)*.",
    "The student might not clearly depict the process of water freezing back into ice, or omit it altogether *(missing the reversible part of the cycle)*.",
    "Labels or descriptions may have gaps or inaccuracies, such as not explaining why the egg can't be uncooked *(lacks reasoning behind irreversible changes)*.",
    "Arrows or sequences in the drawing might be incorrect or missing, leading to confusion about the direction of changes *(inconsistent direction use)*."
