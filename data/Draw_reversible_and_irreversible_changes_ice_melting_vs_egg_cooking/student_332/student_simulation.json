  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw an ice cube melting into water and then show an egg being cooked to show changes. I'll start with the ice cube. I remember that melting is a change, so I'll draw a square for the ice and then beside it a puddle of water. I need arrows to show what is happening, so I'll draw an arrow from the ice cube to the water puddle. But, do I need to show the water changing back to ice? I think I'll skip that because it looks hard. Now for the egg, I know the egg changes when it cooks. I'll draw a raw egg, just an oval shape, and beside it a cooked egg, maybe with a yolk showing. I should put an arrow between them to show they are connected. Wait, does the cooked egg go back to being a raw egg? I'll draw an arrow back from the cooked egg to the raw egg, just in case. I should label them too. 'Ice' and 'Water' for the first part, and 'Raw Egg' and 'Cooked Egg' for the second. I'm not sure how to explain why the egg can't be uncooked, so I'll leave it to the drawings with arrows.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration on white paper showing two separate sections. On the left: An ice cube, drawn as a blue square, with a small puddle of blue water beside it; an arrow connects the ice cube to the puddle. There are simple labels in pencil indicating 'Ice' and 'Water'. On the right: Two eggs side by side; the first is an oval shape labeled 'Raw Egg' and the second is a fried egg, with a yellow yolk visible, labeled 'Cooked Egg'. Arrows are drawn between the eggs in both directions. The drawing is in pencil with color highlights for the ice and water, reflecting a child-like, beginner style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by showing an attempt to depict the melting of ice with arrows and labels. The inclusion of an arrow reverting a cooked egg back to a raw egg exposes misunderstanding of irreversibility. There is no depiction of water freezing back into ice, illustrating difficulty with capturing reversibility. The style is simplistic with some coloring, adhering to the Level 2 developing understanding."
