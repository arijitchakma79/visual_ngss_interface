  "Reasoning": "I’ll start with drawing an ice cube because I know ice is frozen water. I just picture a cube with some lines to show the edges. Now, I'll draw another shape beside it to show what happens when ice melts, but I’m not really sure how to show it's water, so I’ll just leave it kind of blobby. I think I should put an arrow between them to show they change. For the egg, I’ll draw an egg shape and then another shape to show it changes when it’s cooked, but I’m not exactly sure how to show cooked, so I’ll just make a wobbly shape next to it. I know these changes happen when we heat or cool things, but I’m not sure where to write words like 'heating' or 'cooling'.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing on paper. On one side, there is a rudimentary outline of an ice cube, with a nearby blob that represents melting ice, connected by an arrow. On the other side, there is a simple egg shape, with a vague shape next to it to show it cooked. No labels are present. Use basic colors like white for the ice cube, blue for melting ice, and yellowish-brown tones for the egg and changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's basic attempt to show states before and during change, but without the necessary labels or clarity to identify states post-change. By not labeling or accurately depicting post-heating states or the process of cooling, it aligns with the student's level where reversible and irreversible changes are not fully understood or correctly illustrated."
