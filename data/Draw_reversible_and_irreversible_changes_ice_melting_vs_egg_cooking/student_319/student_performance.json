  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can show a basic attempt to draw the material before it is heated or cooled, possibly drawing an ice cube or an egg with minimal detail.",
    "The student may attempt to draw a liquid form to suggest ice melts into water, but may not label it or show it clearly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely cannot accurately illustrate or label the change post-heating, such as ice turning into water; they might draw an arrow without showing states (*unclear or no understanding of state change*).",
    "The student may not illustrate water returning to ice, or if they do, it may lack clarity or be incorrectly labeled (*doesn't realize that cooling can reverse melting*).",
    "The student does not show an understanding of irreversible changes, like egg cooking; drawings may lack distinction between raw and cooked states.",
    "They cannot correctly label causes of the changes such as 'heating' or 'cooling', potentially misunderstanding these processes (*doesn't connect heating with change in state*).",
    "The student is not able to represent an argument about whether changes are reversible or irreversible, as they may not understand these concepts clearly."
