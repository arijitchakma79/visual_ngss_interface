  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start with drawing the original states of the materials. For the ice cube, I'll sketch a well-defined, translucent cube, maybe with some light blue shading to show it’s cold. Then I'll draw a raw egg, making it slightly oval and white, with some lines to hint at the shell’s texture. Next, I'll illustrate what happens when these materials are heated. The melted ice will be a puddle of clear water next to the cube, and I'll use light blue to show that the water is still cold. For the egg, I'll draw it broken in a pan, with the yolk and white cooked – the yolk is yellow and the egg white is now a slightly tan color. I'll then show the ice reversing back to a solid state by drawing an arrow pointing from the water back to another ice cube, indicating the process of freezing. I need to label this as 'Reversible'. Lastly, for the cooked egg, I'll emphasize with an arrow and a label 'Irreversible', showing that it can't go back to a raw egg. I might forget one or two arrows or labels, perhaps overlooking a part of the water. I should try to keep scale in mind, but I might make the egg slightly bigger than the ice cube by mistake.",
  "Prompt": "Drawings of reversible and irreversible changes: Show a detailed ice cube melting into water, with light blue coloring to indicate cold. Draw an arrow and label 'Reversible' as the water turns back into ice. Illustrate a raw egg with an intact shell, and next to it a cooked egg with the yolk yellow and whites slightly tan. Use an arrow to label 'Irreversible' for the cooked egg. Drawings should be clear and detailed, with some minor labels or arrows possibly missing. Use basic colors for accuracy.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's strengths in accurately representing the original and altered states of materials and showing processes with arrows and labels. It also aligns with potential mistakes like missing arrows, minor omissions in labeling, and scale inconsistencies, such as slightly fluctuating sizes. The inclusion of basic colors helps visualize the coldness of ice and the transition of states clearly."
