  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the original state of a material, such as a whole ice cube and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate with detail what the material looks like after it has been heated or cooled, like showing melted water from an ice cube and a well-cooked egg.",
    "The student can show that ice melting is reversible by drawing the reverse process, such as refreezing water back into ice.",
    "The student can effectively depict that the change in a cooked egg cannot be reversed and remains in the cooked state.",
    "The student can use arrows or symbols to indicate cause and effect, clearly showing how heating or cooling impacts the materials.",
    "The student can use labels or captions accurately explaining whether the change in their drawings is reversible or irreversible."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit labels or arrows in minor parts of their drawing (may overlook labeling a small section or forget an arrow but mostly accurate).",
    "The student might show slight inconsistencies in scale or proportion in some elements of the drawing (e.g., the size of the egg might slightly fluctuate or water may not appear in scale with the cube)."
