  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of ice before and after heating, showing it melting into water and refreezing back into ice.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the concept that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed, using ice melting and refreezing as an example.",
    "The student can demonstrate cause and effect with illustrations showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes, such as ice melting and eggs cooking.",
    "The student can use drawings to make a claim and provide evidence that not all changes are reversible, partially showing this idea with the example of a cooked egg."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have minor gaps or incomplete labeling, such as not clearly illustrating the process of refreezing.",
    "The student may partially misunderstand or inconsistently show why the cooked egg cannot return to its raw state when cooled, possibly omitting explanation details or labeling inconsistencies.",
    "The student might slightly inaccurately label some aspects in the drawing of the raw and cooked egg, lacking clarity without fully explaining the irreversible process."
