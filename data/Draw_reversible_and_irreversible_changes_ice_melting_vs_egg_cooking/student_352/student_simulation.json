  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two panels side by side. On the first panel, I’ll draw a solid block of ice. I remember that ice is cold and solid, so I’ll make sure to label it as 'Ice - Solid' and maybe add some icicles to show it’s frozen. Next, I’ll show that heating the ice turns it into water by drawing water droplets around the ice as it melts. I’ll label this as 'Melting - Liquid Water' and draw an arrow showing the change from ice to water. For the reversible part, I’ll draw another arrow pointing back to the ice from the water with the label 'Freezing - Solid Ice'. This shows that if water is cooled, it can become ice again. Now, for the second panel, I’ll draw an uncooked egg on the left, showing it as white with a visible yellow yolk and label it 'Raw Egg'. Then, I’ll draw the egg in a frying pan with steam lines rising to indicate it’s cooking. I need to ensure it looks different once cooked, so I'll change the egg white to opaque and label it as 'Cooked Egg'. To show this change is irreversible, I'll draw a crossed arrow from the cooked egg back to the raw egg without any further labeling. I’m sure I've included most parts, though I might not show every small detail about why the egg change is irreversible or perfectly label all parts clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Create a split panel drawing. On the left panel, show a block of ice with icicles and label it 'Ice - Solid'. Draw water droplets around it and label them 'Melting - Liquid Water', with an arrow indicating the change from ice to water. Add another arrow pointing from 'Liquid Water' back to 'Ice - Solid' and label it 'Freezing - Solid Ice'. On the right panel, draw a raw egg with a visible yolk labeled 'Raw Egg'. Next, draw it in a frying pan with steam lines and label it 'Cooked Egg'. Add a crossed arrow from the cooked egg to the raw egg, showing irreversibility. Use pencil sketch style with color in blue for ice and water, and white and yellow for the egg.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate and label the reversible process of ice melting and freezing. It includes the effect of heating and cooling, demonstrating the changes effectively. However, the very same prompt shows the student's struggles in clarifying the irreversible nature of a cooked egg, suggesting slight inaccuracies and label inconsistencies."
