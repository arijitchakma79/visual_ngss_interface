  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of ice before and after heating (melting into water) and after cooling (freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can draw and label the characteristics of a raw egg before and after heating (cooking into a solid form) and explain why cooling does not reverse this change.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the idea that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed, like ice melting and refreezing.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the idea that some changes are irreversible, like a cooked egg not returning to its raw state.",
    "The student can demonstrate cause and effect by showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes in materials.",
    "The student can use drawings to support the claim that not all changes are reversible, using evidence from their illustrations.",
    "The student can show in their drawings how patterns of reversible and irreversible changes can be observed through experiments with heat and cooling."
