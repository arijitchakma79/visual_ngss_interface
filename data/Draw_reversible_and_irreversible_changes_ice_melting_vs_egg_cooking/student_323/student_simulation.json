  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a picture about how ice melting is different from an egg cooking. I think I'll start by drawing ice. I'll just make a square shape for ice, maybe with a few lines to show it's cold. I'll label it as 'ice' even though I don't always remember to label things. Next, I'll draw what happens when the ice melts, which I think is just water, so I’ll draw some wavy lines next to the ice. I want to show that the ice turned into water, but I’m not sure how to label that. I’ll leave it as it is. For the egg, I'll just draw an oval shape and label it 'egg'. I know eggs change when you cook them, so I'll draw another oval with maybe some lines like steam, to show it’s being cooked, though I’m not sure how that’s different from melting the ice. I’ll skip drawing how ice can become ice again, because I'm not sure how that works.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn, child-like sketch showing a large, roughly drawn square labeled 'ice' in blue, next to wavy blue lines labeled 'water' representing melting ice. Nearby is a roughly drawn oval labeled 'egg' in yellow, plus another oval with squiggly lines above it attempting to show the egg being cooked, suggesting the concept of change. The drawing lacks clear labels or detailed transitions between states. The overall style is simplistic and colorful, using a few basic colors like blue for ice and yellow for the egg.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt describes a drawing that includes elements the student can do, like attempting to show ice and water and labeling some parts. It avoids what the student struggles with, such as accurately representing the transition (like refreezing ice) or fully understanding changes in state. Labels are minimal and potentially incorrect, in line with the student not fully grasping the task’s complexity."
