  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw ice and an egg in some initial state (e.g., draws a box labeled 'ice' and a circle labeled 'egg').",
    "The student might show an element of change, such as drawing separate pictures for 'before' and 'after', though not necessarily with correct details (e.g., separate sketches for ice and water without clear labels)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly label materials before heating or cooling (e.g., ice not labeled, or labels incorrectly applied).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate or understand the concept of change or state changes (e.g., no distinction between solid ice and liquid water).",
    "The student may not show or misunderstand reversibility, omitting or incorrectly representing the reversal process (e.g., only shows melted water, not refreezing).",
    "The student may not accurately illustrate cause and effect (e.g., no indication that heating causes cooking, or that cooling refreezes ice).",
    "The student is unlikely to include labels or captions describing the changes or indicating reversibility (e.g., lacks descriptive text entirely or describes incorrectly)."
