  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice in a solid state, a raw egg in its liquid state).",
    "The student can draw and label the material after it has been heated or cooled, indicating the change in state (e.g., ice becoming water, a raw egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can visually represent whether the change is reversible by showing the reverse process (e.g., water refreezing into ice) or not (e.g., a cooked egg not returning to a raw state).",
    "The student can illustrate the concept of cause and effect by showing how heating or cooling leads to changes in the material.",
    "The student can include labels or captions that describe the changes observed and indicate whether they are reversible or irreversible."
