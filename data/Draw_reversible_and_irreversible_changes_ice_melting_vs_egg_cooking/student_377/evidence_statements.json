  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before and after heating, showing the change (e.g., ice becomes water, an egg becomes solid).",
    "The student can draw the same material after cooling (reversal attempt), showing if the change is reversible or not (e.g., water becomes ice again, cooked egg does not become raw again).",
    "The student can highlight in their drawing whether the change is reversible (e.g., water to ice and back) or irreversible (e.g., egg once cooked cannot return to raw).",
    "The student can illustrate cause and effect by showing how heating or cooling is the cause and the resulting change is the effect.",
    "The student can demonstrate their reasoning through the sequence of drawings showing the reversal of changes or the permanence of irreversible changes (e.g., showing the process of ice melting and refreezing vs. egg cooking and not reverting)."
