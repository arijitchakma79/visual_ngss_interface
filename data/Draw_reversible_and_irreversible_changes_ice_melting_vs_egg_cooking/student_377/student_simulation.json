  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing an ice cube in its solid state on the left side of the page. I remember that when ice is heated, it melts into water, so I’ll draw a small arrow pointing to a puddle of water next to the ice cube. This shows the process of melting. I know that if I cool the water, it can freeze back into ice, so I'll draw another arrow pointing from the water back to another ice cube, indicating that this is reversible. I will label the arrows as 'heating' and 'cooling' to clarify these changes. For the egg, I’ll draw a raw egg on one side. I remember that cooking makes the egg solid, so I'll create an arrow labeled 'heating' pointing to a cooked egg. I know that cooking the egg is irreversible, so I’ll make sure this is clear in my drawing. Oops, I might forget to explicitly label 'reversible' or 'irreversible,' but I’ll make sure the arrows show what I mean. Time to sketch!",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed and educational science diagram with two sequences. On the left, depict a solid ice cube transforming into a puddle of water with an arrow labeled 'heating,' and a second arrow labeled 'cooling' going from the water back to another ice cube, symbolizing the reversible process. On the right, draw a raw egg with an arrow labeled 'heating' pointing to a cooked egg, emphasizing the irreversible change. Use clear labels and vivid colors like blue for ice/water and yellow for the egg yolk, with the overall style being a neat and clear educational sketch for students.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate the reversible process of ice melting and refreezing, using clear arrows and labels for heating and cooling. It also highlights the irreversible cooking of an egg with labeled arrows. Despite a minor omission of explicit labels for 'reversible' or 'irreversible,' the arrows and states provide enough context to convey understanding. The color choices and clear style align with the student's advanced capability to create a complete and understandable representation."
