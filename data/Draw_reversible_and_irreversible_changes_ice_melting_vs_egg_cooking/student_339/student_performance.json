  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the starting materials before any change, like an ice cube and a raw egg, with basic accuracy.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, such as melted water and a cooked egg, but may show simplified or basic representations.",
    "The student may attempt to show whether the change is reversible or not, such as water that can freeze again, but with partial accuracy in the depiction.",
    "The student can include some form of symbols like arrows to indicate heating or cooling processes, though placement may be inconsistent."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes in both scenarios (e.g., may show a cooked egg as reversible).",
    "The student might not accurately illustrate the state of the material after cooling, like water freezing back into ice, or might omit parts of the process.",
    "The student may neglect or improperly label drawings with all relevant keywords, possibly missing terms like 'liquid water' or 'cooked egg'.",
    "The student might confuse process order, such as incorrectly associating cooling with melting instead of freezing."
