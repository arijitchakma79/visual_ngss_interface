  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting material, before any heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw the material after it is heated, showing the change (e.g., melted water from ice, cooked egg from raw egg).",
    "The student can show in their drawing whether the change is reversible (e.g., melting ice can be frozen back to ice) or not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg cannot return to its raw state).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it undergoes cooling and describe the change (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can represent whether the cooling change is reversible or irreversible (e.g., frozen water can melt again, but a cooled cooked egg can't turn back into a raw egg).",
    "The student can include arrows or symbols to show the process of heating and cooling and any reverse changes.",
    "The student can label their drawings with keywords to describe the state of the material (e.g., ice, liquid water, raw egg, cooked egg)."
