  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing an ice cube on one side and a raw egg on the other. I remember that ice is supposed to melt, so I'll draw some blue-colored liquid water next to it. I'll draw an arrow pointing from the ice cube to the water to show that it melted because of heat. Then, I'll try drawing the egg after it's cooked with brownish-yellow lines to indicate it's fried. I think it's important to show that, so I'll add a wavy arrow from the raw egg to the cooked egg. I also remember that melted water is reversible, so I'll try drawing ice again with an arrow pointing back, but I'm not sure if it makes sense. I should add labels but I'm a bit uncertain about what to write, maybe just 'ice', 'water', 'raw egg', and 'cooked egg'. I might mix up some of the labels though.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple diagram with a childish style using crayon-like colors. On the left, draw a blue ice cube and label it 'ice'. Next to it, draw blue liquid water and label it 'water', with an arrow pointing from the ice to the water. Then, draw a brown raw egg and label it 'raw egg'. Next to it, draw a yellow and brown cooked egg and label it 'cooked egg', with a wavy arrow pointing from the raw to the cooked egg. Include an attempt of an arrow pointing back from the water to the ice to show reversibility.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's ability to draw basic elements like an ice cube and raw egg with some accuracy. It reflects their attempt to show changes with arrows, although inconsistently, as well as partial attempts at labeling, highlighting their emerging understanding and developing skills."
