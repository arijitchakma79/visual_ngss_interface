  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a simple diagram of ice turning into water, indicating a change in state from solid to liquid, but may struggle to clearly illustrate or explain the refreezing process.",
    "The student can draw an egg being cooked, showing the transition from liquid to solid, but with basic visual representations and limited detail.",
    "The student can start to illustrate basic characteristics of materials, such as ice being solid before heating and water being liquid after, though details might be simplified or lacking."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not effectively illustrate the complete cycle of melting and refreezing ice back into its solid state (student might forget to show refreezing).",
    "The student might not clearly represent the irreversibility of a cooked egg beyond showing it as solid (student may think both processes are reversible).",
    "The student is likely unable to accurately label all steps in their drawings to explain whether changes are reversible or irreversible, possibly due to a limited understanding of the terms or concepts.",
    "The student might show some cause-and-effect patterns but may inconsistently apply this across different parts of the drawing (e.g., correct for melting but not for cooking)."
