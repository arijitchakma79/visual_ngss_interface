  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a diagram showing the process of ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice, illustrating a reversible change.",
    "The student can draw a diagram of an egg being cooked to show how it changes from a liquid to a solid, illustrating an irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of materials before and after heating or cooling, such as ice being solid before heating and water being liquid after.",
    "The student can visually represent the irreversibility of a cooked egg, showing that it cannot turn back into a raw egg once cooked.",
    "The student can create a drawing that identifies cause and effect patterns by showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes in the materials.",
    "The student can label their drawings to explain if the changes are reversible or irreversible, using simple terms and symbols."
