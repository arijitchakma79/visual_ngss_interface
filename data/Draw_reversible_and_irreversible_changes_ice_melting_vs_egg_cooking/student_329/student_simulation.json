  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a piece of ice. I know that ice is solid, so I'll make a square shape with lines to show it like a cube. Now, I need to show it turning into water, so I'll draw some water droplets next to the ice. I remember that when ice melts, it turns into liquid water. Oh, I also need to think about refreezing but, hmm, that's hard for me to remember, so I'll just skip that part. Now, for the egg, I'll draw it looking like an egg shape, and then I'll draw some steam to show it's being cooked. After cooking, the egg becomes a solid, so I need to draw it as a solid blob. I think the egg stays like that forever, but wait, it might be possible to turn it back; I’m not sure. I’ll draw simple arrows for changes. My details are basic, and I might label some parts like 'solid' and 'liquid' beside the ice, but I'm not sure where else.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing depicting a process of ice changing from solid to liquid with an ice cube turning into water droplets through basic lines and shapes, no refreezing shown. An egg cooking depicted with an egg shape with steam lines above it and turning into a solid shape. The style is hand-drawn pencil sketch with minimal detail, and only some arrows and basic labels like 'solid' and 'liquid'. Colors are muted with ice in blue and egg in yellow tones.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to show basic changes from solid to liquid and liquid to solid, though the refreezing step for ice is not shown, and the student might think the egg's change is reversible. The drawing follows the description of a developing level where basic elements are present, but details and understanding are lacking, matched with the simple drawing style and limited labeling."
