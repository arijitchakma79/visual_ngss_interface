  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube. I think ice cubes are square, so I’ll draw a simple square to represent an ice cube. Now, I’ll try to show it melting. I guess melting means it turns into water, so I’ll draw some squiggly lines next to the ice cube for water, but I’m not sure how to show that it can freeze back into an ice cube later. Next, I’ll draw an egg which I think is round, so I’ll draw a small circle for a raw egg. I’ve seen eggs cooked in a pan, so I’ll draw the egg in a frying pan with a squiggly line to show maybe it is cooking. I remember something about using arrows, but I’m not sure where they should go, so I’ll add one randomly next to the pan. I won't label anything since I’m not quite sure how to or what goes where. It’s hard to show which changes are reversible or not. Now I’m done, but it doesn’t look like the changes over time, especially the cooked egg, can ever turn back into a raw egg.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple hand-drawn image showing a square ice cube on the left with some squiggly lines next to it representing water. To the right, draw a small circle as a raw egg and then draw a frying pan below it with a squiggly line on it to represent cooking. Include one arrow poorly placed next to the frying pan, not clearly showing direction or process. Use basic colors: light blue for ice, white for the egg, and a grey frying pan. The style is simplistic and lacks detail, as a beginner student might draw.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including simple shapes like a square for the ice cube and a circle for the egg, reflecting the student's ability to attempt initial states of materials. It also captures their struggles by not clearly distinguishing reversible from irreversible changes, having misplaced arrows, and lacking proper labels. This aligns with the student's differentiated understanding and limited depiction of scientific processes as described in their level."
