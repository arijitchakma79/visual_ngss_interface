  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw an initial state of the materials, such as an ice cube and an egg, but the drawings might be simplistic or lack detail.",
    "The student may include basic illustrations of ice turning into water or an egg in a pan, but these illustrations might not clearly show the change due to heating."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to correctly depict or indicate that ice melting into water is a reversible change and may show no distinction between reversible and irreversible changes (student doesnâ€™t understand reversible changes).",
    "The student might not include any symbols like arrows that show the cause-and-effect relationship of heating or cooling, or uses them incorrectly or inconsistently (student is unaware of or misunderstands the role of symbols).",
    "The student may not attempt to label or incorrectly label parts of the drawing, such as drawing cooked eggs turning back into raw eggs potentially (misunderstands irreversible change).",
    "The drawing might not clearly show changes over time such as water turning back into ice or may incorrectly depict changes (e.g., ice doesn't refreeze)."
