  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing how some materials change (e.g., ice turns to water, egg becomes cooked).",
    "The student can depict whether the change is reversible or not by drawing the material cooling and what happens (e.g., water turning back to ice, cooked egg staying solid).",
    "The student can identify and label parts of the drawing that show reversible changes (e.g., melting ice to water and refreezing) and irreversible changes (e.g., cooked egg).",
    "The student can use arrows or other symbols in their drawing to show the cause-and-effect relationship of heating and cooling on the materials."
