  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a block of ice because I remember that ice can melt into water when it gets heated. I'll make sure to draw it as a light blue rectangle to show it's ice and label it 'ice'. Now, I need to show the ice melting, so I'll add a puddle underneath it. I almost forgot to label that as 'water'. I'm not sure how to show the water turning back into ice; I remember my teacher mentioned something about cooling, but I'm stuck here. For the egg, I’ll draw an egg in a pan to show it being cooked. I'll start with a whole egg and next to it, I'll draw a solid egg with some yellow and white after cooking, labeled 'cooked egg'. I know the egg doesn't turn back to its original form when it's cooked, but I'm not sure how to show that in my drawing. I'll draw these parts with some arrows between them, hoping it shows the change over time, even if I'm not sure about the sequences.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple illustration with two main parts. On the left, draw a large light blue rectangle labeled 'ice' with a puddle of water underneath it labeled 'water'. Next to this, draw an egg in a pan, with an arrow pointing to a cooked egg, which is half yellow and half white, labeled 'cooked egg'. Use a basic drawing style, like colored pencils, with simple labels and arrows to indicate changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by illustrating ice melting into water, which they understand and attempt to label, although they forget some labels and steps. The task shows understanding that a cooked egg doesn't reverse back, but the drawing lacks detail in showing these concepts accurately and doesn't depict the water turning back into ice, which aligns with the struggles described."
