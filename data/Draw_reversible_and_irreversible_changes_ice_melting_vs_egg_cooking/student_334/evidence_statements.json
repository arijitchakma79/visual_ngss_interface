  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label a picture showing a material that is changing due to heating, such as ice melting into water.",
    "The student can draw and label a picture showing the cooling process and how water can turn back into ice.",
    "The student can illustrate and label a material after heating that cannot be reversed by cooling, such as a cooked egg staying solid.",
    "The student can visually represent the initial and final characteristics of a material before and after heating or cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change is reversible or irreversible in the drawing.",
    "The student can indicate through the drawing how some heating or cooling changes are connected by cause and effect, showing the observable patterns."
