  "Reasoning": "I want to draw the changes of ice melting and freezing because that's reversible. First, I'll draw an ice cube on one side, then a puddle of water on the other side. I'll use arrows to show ice melting into water and back to ice. I'll try to label the changes, like 'melting' and 'freezing', but I might miss labeling the temperatures exactly. Next, I'll draw an egg being cooked, which is irreversible. I'll show a raw egg, then an arrow to a cooked egg. I won’t include details at the molecular level, but I’ll focus on how once it's cooked, it can’t go back. I’ll emphasize this by not putting an arrow back to the raw state.",
  "Prompt": "The image shows two side-by-side scenes. On the left, an ice cube sits on a surface, gradually melting into a puddle of water. An arrow labeled 'melting' points from the ice cube to the water puddle. Another arrow labeled 'freezing' returns from the puddle to an ice cube. On the right, a raw egg is shown beside a frying pan, then an arrow leads to a cooked egg in the pan. The contrasting scenes are depicted in a cartoon style with vibrant colors. The ice is a light blue, the water puddle is transparent bluish, and the arrows are bold and red. The egg shell is white, and the cooked egg is shown with bright yellow yolk.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately show reversible and irreversible changes. The inclusion of before and after states with arrows highlights understanding of change paths. However, the prompt omits precise temperature labels, reflecting the student's noted struggles. The cartoon drawing style aligns with the student's level, showcasing both effort and minor readable details."
