  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately illustrate ice melting into water and water freezing back into ice, with clear before and after states.",
    "The student can depict the irreversible change of a raw egg being cooked into a solid state, clearly showing both before and after the change.",
    "The student can provide detailed drawings that describe reversible changes, like the cycle of freezing and melting of ice, and contrast them with irreversible changes, such as a cooked egg not reverting to its raw state.",
    "The student can show the effects of heating and cooling on materials within their drawings, correctly identifying the cause of changes in state.",
    "The student can include cause-and-effect evidence in their drawings, clearly explaining patterns of reversible and irreversible changes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally miss minor details, such as not consistently labeling temperature changes or forgetting arrows to indicate direction of change *(sometimes labels are incomplete)*.",
    "The student might inconsistency in showing advanced concepts, like the detailed molecular level explanation of the changes *(attempts detailed features without full success)*."
