  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate an object changing state by heating, such as ice melting into water, including both before and after the change.",
    "The student can illustrate an object changing state by cooling, such as water freezing into ice, including both before and after the change.",
    "The student can depict an irreversible change by heating, like a raw egg cooking and turning into a solid, showing both before and after the change.",
    "The student can describe through drawings which changes are reversible (e.g., ice can freeze and melt in cycles) and which are irreversible (e.g., a cooked egg cannot return to a raw state).",
    "The student can show the effects of heating and cooling on different materials and identify the cause of the changes in state.",
    "The student can include cause-and-effect evidence in their drawings that explains patterns like reversible and irreversible changes."
