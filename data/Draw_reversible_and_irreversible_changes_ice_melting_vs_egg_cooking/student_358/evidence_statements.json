  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., an ice cube or a raw egg).",
    "The student can depict the state of the material after it is heated (e.g., the ice cube melting into water, a raw egg solidifying when cooked).",
    "The student can represent whether the change is reversible by including an illustration of the material returning to its initial state (e.g., melted water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate that some changes are irreversible through drawings showing that the material does not return to its initial state (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can show cause and effect by illustrating how heating or cooling causes observable changes in the materials."
