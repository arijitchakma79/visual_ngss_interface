{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of a material before heating or cooling, showing an ice cube and a raw egg.",
    "The student can depict the state of the material after it is heated, with the ice cube melting into water and the raw egg solidifying into a cooked egg.",
    "The student can demonstrate that the melting of ice is a reversible change by drawing melted water refreezing into an ice cube.",
    "The student can show cause and effect by illustrating how heating causes observable changes in the materials (e.g., drawing heat lines or an oven to indicate cooking)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently depict irreversible changes, perhaps by suggesting a cooked egg can return to its raw state through cooling (misapplication of reversibility).",
    "The student might show minor gaps, such as not fully labeling stages or missing arrows indicating the direction of change in some parts of the diagram."
