  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its original characteristics (e.g., ice as solid, egg as liquid).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, demonstrating the change that occurred (e.g., melted ice as water, cooked egg as solid).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change is reversible by showing the material after cooling (e.g., water freezing back to ice, cooked egg remaining solid).",
    "The student can draw a comparison of the material's characteristics before and after to identify patterns of reversibility (e.g., ice returns to its original state, egg does not).",
    "The student can use visual elements to depict the cause and effect of heating or cooling on each material."
