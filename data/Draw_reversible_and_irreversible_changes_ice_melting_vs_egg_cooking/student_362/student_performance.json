  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice as a solid before heating and as water after melting, clearly showing the phase change.",
    "The student can depict the egg as a liquid before heating and as solid after cooking, showing an irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate water freezing back into ice by using arrows or labels to indicate the reversibility of the ice melting process.",
    "The student can somewhat effectively compare the characteristics of ice and water before and after melting using visual differences like shading or texture."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label the changes, sometimes omitting labels or arrows for clarity (e.g., missing labels that indicate 'melting' or 'cooking').",
    "The student's drawing might not clearly distinguish between reversible and irreversible changes if it lacks distinct comparative elements for the egg (e.g., not showing clearly why the cooked egg doesn't revert to a liquid).",
    "The student may occasionally misunderstand or not depict the initial liquid state of the egg accurately, showing an egg with vague or unclear characteristics before heating."
