  "Reasoning": "Okay, let me start with the ice cube. I'll draw a solid ice cube first. I remember ice is kind of clear and has some edges. Next to it, I'll draw a puddle of water to show that the ice has melted. I remember that this is a reversible change, so I'll draw an arrow going back from the puddle to the ice cube, and I might label it 'melting' to be clear. Now, for the egg, I have to show it as a liquid first. I think I'll draw an egg out of its shell, with runny white and yolk. Then, next to it, I'll draw a cooked egg with solid white and yolk. To show this change isn't reversible, I think I should draw an 'X' or something to make it clear that it can't go back to being liquid, though I might forget to label this. I need to make sure the melted ice can be clear and with little droplets for the puddle, and the cooked egg should look different with a solid texture. I think shading or rough lines might help with the cooked egg, but I'll try to make it obvious that the egg change can't reverse back by making the cooked egg blocky and solid. I might forget some labels or not be super clear, but hope the differences come across.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two sequences side by side. On the left, show an ice cube drawn with faint blue and white color, having sharp edges, next to a round blue puddle of water with a reversible arrow between them, labeled 'melting'. On the right, depict a raw egg with a light yellow yolk and white next to a cooked egg with solid whites and a yellow center, using thicker outlines and shading, crossed out with a red 'X' symbol. The style should be cartoonish and bright, focusing on distinct textures and colors for the reversible and irreversible changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what I can do because I include visual elements like arrows for the reversible change and the different textures for the egg states. My struggle to label or clearly indicate irreversibility is shown with a simple 'X' marking. It reflects my proficiency by focusing on distinct stages and colors throughout the processes. The drawing style aligns with my proficiency level as I make an effort to depict these changes, even if some aspects like labels or details aren't perfect."
