  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a scenario showing ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice, demonstrating a reversible change.",
    "The student can represent a cooked egg that remains solid and cannot return to its raw form, demonstrating an irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of a material before and after heating or cooling, such as showing ice, water, and then ice again.",
    "The student can show the effect of heating on a raw egg, turning it into a cooked egg, emphasizing that this change is permanent.",
    "The student can include labels or notes in the drawing to specify which changes are reversible and which are not, with simple explanations or arrows indicating the process.",
    "The student can indicate the cause and effect in the drawing, such as how heating or cooling leads to certain observable changes."
