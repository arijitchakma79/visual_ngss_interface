  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice melting into water, showing a reversible change, but may not include the re-freezing process or may sketch it unclearly.",
    "The student can depict a cooked egg as different from a raw egg, suggesting an irreversible change, but might not articulate why it cannot go back to raw.",
    "The student may attempt to illustrate changes over time, like ice turning into water, but might not show each phase distinctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to fully describe the process of re-freezing water into ice with accuracy or may omit this step entirely (student doesn't recognize or represent this step).",
    "The student often fails to label the changes as reversible or irreversible in a clear manner (labels might be missing or confused).",
    "The student might not indicate cause and effect, such as how heating leads to certain changes, or might get the directions wrong (e.g., showing ice melting due to unspecified reasons)."
