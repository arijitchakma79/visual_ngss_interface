  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice on the left side of the paper, making it look solid with jagged edges to show that it's cold. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle of water to show it has melted. I'll make the water look liquid and label this part as 'ice melting'. I'll remember to draw another arrow from the puddle going back to a block of ice, showing the water freezing again, and label it 'freezing'. Now, for the egg, I'll draw a raw egg on the left with a label as 'raw egg'. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing to a frying pan with an egg in it, labeling this as 'egg cooking'. Finally, I'll draw the cooked egg outside the pan and label it 'cooked egg'. I might forget to add an arrow or label the cooling process, and I need to be careful not to imply that the cooked egg can go back to being raw.",
  "Prompt": "A colored pencil drawing showing two sequences. On the left, a block of blue ice, with jagged edges, with an arrow pointing to a blue puddle of water labeled 'ice melting'. Another arrow leads from the water back to ice labeled 'freezing'. On the right, a brown and white raw egg with an arrow pointing to a frying pan with a white and yellow egg in it labeled 'egg cooking'. An arrow points to the cooked egg outside the pan labeled 'cooked egg'. Some labels may look slightly incomplete or missing arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures both what I can and cannot do. Iâ€™m good at showing reversible changes like ice to water to ice but need help with labeling every stage. For the egg, I illustrate the cooking process but might imply reversibility, which is a common mistake."
