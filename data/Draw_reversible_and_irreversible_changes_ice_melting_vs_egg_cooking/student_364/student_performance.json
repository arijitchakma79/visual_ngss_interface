  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a material before and after it is heated, clearly showing its characteristics, such as a solid block of ice before heating and water after heating.",
    "The student can draw the process of ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice, showing a reversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate a raw egg before cooking and a cooked egg after heating, indicating an irreversible change.",
    "The student can label the stages in the drawings to support whether changes are reversible or irreversible, although some labels may be missing or partially incorrect."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may incompletely label each stage, occasionally missing key factors, such as forgetting to label a stage as 'cooling' or 'reheating'.",
    "The student might oversimplify the cause and effect of heating and cooling, omitting arrows or transition details that show how the ice becomes water or how an egg is cooked. (student tries but might miss the step-by-step process)",
    "The student might inconsistently show the permanence of irreversible changes, such as not indicating that the cooked egg does not return to a raw state. (student might imply it's reversible by mistake)"
