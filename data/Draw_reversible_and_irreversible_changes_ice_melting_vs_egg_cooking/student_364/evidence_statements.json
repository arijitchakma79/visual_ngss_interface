  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before and after it is heated, clearly showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can draw the same material after it is cooled or reheated, showing whether it returns to its original state or not.",
    "The student can represent changes that are reversible by showing a process, such as ice melting into water and freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can represent changes that are irreversible, such as a raw egg being cooked and staying solid, even after cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate the cause and effect of heating and cooling visually, using observable patterns.",
    "The student can clearly label each stage in the drawing to support an argument about whether changes are reversible or irreversible."
