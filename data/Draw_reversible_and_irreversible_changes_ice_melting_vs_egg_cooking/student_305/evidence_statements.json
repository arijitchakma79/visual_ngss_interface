  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture showing what a piece of ice looks like before it melts and what it looks like after it has melted into water.",
    "The student can draw the water being cooled back into ice, showing the reversible change.",
    "The student can draw an egg before it is cooked and show what it looks like after it is cooked to demonstrate an irreversible change.",
    "The student can show the process of an egg being cooked and describe that it cannot be turned back into a raw egg through cooling.",
    "The student can clearly indicate which changes are reversible and which are irreversible in their drawing.",
    "The student can draw and label the process of changes (e.g., ice melting, water freezing, egg cooking) to show cause and effect."
