  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube. I know it's just a block, so I'll make a box shape. I’ve seen that ice melts, but I’m not sure how to show it changes to water, so I’ll leave the water part out. I’ll also draw an egg next to the ice cube. I’ll try to make the egg look round like an oval, and I think it’s all one piece so I won’t show what happens when it cooks. The egg might look the same before and after cooking, but I guess it doesn't change much. I’m not sure about showing how these change with heat or labeling anything, so I'll just leave them like this.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple pencil sketch of an ice cube next to an egg. The ice cube is a basic square or rectangular shape. The egg is an oval shape. Do not show water, melting, or cooking process details. No labels or cause and effect shown. Use minimal shading to suggest beginner drawing skills. The background should be plain.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt accurately reflects the student's level since it includes a minimal understanding of the processes. The ice cube and egg are drawn but without any context or changes shown, matching their inability to depict reversible and irreversible processes or differentiate between them. The lack of labels and simplistic style also align with the student's described capabilities."
