{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a substance before and after heating, such as ice turning into water, and an egg turning solid when cooked.",
    "The student can demonstrate through drawing whether the change is reversible, like water freezing back into ice, or irreversible, like a cooked egg remaining solid.",
    "The student can show the cause and effect of heating by depicting the observable patterns, such as melting ice and a cooked egg.",
    "The student can identify a material that changes when cooled, like melted chocolate solidifying, and illustrate whether the change is reversible, showing chocolate becoming solid in a different shape.",
    "The student can use reasoning in their drawing to support a claim about reversible changes, such as ice melting and refreezing, and irreversible changes, such as a cooked egg not turning back into a raw egg."
