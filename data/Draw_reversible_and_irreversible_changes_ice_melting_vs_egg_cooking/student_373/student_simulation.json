  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube on the left side of the page. Ice cubes are clear, but I’ll shade them lightly in blue to show that they’re cold and solid. Next to it, I’ll draw a puddle of water to show what happens when the ice melts. I’ll add an arrow going from the ice cube to the water to indicate the change. To show it’s reversible, I’ll draw another arrow going from the water back to the ice cube. Now, for the egg, I’ll draw a raw egg in a pan on the right side. I want to make sure the egg is clearly liquid, so I’ll use yellow and white to show the yolk and egg white before they’re cooked. Next, I’ll show the cooked egg by drawing it again in the pan, this time all solid and a little raised in the middle, using darker yellows and whites. I should show it can’t go back to being liquid by drawing a crossed-out arrow from the cooked egg to the raw one. To make it clear that heat causes these changes, I’ll draw little lines to indicate steam above the melting ice and a stove under the pan with the egg. Oops, I almost forgot—the melted chocolate! I’ll skip it for now since I’m not sure how to show it changing back to solid. Finally, I’ll make sure to label everything, although I might miss one or two, like forgetting to label that the ice is refrozen if I get distracted.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two panels. In the first panel on the left, illustrate an ice cube with a slight blue hue melting into a puddle of water. Include arrows showing the change from ice to water and back, describing it as reversible. In the second panel on the right, depict a raw egg in a frying pan, using white and yellow to differentiate the yolk and white. Next to it, draw the egg after cooking, solid and slightly raised, with a crossed-out arrow indicating it cannot revert to raw. Include lines of steam rising from the melting ice and a stove under the egg to suggest heating effects. Use a clear and bold drawing style with accurate labels, but leave out details for melted chocolate.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency by accurately depicting both reversible and irreversible changes with clear visual cues and labels. The reversible change with ice is shown with arrows indicating both melting and refreezing, while the irreversible change with the egg is illustrated using a crossed-out arrow. The omitted melted chocolate component and potential missing labels reflect the student's struggles as described."
