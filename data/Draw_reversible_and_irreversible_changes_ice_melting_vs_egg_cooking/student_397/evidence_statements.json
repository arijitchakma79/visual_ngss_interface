  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the starting state of a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice as a solid, a raw egg).",
    "The student can show the changed state of a material after it has been heated (e.g., melted ice as water, a cooked egg).",
    "The student can depict if the change is reversible by showing the material returning to its original state (e.g., water becoming ice again).",
    "The student can demonstrate an irreversible change by showing a material that does not return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become a raw egg again).",
    "The student can draw a sequence of cause and effect to illustrate how heating or cooling causes these changes.",
    "The student can use labels or captions to explain their drawings and reasoning about why some changes can be reversed and others cannot."
