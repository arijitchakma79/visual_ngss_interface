  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the starting state of a material before it is heated or cooled, such as drawing ice as a solid and a raw egg.",
    "The student can show the changed state of a material after it has been heated, such as drawing melted ice as water and a cooked egg.",
    "The student can depict if the change is reversible by showing water becoming ice again, completing the cycle.",
    "The student can demonstrate an irreversible change by accurately drawing a cooked egg and indicating it cannot return to a raw state.",
    "The student can draw a detailed sequence of cause and effect, using arrows or timelines to show how heating or cooling causes these changes to occur.",
    "The student can use clear labels or captions to explain their drawings and reasoning about why some changes can be reversed and others cannot, demonstrating a strong understanding."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently or unclearly label one or two components due to minor lapses in attention (e.g., forgetting to label one drawing out of several).",
    "Although capable of advanced work, the student might occasionally omit a detail, such as a minor step in the cause-effect sequence, due to oversight."
