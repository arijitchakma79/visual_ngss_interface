  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., ice as a solid block, a raw egg in its shell).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, illustrating the change (e.g., ice becomes liquid water, a raw egg becomes a cooked egg).",
    "The student can highlight the reversible changes by showing how some materials can return to their original state (e.g., liquid water can be cooled to become ice again).",
    "The student can illustrate irreversible changes by showing materials that do not return to their original state after cooling or heating (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can include labels or short descriptions in the drawing to explain the changes observed and whether they are reversible or irreversible."
