  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a big, blocky shape to represent ice. Since ice is solid, I'll make sure it’s a rectangle and write 'Ice' on it. Next to the ice, I’ll draw a simple oval shape with lines for the raw egg and label it 'Raw Egg.' I remember that ice turns to water when it melts, so I'll add some wavy lines next to the rectangle to show liquid water and label it 'Water.' But, I'm not sure how to show that water turns back into ice, so I'll skip adding arrows or anything else that indicates a reversal. For the egg, I know it changes when it cooks, but I’m not sure how to draw the change well. I’ll draw another simple oval, maybe with some lines to suggest a crack, but it kinda looks like the raw egg still. I’ll label it 'Cooked Egg.' I remember both ice melting and eggs cooking are changes, but I'm not sure how to show that cooked egg is different than raw egg or that it can't change back.",
  "Prompt": "Drawings of two sets of objects on a white background. On the left, a rectangular blue block labeled 'Ice' with wavy blue lines next to it labeled 'Water.' On the right, a simple oval labeled 'Raw Egg' and another similar oval with a few added thin lines, labeled 'Cooked Egg.' The style is simple and colorful with labels in clear block letters.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's emerging understanding and the ability to illustrate the basic state changes like ice to water but not back again, as described in the 'CAN' section. The student accurately draws and labels the initial states and some changes but lacks clarity in demonstrating reversibility (ice) and distinction in irreversible change (egg)."
