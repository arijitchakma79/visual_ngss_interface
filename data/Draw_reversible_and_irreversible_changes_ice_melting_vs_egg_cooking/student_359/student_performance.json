  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of the materials, like ice or an egg, before they undergo heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show the change in state after heating for both examples, such as ice melting into water and an egg being cooked.",
    "The student can illustrate reversible changes like water freezing back into ice by cooling, though this may not be perfectly clear or fully labeled.",
    "The student can depict irreversible changes, such as a cooked egg not returning to its original state, with some understanding of the concept.",
    "The student can generally show cause and effect in their drawings, such as including arrows or labels to indicate heating or cooling, although minor details might be missing or inconsistently applied."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently or fully explain the reasoning behind why some changes are irreversible, potentially missing labels or steps.",
    "The student could mix up the depiction of reversible and irreversible changes by occasionally omitting important elements, like forgetting to indicate cooling in the irreversible example with cooked eggs.",
    "There might be minor gaps in illustrating the process of change, such as missing arrows or unclear transitions between states, indicating a less detailed understanding of the entire process."
