  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (like ice or an egg) before any heating or cooling happens.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating it, showing whether it changes to a different state (e.g., ice melting to water, an egg being cooked).",
    "The student can illustrate if the changes can be reversed by cooling (like water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate if the changes cannot be reversed by cooling (like cooked eggs they remain solid).",
    "The student can show a clear cause and effect in their drawing, indicating the steps of heating and cooling and the outcomes (reversible or irreversible)."
