  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the initial state of both materials. For the ice, I’ll draw a clear blue cube, maybe with some white shading to show it's frosty. Next, for the egg, I’ll draw a whole egg, kind of an oval and white, maybe with a little speckled texture. Now to show the changes. The ice should melt, so I’ll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle of water. The water will be light blue. For the egg, I'll draw an arrow to show it's on a pan over a stove, but I might struggle to show it cooking the right way. I know the egg won’t change back like the ice, but maybe I’ll forget to draw a clear arrow indicating that. I’ll attempt to show that the water can refreeze by adding an arrow back to a blue cube, but it might be a bit messy. I’ll draw extra arrows and labels for heating and cooling, but I might miss some minor details.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil sketch illustration showing two sequences. On the left, a sequence of ice turning into water and back to ice, with simple blue shading for the ice cube and light blue for water. An arrow labeled 'heat' points from the ice to water; another arrow labeled 'cool' points back from the water to the ice. The right sequence shows an egg turning into a cooked egg. An egg drawn in simple white is shown on the first stage, with an arrow labeled 'heat' leading to a picture of the cooked egg in a frying pan on a stove. The cooked egg is yellow and white, with slight shading. Arrows and labels illustrating the process are included, some labeled and some not. The overall style is that of a neat but simple school science drawing, with small gaps, such as missing labels or uneven application of shading and transitions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's level of proficiency by including clear initial states and processes for changes. The ice turns to water and back, demonstrating their understanding of reversible changes, while the egg shows irreversible changes. Gaps like missing labels or incomplete transitions indicate their struggles with precise details and consistent logic application, matching the described capabilities and limitations."
