  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw something that looks like a block of ice and a sunny day, possibly showing ice turning into water with no clear indication of it freezing again or any mention of reversibility.",
    "The student might draw an egg, but with no clear distinction between its raw and cooked states, possibly just drawing an egg in a pan."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show ice refreezing back into its original form, missing the concept of it being a reversible change (student does not understand refreezing process).",
    "The student may not represent the cooked egg accurately or fails to indicate that it cannot return to its raw state (misunderstanding irreversibility).",
    "The student probably wonâ€™t depict or label causes and effects such as heating or cooling and their impact on materials (does not connect heat as a cause leading to change in state).",
    "The student is not likely to compare the two scenarios for reversible and irreversible changes, lacking understanding of different outcomes."
