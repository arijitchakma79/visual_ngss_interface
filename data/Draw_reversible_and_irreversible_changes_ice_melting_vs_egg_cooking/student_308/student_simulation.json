  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll try to draw something that looks like a block of ice. I think ice has a kind of cube shape, so I'll draw a square or rectangle and maybe make it look a bit shiny. I remember ice melts into water, so I'll add some water drops or a little puddle below it to show it’s melting. But I’m not sure how to show it freezing again; maybe I'll just focus on the melting part. Now for the egg, I’ll draw an egg in a frying pan. I know eggs are oval, but I’m not exactly sure how to show it changing. Maybe I can just make some lines to show it’s cooking or sizzling. I’m not sure how to show that it can't go back to being raw again, so I'll just leave it as is. There are no labels or reasons depicted in my drawings, because I'm not clear on how heating or cooling actually changes these things.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two situations: on the left, a block of ice in a sunny setting with water droplets forming below it, all in pastel blue and white colors. On the right, draw an egg in a black frying pan on a stove, with some squiggly lines above to show it's cooking. The ice and egg look very simple, with no detailed labels or explanations. The style should be very basic, almost like crayon or marker drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's level and misunderstandings. The student can depict ice melting with some effort but can't show it refreezing, missing the reversible aspect. For the egg, the student can show it being cooked but doesn't show or understand it's an irreversible change. Lack of labels or causes aligns with not connecting heat with changes in state."
