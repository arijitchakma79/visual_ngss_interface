  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice, showing it as a reversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate a raw egg turning into a cooked egg and explain that it cannot turn back into a raw egg, showing it as an irreversible change.",
    "The student can represent the characteristics of materials before, during, and after heating or cooling (e.g., showing the stages of ice melting and refreezing, and the egg before and after cooking).",
    "The student can identify and label causes and effects in their drawings, such as how heating or cooling leads to changes in the state of the material.",
    "The student can compare the two scenarios in their illustration, pointing out the different outcomes: reversibility in one and irreversibility in the other."
