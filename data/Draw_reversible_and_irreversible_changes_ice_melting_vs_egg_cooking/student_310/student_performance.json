  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a basic shape resembling ice, but without clear differentiation from other objects, possibly a rough square or rectangle.",
    "Include an object that could be interpreted as an egg before heating, though it may lack clear details."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Illustrate the material transformation from ice to water accurately (student may not show the melting process or aftermath correctly).",
    "Depict how water freezes back into ice (student may not understand the reversible nature or omit this entirely).",
    "Draw a cooked egg with proper changes (student may represent it similarly before and after heating).",
    "Use arrows or labels to show cause and effect of heating and cooling (student might exclude these or use them inconsistently).",
    "Argue or explain why some changes can be reversed while others cannot through their drawings (student lacks understanding of the concepts)."
