  "Reasoning": "I need to draw something about ice melting and egg cooking. Let me start with drawing ice. Ice is a bit hard to draw, but I'll try. I think a block shape can be ice, like a square or a rectangle. I'll just draw a block and leave it at that. Now, an egg before it's cooked. Eggs are oval, I think, so I'll draw an oval shape. I don't remember much about how these change exactly, so I'll just leave them as is. I remember ice melts to water, but I'm not sure how to draw that exactly or how water turns back to ice. For the egg, I know it changes when cooked, but my drawing just shows the oval again since I'm not sure what else to do. I'm supposed to show something about heating and cooling, but I don't know how exactly, so I'll skip that part.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing made by a young student showing two separate parts: one part with a blocky shape that looks like a rough square or rectangle, representing ice, and another part with an oval shape, symbolizing an egg before cooking. The drawing should have a child-like pencil sketch style with minimal details and no additional elements such as arrows or labels. Use simple colors like light blue for the ice shape and white for the egg shape.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by capturing their capability to draw basic shapes representing ice and an egg, but not accurately showing transformations like melting or cooking. The absence of arrows or labels and the lack of detail in illustrating changes reflect the student's struggles to illustrate reversible and irreversible processes, which aligns with the student's limitations as described."
