  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of a material before heating, such as the shape of ice or an unbroken egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of a material after heating, showing water from melted ice or a cooked egg.",
    "The student can depict the characteristics of a material when heating is reversed, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can demonstrate, through drawing, if a change is reversible, like water freezing after melting, using arrows or labels.",
    "The student can illustrate if a change is irreversible, like a cooked egg remaining solid, with clear examples and labels.",
    "The student can include arrows or labels to show the cause and effect of heating and cooling, highlighting observable patterns.",
    "The student can use elements in the drawing to argue why some changes can be reversed while others cannot, based on their understanding."
