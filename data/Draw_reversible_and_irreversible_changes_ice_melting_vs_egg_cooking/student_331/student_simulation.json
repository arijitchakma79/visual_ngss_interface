  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a chunk of ice. I know that ice can melt into a puddle of water, so I'll draw a little pool next to it. I remember that ice melting is reversible because you can refreeze it, but I'm not sure how to show that clearly with arrows. Now, I'll try to label it as reversible, but I'm not exactly sure how 'reversible' is spelled. Now, for the egg. I'll draw a raw egg, still in the shell. Next, I'll try to show a cooked egg. I'm not sure of all the changes that happen inside, so I'll just draw an egg with some wavy lines over it to show it's been heated. I should label this as irreversible, but that word is hard to write and I don't fully understand why it's different from ice. I think both changes use heat, so my drawings might look similar.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing on a plain white background. On one side, there is a blue, jagged piece of ice with a small puddle of water next to it, labeled 'revesible'. On the other side, there is a brown egg in its shell, next to an egg with yellow and white, showing wavy heat lines above it, labeled 'irreversible' with a possible misspelling. Use crayons or markers style with bright colors and a somewhat rough, uneven finish.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's emerging understanding. It includes the ice melting, which the student can draw with basic elements, but lacks detailed arrows. The label recognizes reversibility but might be misspelled, reflecting the student's level. For the egg, there's an attempt to show change with heat lines, but it lacks full comprehension, with labeling errors anticipated."
