{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "The student at Level 4 demonstrates an advanced, complete, and accurate representation of all the elements required by the task.",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the characteristics of ice before and after it melts, and illustrate how it can refreeze into ice with clear visual cues showing the process.",
    "The student can draw the change in an egg from raw to cooked, clearly showing the irreversible nature of this change.",
    "The student can illustrate a material like chocolate, showing it melting with heat and solidifying again, explaining the reversible nature in detail.",
    "The student can contrast reversible changes, like water freezing and melting, with irreversible changes, like a cooked egg, effectively using arrows and labels.",
    "The student includes drawings that clearly explain cause and effect, accurately showing how heating and cooling cause changes, and differentiating whether these changes are reversible or irreversible."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit labels or fail to fully label every element in drawings, but this is minimal and does not detract significantly from understanding.",
    "The student might show slightly less precision in one illustration, such as not fully detailing the texture differences between raw and cooked egg, but still conveys the concept clearly."
