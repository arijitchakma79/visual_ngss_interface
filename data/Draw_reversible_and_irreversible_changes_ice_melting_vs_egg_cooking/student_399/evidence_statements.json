  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture showing the characteristics of ice before and after it melts, and how it can freeze back into ice.",
    "The student can draw a picture showing how heating an egg causes it to cook and change, and how it cannot go back to being raw.",
    "The student can illustrate an example of a material that changes with heating, like chocolate melting and then solidifying differently.",
    "The student can show a clear difference between reversible changes (like water freezing and melting) and irreversible changes (like a cooked egg).",
    "The student can include drawings that explain cause and effect, showing how heating and cooling cause changes, and identify if these changes are reversible or irreversible."
