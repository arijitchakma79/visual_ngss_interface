  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two separate panels on my paper to show the different types of changes. First, I'll focus on ice melting, which is a reversible change. I'll draw an ice cube on one side, looking clear and cold. Then, I'll draw the same shape but with puddles of water around it to show it has melted. I'll include an arrow between the ice and the water to indicate the melting process. Next, I'll show the water turning back into ice, using another arrow pointed upwards. I'll try to use blue and white to clearly show this happens with cooling. Now, I'll move to the second panel for the irreversible change. I'll draw a raw egg first, with a thin, clear shell. Next, I'll show the egg after it's been cooked, with visible texture changes - maybe I'll draw it scrambled to really show the difference. I'll label 'raw egg' and 'cooked egg' but sometimes I forget to label every part in detail, but I'll remember the main ones. I'll use arrows and a red color shift to indicate it can't be reversed. I've read that chocolate melting is reversible, so if I have space, I'll draw a small piece melting and solidifying again. I'll add labels and use colors like brown for chocolate to contrast with the blue ice and white egg. I have to make sure to clearly show which changes can be reversed with arrows labeled 'reversible' or 'irreversible'. Sometimes, I miss details in these textures, but I'll do my best to make the differences clear.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing with two main panels. The first panel shows an ice cube melting into water - the ice is colored in shades of light blue and white, with arrows indicating reversible change. The melted water refreezes back into ice, shown clearly with labeled arrows. The second panel illustrates a raw egg transforming into a scrambled egg, highlighting texture changes with visible details and a cooking pan. The raw egg is a pale yellow-white color, while the cooked egg shows more yellow and white mixed. Use red arrows labeled 'irreversible'. Additionally, include a small illustration of a piece of chocolate in the lower corner, showing it melting and resolidifying with brown. Ensure labels are clear but acknowledge possible missing minor details in textures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by depicting clear, labeled reversible and irreversible changes using appropriate colors and arrows to clarify direction and type of change. The student demonstrates understanding of the processes involved and labels major elements, fulfilling the task's main requirements. However, occasional omissions in labels or detailed textures are acknowledged, aligning with the described limitations of the student's performance."
