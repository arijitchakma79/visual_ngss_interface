  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material when heated or cooled (e.g., ice turning into water, an egg being cooked).",
    "The student can show whether the change is reversible by illustrating what happens if the heating or cooling is reversed (e.g., water freezing back into ice, a cooked egg staying solid).",
    "The student can use labeling or arrows in their drawing to indicate cause and effect (e.g., heat applied to ice makes it melt).",
    "The student can write a simple caption explaining if and how the change can be reversed (e.g., 'ice can freeze again,' 'cooked egg cannot turn back into raw egg').",
    "The student can illustrate or describe observable patterns of reversible changes (e.g., showing the cycle of ice melting and refreezing).",
    "The student can illustrate or describe observable patterns of irreversible changes (e.g., showing that a cooked egg remains solid)."
