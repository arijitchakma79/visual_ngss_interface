  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw basic shapes resembling the starting state of materials like ice and raw eggs, but may not label them correctly or at all.",
    "Attempt to show something happening to the materials when heated, but details might be incorrect (e.g., scribbles over the ice cube or egg)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Illustrate clear changes that occur when heating or cooling (e.g., might not depict water from ice or solid cooked egg from raw egg).",
    "Show whether changes are reversible or irreversible (e.g., might not show melted ice refreezing, or cooked egg staying solid).",
    "Use labeling or arrows accurately to indicate cause and effect (e.g., missing arrows, arrows pointing in no consistent direction).",
    "Write a correct caption explaining if and how the change can be reversed (e.g., 'ice cannot freeze again', 'cooked egg becomes raw again').",
    "Illustrate observable patterns of reversible changes (e.g., may attempt a cycle but lacks continuity or correct sequence).",
    "Illustrate observable patterns of irreversible changes (e.g., might draw the egg scrambled without showing it solidified or cooked)."
