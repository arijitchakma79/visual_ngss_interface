  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw an ice cube and a raw egg but may not label them correctly (basic shapes but lacks detail).",
    "Attempt to draw a melted state of ice and a cooked egg with little detail or accuracy (primitive representation)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Fail to accurately label the starting or changed state of materials (may confuse ice for water or raw egg for cooked, or forget to label altogether).",
    "Misunderstand or omit the concept of reversibility (may show both changes as irreversible or reversible incorrectly).",
    "Not use or incorrectly place arrows to show the direction of change (may draw arrows randomly or not related to heating/cooling).",
    "Neglect to represent cause-effect relationships (heating or cooling) or misidentify them (may not connect ice melting to warming or egg cooking to heat exposure).",
    "Exclude labels or symbols crucial for indicating processes and effects (may draw but lack any explanatory labels or details)."
