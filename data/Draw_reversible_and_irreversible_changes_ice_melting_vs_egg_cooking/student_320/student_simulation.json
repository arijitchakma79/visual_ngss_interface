  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw reversible and irreversible changes. First, I’ll draw an ice cube. I know ice is usually just a square, so I'll draw a square. Ice is cold, maybe I'll color it light blue to show it’s cold. Next, I’ll draw a raw egg. Eggs are oval... I think I’ll draw an oval shape. I might color it light brown. Now, I need to show the changes. For the ice, it changes to water. I’ll draw the ice cube melting, maybe just add some squiggly lines. For the cooked egg, I need to show it as cooked. I'll draw the same egg but maybe add some random wavy lines... I think cooking uses heat... okay, done! Oh, I forgot, I should add labels. Umm... Which is which again? I'll try to write ‘ice’ and ‘egg’ but I might mix them up or forget. Arrows! Yes, arrows to show... what was it again? I think it shows direction? I'll draw arrows but they're confusing... I’m not sure if I'd do them right. Maybe put one somewhere between 'ice' and 'water'? Or maybe not. Forget it. Did I need to say whether it’s reversible? I remember something about ice can go back, but maybe both can! I’ll just leave that. I’m done.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing on a plain white background. On the left, a light blue square labeled 'ice', slightly melting with some squiggly lines to represent water, with an arrow above pointing downwards but not clearly relating to heat or cooling. On the right, an oval shape representing a raw egg, colored light brown, with wavy lines near it as an attempt to show cooking, with a wrongly placed arrow nearby. Labels are present but confusing, such as incorrectly identifying ice as water or the egg as cooked. The drawing style is primitive, with crude shapes and basic colors. Little to no detail is visible, and there's confusion in labeling and symbol placement.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes and use simple colors but lacks accuracy and detail, which corresponds to the student's level description. Labels and arrows are included but may be misplaced or not clearly connected to the changes, showing the student's struggle with accuracy in representing processes and effects. The overall effort aligns with the student's minimal understanding described in the task."
