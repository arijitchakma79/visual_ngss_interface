  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the starting state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw and label the change in the material after heating or cooling (e.g., ice melting into water, a raw egg becoming a cooked egg).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change in the material is reversible by showing the process of cooling or reheating (e.g., water freezing back to ice, inability to transform a cooked egg to raw).",
    "The student can use arrows and labels to indicate which changes are reversible and which are not.",
    "The student can represent the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect (change in the material) in their drawing, using labels or symbols."
