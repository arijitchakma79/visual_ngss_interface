  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a big piece of ice on the left side of my page. I remember that ice is a solid, so I’ll make it look hard and blue. Next, I’ll draw an arrow pointing to the right, and then a puddle of water. I’ll write 'melting' above the arrow to show the change. Then, I’ll draw another arrow going back from the water to the ice and write 'freezing', because water can turn back into ice. On the right side of my page, I’ll draw a raw egg with a yellow yolk visible. I’ll put it next to a frying pan and draw a cooked egg in the pan. To show that this change is different, I'll draw an 'X' over a backward arrow, emphasizing that the cooked egg can’t go back to being raw, and write 'irreversible'. I need to make sure my drawing shows the solid and liquid states clearly and label the processes properly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a two-part illustration showing reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, depict a blue, solid cube of ice turning into a small puddle with the word 'melting' above a right-directed arrow. Include another arrow pointing back to the ice with the word 'freezing'. On the right, illustrate a raw egg with a prominent yellow yolk near a frying pan with a solid, cooked egg inside. Place an 'X' over a backward arrow to emphasize irreversibility. Use simple, cartoonish style with clear, labeled transitions, and vibrant, distinguishable colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency by including labeled state changes with arrows, demonstrating the reversibility of melting and freezing. It reflects the student's ability to differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes using clear visuals and labels. The inclusion of an 'X' over the backward arrow for the egg emphasizes the irreversible change, showing understanding of the task requirements."
