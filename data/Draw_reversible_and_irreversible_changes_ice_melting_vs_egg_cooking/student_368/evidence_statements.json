  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can clearly illustrate a change that is caused by heating, such as ice melting into water, and show that this change is reversible.",
    "The student can clearly illustrate a change that is caused by cooling, such as water freezing into ice, and show that this change is reversible.",
    "The student can illustrate a change that is caused by heating, such as a raw egg cooking into a solid egg, and show that this change is irreversible.",
    "The student can include before and after characteristics of materials, showing what happens to them when they are heated or cooled.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of reversible changes by showing how water can repeatedly freeze or melt.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of irreversible changes by showing that a cooked egg cannot turn back into a raw egg."
