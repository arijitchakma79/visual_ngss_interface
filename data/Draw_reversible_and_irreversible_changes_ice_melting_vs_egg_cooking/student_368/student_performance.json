  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate ice melting into water and show that this change is reversible (may include arrows or labels indicating melting and refreezing).",
    "Illustrate water freezing back into ice and identify it as a reversible change.",
    "Illustrate a raw egg cooking into a solid egg and label it as an irreversible change (student may clearly show the cooked egg alongside the raw egg to emphasize the change).",
    "Include both before and after characteristics of materials, such as the solid nature of the ice and the liquid state of water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Fail to indicate clearly that a cooked egg cannot be reverted to a raw egg (may omit explicit labeling of irreversibility).",
    "Occasionally omit or incorrectly label state changes (such as forgetting to clearly label 'melting' or 'freezing')."
