  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice before it is heated and show the transition to water as it melts.",
    "The student can draw a raw egg before cooking and demonstrate it transforming into a solid cooked egg.",
    "The student can depict the concept of reversible change by showing melted water turning back into ice upon cooling.",
    "The student may accurately illustrate the cause and effect between applying heat to ice and the resulting melting process.",
    "The student can generally show that heating and cooling affect materials in different ways, like melting vs. solidifying."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently show that a cooked egg change is irreversible (e.g., might imply it can return to raw state).",
    "The student could sometimes omit or mislabel the transition back to a solid state in ice when it is cooled again (e.g., forget to draw freezing process).",
    "The student may neglect to clarify why the egg can't go back to its raw state, possibly due to a lack of understanding of irreversible changes (e.g., fails to clearly label irreversible vs. reversible)."
