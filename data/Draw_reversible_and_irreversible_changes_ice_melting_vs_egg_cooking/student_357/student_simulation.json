  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a piece of ice in a light blue color. I know that when ice is heated, it becomes water, so I'll show the ice melting into a small puddle. I'll use arrows to show that the ice turns into water when it heats up, and if I cool it, it turns back into ice, showing a reversible process. Next, I'll draw a raw egg in a light yellow color. I need to show how heating affects it by drawing another egg that's cooked and looks more solidified. This transformation shows an irreversible change since the egg can't become raw again. I need to make sure my drawings clearly show that the melted ice can become ice againâ€”a reversible change, but sometimes I get confused about labeling the egg change correctly. I should try to include labels to make it clearer but might forget to properly indicate why the egg process is irreversible.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing two parts: on the left, depict a block of light blue ice melting into a puddle of water with arrows indicating the melting and refreezing process. Use blue and white colors to illustrate the reversible change. On the right, illustrate a light yellow raw egg transforming into a solid brownish cooked egg, with no arrows going backward, to suggest an irreversible change. Include simple labels: 'Reversible' above the ice diagram and 'Irreversible' above the egg diagram. Use a basic, child-like drawing style, with bright, clear colors and simple outlines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's understanding of reversible and irreversible changes. The use of arrows for the ice melting and refreezing shows the reversible nature, which the student can do. However, the lack of backward arrows for the egg change aligns with the student's struggle to consistently indicate that this is an irreversible process. Simple labels attempt to clarify these concepts in line with the student's tendency to sometimes neglect clear labeling."
