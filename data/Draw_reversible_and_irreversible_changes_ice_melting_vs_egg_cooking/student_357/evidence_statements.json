  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw the change in the material after it is heated (e.g., ice melting into water, raw egg cooking into a solid).",
    "The student can draw whether the change is reversible by showing if the material can return to its original state (e.g., water freezing back into ice, a cooked egg staying solid).",
    "The student can draw the change in the material after it is cooled (e.g., melted water becoming ice again).",
    "The student can show through drawings that some changes are irreversible by depicting changes that cannot be reversed (e.g., a cooked egg not changing back into a raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the concept of cause and effect by showing how heating or cooling causes the material to change in a specific way.",
    "The student can illustrate how heating and cooling affect different materials differently based on observable patterns."
