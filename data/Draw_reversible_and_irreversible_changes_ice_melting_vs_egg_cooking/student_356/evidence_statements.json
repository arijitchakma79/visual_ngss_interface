  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate and label a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., solid ice cube, uncooked egg).",
    "The student can illustrate and label the material after heating (e.g., water from melted ice, cooked egg).",
    "The student can illustrate and label whether the change after heating is reversible or irreversible (e.g., water can refreeze into ice, cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can illustrate and label a material after cooling (e.g., ice from water).",
    "The student can illustrate and describe whether the change after cooling is reversible or irreversible (e.g., ice can melt back into water).",
    "The student can show a cause-effect relationship by drawing a sequence that illustrates how heating or cooling leads to observable changes.",
    "The student can provide evidence in their drawing to support a claim about which changes are reversible and which are not (e.g., drawing arrows showing water freezing and melting, and cooked egg not reversing to raw)."
