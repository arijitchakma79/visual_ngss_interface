  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw an ice cube. I remember that it starts as a solid, so I’ll label it 'Solid Ice Cube'. Now, I'll draw an uncooked egg. I shouldn’t forget to label it 'Uncooked Egg'. Next, I’ll show what happens when you heat them. I'll draw a puddle of water next to the ice and label it 'Liquid Water'. For the egg, I’ll draw it fried and label it 'Cooked Egg'. To show reversible change, I'll put an arrow going from the water back to a new ice cube, labeled 'Refrozen Ice'. I should write 'Reversible' next to it because the ice can become water and then ice again. For the egg, since I know it can't go back to being uncooked, I'll write 'Irreversible'. I might forget to label 'liquid' for the water puddle, but I think it's okay. I'll draw arrows to show how heating and cooling changes things, but I have to be careful not to mix them up. I'll use colors like blue for ice, yellow for the ice melting arrow, white and yellow for the uncooked and cooked eggs, and gray for the cooked egg arrow.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing with two panels. The left panel shows a blue solid ice cube labeled 'Solid Ice Cube' at the top, with an arrow pointing down to a puddle of water labeled 'Water'. Another arrow points back up to another blue ice cube titled 'Refrozen Ice'. Write 'Reversible' near this sequence. The right panel shows a white uncooked egg labeled 'Uncooked Egg' at the top, with an arrow pointing down to a gray and yellow fried egg labeled 'Cooked Egg'. Write 'Irreversible' near this sequence. Use bright colors in a child-like crayon style, with simple labels and arrows. Make sure arrows are clear and easy to follow.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by showing the correct sequence of changes with clear labels on most elements and depicting the reversibility of ice. It correctly identifies reversible and irreversible changes. However, it aligns with the student's struggles by potentially missing the label for 'liquid' under the water and limits the explanation of why a cooked egg is irreversible. The simple color scheme and child-like style represent the level of proficiency and effort described by the student's capabilities."
