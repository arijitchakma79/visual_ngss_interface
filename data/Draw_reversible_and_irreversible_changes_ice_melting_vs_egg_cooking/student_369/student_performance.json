  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the original state of materials (e.g., an ice cube and a raw egg).",
    "The student can depict changes clearly, such as showing ice turning into water and a raw egg turning solid after cooking.",
    "The student can indicate reversible changes by showing water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can attempt to show the irreversible nature of a cooked egg, indicating it can't revert to a raw state.",
    "The student can connect heating and cooling processes to the changes observed with arrows or annotations (e.g., heat applied to the egg)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may partially show or inconsistently depict the reversibility process (e.g., they may show ice melting and freezing but miss some details or not show the full sequence back to the original state).",
    "The student might show minor gaps in consistently connecting cause and effect (e.g., arrows or labels might be missing in one of the steps illustrating change).",
    "The student may overlook complete details in depicting irreversible changes (e.g., may not clearly indicate why the cooked egg cannot return to a raw state)."
