  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating or cooling, showing its original state.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating or cooling and highlight the changes observed.",
    "The student can depict whether the change in the material is reversible by illustrating the process of reversing or not reversing the change (e.g., water freezing back to ice or a cooked egg staying cooked).",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of reversible changes with a drawing, such as showing ice melting into water and freezing back to ice.",
    "The student can depict irreversible changes in a drawing, like a raw egg becoming solid after cooking and not returning to its original form.",
    "The student can connect the cause (heating or cooling) to the effect (material change) through their illustrations.",
    "The student can use drawings to support an argument about whether a given change (from heating or cooling) is reversible or irreversible, based on the evidence shown."
