  "Reasoning": "I need to draw ice melting and an egg cooking, showing which changes are reversible and irreversible. I'll start by drawing an ice cube. I know ice melting is reversible, so I'll draw an arrow turning into a puddle and then another arrow back into an ice cube. I'll label one with 'melting' and the other with 'freezing.' For the egg, I'll draw a raw egg and then an arrow to a cooked egg. I'll label this arrow with 'heated' because cooking makes it solid, but I know it can't go back to raw. I think I should show heat for the cooking process through waves or something. Sometimes I get mixed up remembering to show all the steps for the ice, like freezing back completely to show it's reversible. I might forget some arrows or why the cooked egg can't return to raw form.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing on plain paper showing a simple illustration of reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, a blue ice cube with an arrow labeled 'melting' pointing to a blue water puddle. Another arrow labeled 'freezing' points back to another blue ice cube. On the right, a white raw egg with an arrow labeled 'heated' leading to a golden-yellow cooked egg on a plate. The cooked egg has wavy lines coming from it, indicating heat. The style is child-like with hand-drawn quality, using bold, simplistic shapes and basic colors, with annotations next to arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by clearly exhibiting the initial states and changes, showing reversible changes with ice, and indicating heating for the egg. It highlights what they struggle with by mentioning potential missing annotations or complete reversibility detail, reflecting minor struggles with full cause-and-effect consistency."
