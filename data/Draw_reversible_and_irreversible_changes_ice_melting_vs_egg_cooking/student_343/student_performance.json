  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can show the initial state of the ice as solid and the egg as raw.",
    "The student can illustrate the ice turning into water after heating.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might struggle to show the egg transformation accurately or consistently indicate it is cooked. (e.g., may not change appearance correctly)",
    "The student may not effectively depict reversibility using arrows or symbols; might forget to use them or use them incorrectly. (e.g., using reversible arrows for the egg)",
    "The student might not clearly label the cause of change or label them incorrectly, such as confusing heating with cooling or not connecting them to the changes shown."
