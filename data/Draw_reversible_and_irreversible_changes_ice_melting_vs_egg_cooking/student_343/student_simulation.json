  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the ice as a solid block. I remember that ice is cold, so I'll make it blue. Next, I'll show it starting to melt by drawing water below it, maybe in a puddle. I think I need to show heating, so I'll draw some squiggly lines as heat coming from below. Then, I'll move on to the egg. I'll draw the egg as a raw egg, with a shell and maybe some cracked lines to show it’s raw. Ugh, I’m not sure about how to show the cooked egg. Maybe I'll just draw a frying pan next to the egg to show it will be heated… I'm not sure if that’s enough. Okay, now for the arrows. Let's see... I think I'll use an arrow to show ice turns into water. I’ll try to show another arrow from ice to water and maybe add some swirly arrows around the egg, but I might mess up where to put them correctly. Making sure to show ‘heating’ is important; I’ll add labels to the ice with a label ‘heating’ next to my heat lines, but making sure everything’s correctly labeled is hard. For the egg, I might forget to add the label for heating, or if I do, I might place it in the wrong spot.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two separate illustrations: on the left, a blue block of ice changing to a puddle representing melting, with squiggly lines above to represent heat and a short arrow between the ice and the water. On the right, a simple drawing of a raw egg next to a frying pan, with an unsuccessful attempt to show it becoming a cooked egg, maybe a few wavy arrows around it. Some labels are present but inconsistently placed or incomplete, reading 'heating' with no clear connection to specific parts of the drawing. The drawing is done in a crayon-style with basic, colorful elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by depicting the ice starting as solid and melting with some basic indicators of heat, which aligns with the student's emerging understanding. It reflects what the student might struggle with, such as not correctly showing the egg cooking process or using arrows inappropriately for reversibility. Inconsistent and incomplete labeling of heat further represents their difficulties in clearly labeling causes of change."
