  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can show the material before heating or cooling by drawing its initial state (e.g., ice as solid, egg as raw).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating to show the change (e.g., ice as water, egg as cooked).",
    "The student can depict whether the changes can be reversed by showing the process reversed (e.g., water turning back into ice, a cooked egg not being able to return to its raw state).",
    "The student can identify if the change is reversible or irreversible using arrows or symbols (e.g., double-headed arrow for reversible changes, crossed-out arrow for irreversible changes).",
    "The student can label the drawings to clarify the cause of the changes (heating or cooling) and their reversibility status."
