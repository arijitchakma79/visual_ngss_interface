  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw the material before, during, and after the change, including ice as a solid, water as a liquid, and back to ice as a solid again.",
    "Illustrate a reversible change completely, such as ice melting to water and refreezing into ice, showing all stages accurately with correct transitions.",
    "Illustrate an irreversible change entirely, such as depicting a raw egg, an egg being cooked, and a cooked egg, noting that it cannot return to the raw state.",
    "Use detailed drawings to show that heating sometimes causes changes that canâ€™t be undone, like a melted chocolate that remains in a new shape.",
    "Accurately label all parts of their drawings with observations before and after heating/cooling, noting changes in state and characteristics of the materials.",
    "Clearly show and label the effects of both heating and cooling on materials, such as liquid chocolate becoming solid when cooled and a cooked egg remaining solid when cooled."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "May inconsistently include minor details like specific timeframes for each change stage *(may forget to include this detail)*.",
    "Occasionally omits or partially mislabels minor parts that do not significantly impact the understanding *(labels might be incomplete for lesser important elements)*."
