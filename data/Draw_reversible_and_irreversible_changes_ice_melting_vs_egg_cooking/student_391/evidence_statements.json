  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before, during, and after a change caused by heating or cooling (e.g., ice before melting, ice turning to water, and water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can illustrate a reversible change, such as ice melting and refreezing into ice, showing that it can go back to its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate an irreversible change, such as a raw egg being cooked and not turning back to its raw form, showing that it cannot go back to its original state.",
    "The student can use drawings to show that sometimes heating or cooling causes changes that can't be undone (e.g., showing a melted chocolate that solidifies in a new shape but cannot return to its original shape).",
    "The student can label their drawings with observations before and after the heating or cooling to show the characteristics of materials.",
    "The student can draw and label the effects of both heating and cooling on different materials (e.g., liquid chocolate becoming solid when cooled and a cooked egg remaining solid when cooled)."
