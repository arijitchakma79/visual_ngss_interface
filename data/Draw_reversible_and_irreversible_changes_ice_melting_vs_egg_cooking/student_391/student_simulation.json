  "Reasoning": "Okay, let's start by tackling the reversible change with ice. I'll draw ice as a solid cube first. I remember that ice is clear and has a unique shape, so I'll sketch that first. Next, I'll move on to the melting part - I'll show the ice turning into water. The water should look a bit puddle-like, so I'll make it spread out. After that, I'll show the water freezing back into a solid block of ice. I'll make sure all the stages are connected, maybe with arrows, to show the transition. It's important to label these stages with terms like 'solid ice,' 'liquid water,' and 'solid ice again.' Now onto the irreversible change with the egg. I'll start with a raw egg in its shell. Then, I'll draw the egg being cracked open and cooked so it's clear it can't go back to a raw form. I'll make sure to use arrows to show each stage and label them as 'raw egg,' 'cracking,' and 'cooked egg.' I've got to remember to label all the parts with what's happening during the changes and not worry too much if I skip on tiny details like exactly how long each process takes.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed scientific drawing illustrating reversible and irreversible changes with labels. On the left, sketch a sequence of three stages: ice as a clear solid cube, a puddle of water, and a solid ice cube again, using arrows to indicate the transitions and labels like 'solid ice,' 'liquid water,' and 'solid ice again.' On the right, depict an irreversible change with a sequence: a raw egg in its shell, an egg being cracked open, and a cooked egg, using arrows to indicate the transition and labels like 'raw egg,' 'cracking,' and 'cooked egg.' Use vibrant colors and clear lines to differentiate between stages.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict both reversible and irreversible changes, showing each stage with clarity and accuracy. It includes labels for all major parts and transitions, which aligns with the student's capability to represent elements accurately, while recognizing they may omit minor time-related details. The drawing style is set to be vibrant and clear to ensure all transformations are distinguished and understandable."
