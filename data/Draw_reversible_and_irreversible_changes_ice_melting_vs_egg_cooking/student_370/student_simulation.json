  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw an ice cube in a clear, rectangular shape and label it 'ice'. Then, I’ll draw it melting into a puddle of water and label it 'water'. To show it's reversible, I'll use arrows going from 'water' back to 'ice'. Next, I'll draw a whole egg and label it 'egg'. Then, I'll sketch a cracked egg in a pan to show it's cooking, and label it 'cooked egg'. I'll put an arrow from 'egg' to 'cooked egg' to show it’s a change, but I think I should probably reverse it back to a normal egg too. Wait, no, that's right I can't, so I’ll just leave the arrows pointing one way. I write a little note underneath, explaining that ice melting is reversible because water can freeze again, but I struggle to write clearly why a cooked egg can’t turn back into a raw egg.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing in colored pencils showing two stages of ice and egg. On the left, there's a blue ice cube labeled 'ice' that transitions into a puddle of water labeled 'water' with blue arrows indicating the change is reversible. On the right, a brown and white whole egg is shown, labeled 'egg', followed by a cracked egg with a yellow yolk in a pan labeled 'cooked egg'. There are black arrows going forward to show the change. At the bottom, there's a few lines of handwritten text prompting that ice melting is reversible, with the explanation being not fully clear.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by accurately capturing their capability to draw and label materials, including the initial state with whole egg and ice cube. It reflects their skill in representing reversible changes with arrows for melting ice but highlights their misunderstanding by incorrectly hinting at reversing the cooked egg change, even if avoided. The handwritten text captures their ability to explain the reversible nature of melting but also signifies their struggle with explaining why cooking cannot be reversed."
