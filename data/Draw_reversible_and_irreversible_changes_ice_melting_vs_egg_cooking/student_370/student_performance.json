  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label the material before heating or cooling, such as a whole egg and an ice cube.",
    "The student can draw and label the material after heating, like a cooked egg and melted ice as water.",
    "The student can illustrate the reversible change by showing water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can use arrows or other visual markers to indicate reversible and irreversible changes, although slightly inconsistent in placement.",
    "The student can provide a caption or description explaining whether melting is reversible and why, with mostly clear reasoning."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to fully explain in writing or drawing why the cooked egg cannot turn back into a raw egg (may describe this as a reversible change by mistake).",
    "The student might inconsistently label phases during cooling from water to ice, occasionally omitting labels which can confuse the process.",
    "The student may mix up visual markers, such as arrows, occasionally using them incorrectly for irreversible changes."
