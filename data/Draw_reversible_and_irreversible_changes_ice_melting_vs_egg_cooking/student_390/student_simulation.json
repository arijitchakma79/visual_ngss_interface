  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big sheet of paper in front of me to organize my ideas. First, I'll draw ice in its solid form. I'll sketch a block of ice and label it 'Ice - Solid'. Next to it, I'll draw puddles of water to show it has melted, labeling it 'Water - Liquid'. I’ll add arrows from ice to water and write 'Melting'. Since this is reversible, I’ll also draw arrows going in the opposite direction with 'Freezing'. Now I’ll move on to the egg. I’ll draw an uncooked egg and label it 'Raw Egg'. Next, I'll draw a cooked egg, maybe showing some steam to indicate it's cooked, and label it 'Cooked Egg'. Underneath, I'll write 'Cooking - Irreversible' to highlight that it can't change back. I should include cues for heat; let’s draw a sun above the ice to indicate heat melting it. I should also show the stove for the egg with flames or heat waves. Ok, I have to make sure I’ve labeled everything correctly, but I often forget some details. Just realized I didn’t label 'water' on the melted ice diagram. So I'll go back and add that in. Now, I understand that melting and freezing can go back and forth, but egg cooking doesn’t. I think my diagram shows that clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of ‘Reversible and Irreversible Changes’. On the left, illustrate a block of ice with a puddle of water beside it. Label the ice as 'Ice - Solid' and the puddle as 'Water - Liquid'. Include arrows between them labeled 'Melting' and 'Freezing' to show the process is reversible. Draw a warm sun above to indicate heat. On the right, draw a raw egg beside a cooked egg on a plate, with the raw egg labeled 'Raw Egg' and the cooked one 'Cooked Egg', with steam lines rising from it. Label the process as 'Cooking - Irreversible' and include a stovetop with heat waves. Use color: blue for ice, clear/transparent for water, yellow for the sun, and natural egg colors. The drawing style should be simple and educational.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures my ability to illustrate changes with detail and labels. I included reversible changes for ice to water with arrows and labels that show the concepts I understand well. The irreversible nature of cooking an egg is depicted similarly with annotations and visual elements like heat sources, showcasing my understanding of the irreversible concept. I addressed the common issue of missing or mislabeling elements by making sure everything needed is labeled, although I acknowledged a mistake and corrected it. This approach aligns with my advanced level description by showing a thorough and mostly accurate representation of both processes."
