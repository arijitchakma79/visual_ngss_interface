  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a detailed diagram illustrating ice in its solid form and water after it has melted, clearly labeling each stage.",
    "The student can show in their drawing that the change of water freezing back into ice is possible, possibly using arrows or notes to indicate the process is reversible.",
    "The student can accurately depict water before freezing and ice after freezing, including labels to show the transition.",
    "The student can include a clear depiction of an egg before and after cooking, with annotations explaining the irreversible nature of the cooking process.",
    "The student can illustrate the cause and effect of heating and cooling, such as showing the sun or a heat source causing ice to melt.",
    "The student can effectively demonstrate understanding that changes like ice melting can be reversed, while changes like cooking an egg cannot be reversed."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit or mislabel minor components in the diagram (e.g., forgetting to label 'water' after ice melts in one instance) but generally understands the concepts."
