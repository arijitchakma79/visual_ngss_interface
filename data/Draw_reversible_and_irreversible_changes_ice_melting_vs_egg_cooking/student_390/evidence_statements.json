  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a diagram illustrating a material before and after heating (e.g., ice before melting and water after melting).",
    "The student can show in their drawing if the change made by heating or cooling can be reversed (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate a material before and after being cooled (e.g., water before freezing and ice after freezing).",
    "The student can include in the drawing if the cooled or heated material cannot go back to its original state (e.g., cooked egg).",
    "The student can draw examples showing cause and effect of heating and cooling (e.g., ice melting from heat).",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding that some changes, like melting ice, can reverse by cooling, while others, like a cooked egg, cannot change back to their original form."
