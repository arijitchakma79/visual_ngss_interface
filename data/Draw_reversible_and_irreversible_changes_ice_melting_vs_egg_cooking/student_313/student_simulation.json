  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a cube of ice. I know ice is solid and very cold, so I'll just draw a blue square to represent it. Now, I'll draw some wavy lines next to it to show water. I think maybe if I draw an arrow between them, it shows the ice turning into water. I don’t really know how to show the water turning back into ice though. For the egg, I'll draw an egg shape to show it before it's cooked. I'll add another egg shape next to it to show it after cooking, but I’m not sure how to make it look different. Maybe I'll just color it a bit yellow for the cooked part. I think I should draw another arrow between the raw and cooked eggs. Now, I'll try to write the words 'ice', 'water', 'egg', and 'cooked'. I remember the term 'reversible', so maybe I'll write that near the water and ice. Maybe I'll write 'irreversible' for the egg part, but I'm not really sure what those words mean exactly.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing a blue square labeled 'ice' and adjacent wavy blue lines labeled 'water', connected by an arrow. Separate drawing of two egg shapes, the first plain white labeled 'egg', and the second filled with yellow labeled 'cooked'. There are arrows connecting the raw egg to the cooked egg. The labels 'reversible' near the ice and water and 'irreversible' near the eggs, although placement reflects confusion. The style is simple with basic shapes and minimal detail in colored pencil.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can and cannot do based on their understanding. The student attempts to show ice and water separately with an arrow, without clear melting or freezing process. They draw eggs before and after cooking, using minimal detail to indicate change with color. Misunderstanding of reversible and irreversible changes is shown by misplaced labels, aligning with their confusion over these concepts."
