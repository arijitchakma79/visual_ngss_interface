  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw ice and water, but the drawings may not clearly show the melting process. (student draws ice and water as separate objects with no transition)",
    "The student might draw an egg before and after being cooked without clear distinction, such as color changes or shape differences."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate liquid water being changed back into ice successfully. (student does not understand freezing process or forgets it entirely)",
    "The student may not demonstrate in their drawing that a cooked egg cannot be returned to its raw state. (student may show an arrow indicating reversibility or ignore showing this entirely)",
    "The student's drawings may not effectively show examples of reversible changes versus irreversible changes, often not labeling or mislabeling processes. (e.g., labeling egg cooking as reversible)",
    "The student may fail to use or incorrectly use labels to identify changes due to heating and cooling, often omitting important labels or misunderstanding terms like 'reversible' and 'irreversible'."
