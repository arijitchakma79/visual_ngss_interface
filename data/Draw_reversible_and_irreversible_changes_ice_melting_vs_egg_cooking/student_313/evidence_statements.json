  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of ice before it melts and as liquid water after it melts.",
    "The student can illustrate how liquid water can be changed back into ice by freezing.",
    "The student can draw a raw egg before it is cooked and show how the egg looks after it is cooked.",
    "The student can demonstrate in their drawing that a cooked egg cannot be turned back into a raw egg.",
    "The student can use their drawing to show examples of reversible changes (like ice melting and refreezing) and irreversible changes (like an egg cooking).",
    "The student can label their drawings to identify changes caused by heating and cooling, and indicate which changes are reversible and which are not."
