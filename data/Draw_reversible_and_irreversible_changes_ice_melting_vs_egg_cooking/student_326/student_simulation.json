  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw an ice cube. I remember ice is often shown as a cube so I’ll sketch a simple cube to show the ice before it's heated. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle of water. That's what ice becomes when it's heated or melts, but I’m not sure how to show it can freeze again, so I’ll just leave it as water. Now, for the egg, I’ll sketch a basic oval shape for the raw egg. I'll draw another arrow pointing to a solid shape, like scrambled eggs or a fried egg, because the egg becomes solid when cooked. I remember this is an irreversible change, but I’m not sure how to show that in the drawing. I’ll just leave it as it is and hope it's clear enough.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, cartoonish style illustration, showing two side-by-side sections. On the left, draw a basic ice cube with an arrow pointing to a puddle of water, indicating melting. On the right, draw an oval shape to represent a raw egg with an arrow pointing to a solid yellow lump, representing scrambled eggs. Use simple colors: light blue for the ice cube, blue for the water puddle, white for the egg, and yellow for the cooked egg. Include arrows between the stages but without additional labels or complexities. Keep it clear but basic, showing some detail, like shading, for effort.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw the basic elements before and after heating—an ice cube turning into water and a raw egg into a cooked one—with simple arrows indicating change. It also reflects the student's struggle to accurately convey reversibility or irreversibility, as there are no signs of water refreezing or clarity on the egg being an irreversible change. The drawing includes some attempts at detail within these basic sketches, consistent with the student’s developing level of understanding."
