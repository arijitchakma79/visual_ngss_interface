  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can show a drawing of a material before heating, such as ice or a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating, like ice turning into water or an egg becoming solid during cooking.",
    "The student can depict whether the change is reversible or not, showing, for example, how melted water can freeze back into ice, while a cooked egg stays solid and cannot return to a raw state.",
    "The student can represent changes that occur after cooling, such as water turning into ice again, highlighting which changes are reversible.",
    "The student can clearly differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes through their drawings, showing both processes."
