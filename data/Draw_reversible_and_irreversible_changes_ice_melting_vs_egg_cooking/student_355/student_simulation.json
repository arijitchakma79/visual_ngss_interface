  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the appearance of a material before it is heated or cooled. On one side, I'll depict ice as a solid block, and next to it, I'll draw a raw egg. I remember that these are the starting materials. Now, I'll illustrate the changes after heating. I'll draw the ice turning into a puddle of water. I know this is a reversible change, so I'll make sure to add an arrow showing that the water can turn back into ice if it is cooled. For the egg, I'll draw it turning solid when cooked. To show itâ€™s irreversible, I won't draw an arrow going back. I'll add simple labels next to each: 'ice,' 'water,' 'raw egg,' and 'cooked egg.' Sometimes, I forget to use different colors consistently, so I might not distinguish them well with colors. I might also miss a label or make some arrows not very specific about what's happening, but I'll try to label the processes of heating and cooling. I think I should use blue for the ice and red for showing heat to make it clearer, although I might not do this everywhere.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing stages of reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, draw a block of ice in blue labeled 'ice' with an arrow labeled 'heat' pointing to a puddle of water. Next to water, another arrow labeled 'cool' pointing back to ice. On the right, draw a raw egg, labeled 'raw egg', with a red arrow labeled 'heat' pointing to a solid cooked egg, labeled 'cooked egg'. Use simple labels and arrows. Include mismatched use of colors or patterns, with some parts lacking distinctive colors, and occasionally incomplete arrows.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including drawings of ice and raw egg along with their changes upon heating. It suggests using arrows to show reversible and irreversible processes, aligning with the student's ability to label these changes. The prompt also reflects the student's struggles, like potentially inconsistent use of color and incomplete labeling or arrows, which are part of the things the student cannot do."
