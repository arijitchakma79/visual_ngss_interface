  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the appearance of a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice as solid, a raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the changes that occur after heating (e.g., ice turning into water, raw egg turning solid when cooked).",
    "The student can show changes that are reversed by cooling or heating again (e.g., melted ice turning back into solid ice).",
    "The student can portray changes that are not reversible by cooling or heating again (e.g., a cooked egg that does not return to a raw egg form).",
    "The student can depict a sequence showing both reversible and irreversible changes to draw distinctions between them.",
    "The student can use simple labels or arrows to indicate the processes of heating and cooling.",
    "The student can use different colors or patterns to enhance the understanding of reversible and irreversible changes."
