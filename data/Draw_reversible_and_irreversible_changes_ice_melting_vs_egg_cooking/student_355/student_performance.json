  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the appearance of a material before it is heated or cooled, such as depicting ice as a solid and a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes that occur after heating, like ice turning into water and a raw egg turning solid when cooked.",
    "The student can show that melted ice can turn back into solid ice through cooling, indicating reversibility.",
    "The student can portray a cooked egg as a change that is not reversible, demonstrating an understanding of irreversible changes.",
    "The student can use simple labels or arrows to indicate the processes of heating and cooling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently use different colors or patterns to enhance the understanding of reversible and irreversible changes (e.g., some parts may lack distinctive colors or patterns).",
    "The student might have incomplete labels or arrows, where some processes are labeled clearly, but others might lack specificity or be omitted altogether.",
    "The student might occasionally misplace an arrow with a minor gap in showing sequence, such as confusing the direction of a process arrow or missing an arrow entirely."
