  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice before and after it melts into water, and then back into ice, showing the reversible change.",
    "The student can draw a picture of an egg before cooking and after cooking to show the irreversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the steps of heating and cooling for a material, highlighting changes that can and cannot be reversed.",
    "The student can depict the process of heating chocolate until it melts and then cooling it to show that it becomes solid again, demonstrating reversible change.",
    "The student can include captions or labels that describe the materials before and after heating or cooling and state whether each change can be reversed.",
    "The student can represent cause and effect by using arrows or sequences to show how heating or cooling causes changes in materials."
