  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the process of ice melting and refreezing because that change is reversible. On the left, I’ll draw a simple cube of ice; that’s the ice before it melts. I’ll use blue to show the cold, solid ice. Next to it, I’ll draw a puddle of water and put an arrow pointing from the ice to the water with the label 'melting', showing how the ice changes into water. Then, I’ll draw another arrow from the water back to a new ice cube labeled 'freezing', showing that it becomes ice again. I remember that the process is reversible. Now I’ll draw cooking an egg. On the other side, I’ll draw a whole raw egg with a light brown shell. Next, I’ll draw a pan on a stove with the cracked egg in it, showing that it’s being cooked. I’ll put an arrow pointing from the raw egg to the cooked egg and label it 'heating'. I know cooking an egg is irreversible, but I have to remember to write that somewhere. Finally, I’ll include captions for the ice and egg processes, but I might miss one or two details. I have to be careful with the arrows—I tend to forget them sometimes or place them inconsistently.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, a blue ice cube melts into a puddle of water with an arrow labeled 'melting'. Another arrow shows the water refreezing into the ice with the label 'freezing', depicting the reversible change. On the right, a light brown egg is shown next to a pan on a stove containing a cracked egg being cooked. An arrow labeled 'heating' points from the raw egg to the cooked egg, indicating an irreversible change. Arrows are drawn in a cartoonish style, and the labels are clear but not overly detailed. The color scheme includes blues for the ice and browns for the egg.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by providing a detailed depiction of reversible (ice) and irreversible (egg) changes. The image reflects the student's ability to use arrows and labels to show processes, albeit not extensively detailed. The potential omission of some key labels or inconsistent application of arrows is acknowledged, capturing the proficiency level well."
