  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice before and after it melts into water, and then back into ice, showing the reversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the steps of heating and cooling for a material like chocolate, highlighting changes that can be reversed.",
    "The student can depict the process of cooking an egg, showing its irreversible change.",
    "The student can use arrows or sequences to show how heating or cooling causes the changes in materials.",
    "The student can include some captions or labels to describe the materials, although they may be incomplete or not fully detailed."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may forget to label all parts of the drawing, potentially missing a key label for the starting or ending material (ice, water, chocolate, or egg).",
    "The student might confuse the reversibility label, missing whether chocolate solidifying or egg cooking can be reversed (e.g., not clearly stating the egg cannot go back to being raw).",
    "The student might inconsistently apply the use of arrows or omit them for one part of the sequence, causing a slight gap in showing cause and effect."
