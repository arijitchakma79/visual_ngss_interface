  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can represent a material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can depict what happens to the material after heating, illustrating changes like ice melting to water or an egg cooking.",
    "The student can show whether the change is reversible or irreversible, such as melting ice that can refreeze versus a cooked egg that cannot become raw again.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling, noting changes like water turning into ice.",
    "The student can demonstrate through drawings if cooling or heating the material again reverses or maintains the change, like ice melting and refreezing or a cooked egg staying solid.",
    "The student can include visible changes that show an understanding of cause and effect, where heating or cooling leads to observable changes in the material.",
    "The student can accurately represent both examples: one that is a reversible change (like ice melting and refreezing) and one that is irreversible (like cooking an egg)."
