  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can represent a material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state, like ice in block form and a raw egg.",
    "The student can depict what happens to the materials after heating, illustrating ice melting into water and an egg turning solid.",
    "The student can show that ice melting is a reversible change by drawing water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can demonstrate, through drawings, that the cooled ice can refreeze, maintaining the change.",
    "The student can include visible changes and some understanding of cause and effect, such as steam from the cooked egg or melted ice water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently illustrate that a cooked egg is irreversibly changed, possibly depicting some elements inaccurately (e.g., suggesting the cooked egg returning to its raw form inadvertently).",
    "The student may not completely label all components involved in the changes, such as labels for different states or the presence of heat or cold inferences.",
    "There might be minor errors or omissions in showing temperature effects, like not showing the cold needed for refreezing the water into ice."
