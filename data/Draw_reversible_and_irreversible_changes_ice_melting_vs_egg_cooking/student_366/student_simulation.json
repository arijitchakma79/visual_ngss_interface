  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the ice in its solid block form. I remember that I need to show that ice can turn back into water, so I'll draw some water with the ice melting. Now, I’ll make sure to show that the water can turn back into ice, so I'll draw an arrow showing water turning back into an ice block again, because this is a reversible change. For the egg, I’ll sketch a raw egg next to a frying pan. I need to show it turning solid, so I'll draw a cooked egg in the pan. I know it's supposed to be an irreversible change, but I sometimes mix this up, so I’ll put an arrow back to the raw egg to show my thinking, even though it shouldn't go back. I’ll make sure to draw steam rising from the egg to show the heat, but I might forget to show cold for the ice refreezing. I’ll add some labels but might leave some parts unlabelled because I forget sometimes.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of ice melting and an egg cooking. On the left, there's a block of ice turning into water with an arrow indicating the reversible change of water turning back into ice. On the right, there's a raw egg next to a frying pan, and in the pan, a cooked egg with steam rising to show heat. An inaccurate arrow goes from the cooked egg back to the raw egg, showing misunderstanding of irreversibility. Parts are labelled 'ice', 'water', and 'egg', but not all elements are labelled, and the cold for refreezing is missing. The drawing style is simple and colorful, with colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can represent: the correct depiction of ice melting and partially-correct reversible change elements, along with steam to show heat. It also reflects the struggle with irreversibility in the egg cooking task, as an arrow back to the raw egg is drawn mistakenly. The omission of cold needed for refreezing illustrates a lack of understanding about temperature effects. Simple labels and some missing components also reflect the student's level of understanding."
