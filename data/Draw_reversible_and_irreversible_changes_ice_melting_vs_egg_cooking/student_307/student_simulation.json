  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw reversible and irreversible changes like ice melting and an egg cooking. First, I'll draw a block of ice. That's easy, I can make a big square or rectangle and shade it lightly to look cold and icy. Now, I should try to show that it's changing. Maybe I'll draw some smaller chunks next to it to show it's getting smaller. Hmm, I know ice turns into water, but I'm not sure how to show that well. I'll just keep the smaller pieces like it's breaking apart. For the egg, I'll draw an egg shape. I don’t remember if it should look different when raw, but I'll just draw an egg. Cooking it, well, I guess it gets white and solid, but I think maybe it can be undone, like ice melting. I won't draw any arrows or labels because I'm not sure how to show that. I’ll keep both drawings simple and maybe come back if I can think of something else to add.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child's drawing showing a big blue rectangular block representing ice, with smaller blue chunks beside it to indicate change. Next to it, an unlabelled drawing of a single egg shape colored white, attempting to suggest both raw and cooked states without clear differentiation. The style is naive and simplistic, with basic shapes and light colors.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's capabilities by including a basic drawing of a block of ice and a simple egg shape, which aligns with their ability to depict initial states with minimal detail. The depiction of smaller ice chunks instead of melted water reflects the student's misunderstanding of how to illustrate the transition to a liquid state. The lack of labels or arrows between drawings shows the student's difficulty in connecting cause and effect or illustrating the reversible nature of melting and the irreversibility of cooking."
