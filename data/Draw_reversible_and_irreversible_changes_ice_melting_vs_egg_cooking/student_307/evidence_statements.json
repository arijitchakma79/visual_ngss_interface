  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state (before heating or cooling) of a material, like ice or a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate what the material looks like after heating (e.g., ice becoming water, an egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can illustrate what the material looks like after cooling (e.g., water becoming ice again).",
    "The student can show which changes are reversible by drawing a change that can go back to its original state (e.g., melted ice refreezing into ice).",
    "The student can show which changes are irreversible by drawing a change that cannot return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg remaining solid).",
    "The student can label their drawings to represent cause and effect (e.g., heating causes ice to melt).",
    "The student can use the drawings to explain their reasoning about why some changes are reversible and others are not."
