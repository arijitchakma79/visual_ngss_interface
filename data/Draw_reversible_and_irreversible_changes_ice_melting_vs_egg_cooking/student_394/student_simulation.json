  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big rectangle to split my paper into two halves. On the left side, I’ll illustrate the reversible change of ice melting. I remember that ice is a solid, so I'll draw a few blocks with smooth edges and label it 'solid ice'. Then, I need to show heat turning the ice into liquid water. I’ll use an arrow pointing downwards to a puddle of water to indicate this change. I should depict water pooling around the ice. Next, I'll show that reversing the process can turn water back into ice. For that, I’ll draw another arrow going up from the water back to the ice, with a label like ‘freezing’. I can add a snowflake symbol to show cooling, but I might forget to label the temperature. On the right side, I’ll show the irreversible change of cooking an egg. First, I'll sketch a raw egg in a frying pan, making sure to draw the yolk and the egg white because it's liquid at the start. Then, I'll draw an arrow pointing to a cooked egg that's solid and different in color and texture. I know cooking is irreversible, so I'll write a note explaining that once cooked, an egg can’t go back to being raw. I’ll add arrows to show direction, but I might not label each stage explicitly. Even if I forget a few labels, I’ll make sure the main reversible and irreversible changes are definitely shown.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed science illustration displaying reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, show a sequence: a solid ice cube melting into a puddle of water at the bottom, with arrows indicating melting and freezing back into ice, including a snowflake symbol. On the right, depict a raw egg in a frying pan turning into a cooked egg, with arrows showing the progression. Include annotations or notes explaining reversibility for the ice and irreversibility for the egg, with multiple arrows indicating changes. Use simple labels but consider slight omissions like missing detailed temperature or stage labels. Use a colorful, illustrative style like a student’s drawing, with clear depictions of solid, liquid, and cooked states.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt includes both the reversible change of ice melting and freezing, and the irreversible change of cooking an egg, which the student can depict accurately. Arrows and symbols are mentioned to indicate changes, aligning with what the student can do. The prompt also suggests annotations to connect with reversibility concepts. It acknowledges potential omission of minor details like temperature labeling, consistent with the student's possible struggles or omissions."
