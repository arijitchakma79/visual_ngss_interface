  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a scenario where heat causes ice to melt into water and show water freezing back into ice to demonstrate a reversible change, including appropriate arrows or symbols to indicate the direction of change.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of an egg being cooked, with a clear depiction of an egg in the pan turning into a cooked egg, and explain why it cannot turn back into a raw egg, showing an irreversible change with labels.",
    "The student captures characteristic differences in materials before heating or cooling, such as ice being solid with a smooth surface and a raw egg being liquid with a yolk and egg white clearly depicted.",
    "The student depicts the changes in materials after heating or cooling, such as illustrating ice melt as water pooling beneath, and a cooked egg becoming solid and altering in color or texture.",
    "The student illustrates the result of reversing the heating or cooling process for materials that allow it, like providing a step with arrows showing water freezing back into ice, including temperature labels.",
    "The student uses the drawings to support the claims by showing which changes are reversible and which are not, connecting the observable evidence to these conclusions with captions or annotations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student, while highly proficient, may occasionally omit minor details such as labeling each stage of change explicitly (labels like 'liquid water', 'solid ice', or 'cooked egg').",
    "The student might inconsistently use arrows or symbols to indicate change direction and might miss a few in less crucial parts of the diagram, though the main ideas remain clearly communicated."
