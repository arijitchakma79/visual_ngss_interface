  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a scenario where heat causes ice to melt into water, and then show water freezing back into ice to demonstrate a reversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of an egg being cooked and depict why it cannot turn back into a raw egg, showing an irreversible change.",
    "The student can capture the characteristic differences in materials before heating or cooling, like ice being solid and a raw egg being liquid.",
    "The student can depict the changes in materials after heating or cooling, such as ice turning into liquid water and a cooked egg becoming solid.",
    "The student can illustrate the result of reversing the heating or cooling process for materials that allow it, like water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can use the drawings to support the claim by showing which changes are reversible and which are not, connecting the observable evidence to these conclusions."
