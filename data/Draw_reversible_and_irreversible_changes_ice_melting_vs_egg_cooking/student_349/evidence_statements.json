  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling to show its initial characteristics (e.g., ice as a solid, a raw egg in its liquid state).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change after heating is reversible or irreversible (e.g., water freezing back into ice, a cooked egg not turning back into raw egg).",
    "The student can show the material after it is cooled to demonstrate the changes (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change after cooling is reversible or irreversible (e.g., ice becoming water again, a plant leaf remaining dead after freezing).",
    "The student can use drawings to support the idea that some changes of state due to heating or cooling can be reversed, and some cannot."
