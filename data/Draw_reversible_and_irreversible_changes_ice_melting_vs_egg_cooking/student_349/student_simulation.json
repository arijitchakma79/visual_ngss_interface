  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I think ice looks kind of like a cube or a rectangle, so I'll make it bluish-white because ice is cold and kind of shiny and solid. Next, I'll draw an arrow leading to a puddle of water, this shows how the ice melts. I know to draw a small puddle, like a wiggly circle, and color it light blue. I'll also try to show that water can turn back into ice, so I’ll draw an arrow going back to another ice block. So far, I think this shows a reversible change because water can freeze back to ice. For the egg, I’ll draw a cracked egg. It has a bright yellow yolk and white part; it's a mix of yellow and whitish color, kind of like a slime. Then, I’ll draw an arrow from the raw egg to a fried egg, which I'll make yellow and white, showing it is getting cooked. I’m supposed to show that cooking an egg is irreversible, but I kind of think if it cools, maybe it goes back to raw, so I'll draw another arrow back to a raw-looking egg shape. I hope this is right, but I’m not sure about the reverse for the egg.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split image showing two processes: one on the left and one on the right. On the left, illustrate a reversible change: a solid block of ice, colored bluish-white, transitioning into a light blue puddle of water, with arrows indicating a back-and-forth change. On the right, depict an irreversible change with a cracked raw egg, featuring a white and yellow yolk, transitioning to a cooked fried egg. Arrows might show a confusing attempt to reverse the fried egg back to raw. Use bold outlines and a colorful, child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing captures the student's understanding and misunderstandings: the reversible nature of ice melting and freezing is shown correctly with arrows, while the irreversible cooking process is misunderstood by depicting a reversal from cooked egg back to raw. This aligns with their ability to show transition states and reversible processes, but also highlights their confusion around irreversibility, particularly with the egg."
