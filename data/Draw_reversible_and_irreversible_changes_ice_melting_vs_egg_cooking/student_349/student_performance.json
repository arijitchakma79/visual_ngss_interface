  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may be able to draw the initial state of materials, showing ice as a solid block and a raw egg as a liquid-like shape in a cracked shell.",
    "The student might illustrate ice melting into water with partial success, showing some transition from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can begin to conceptualize the idea of reversible and irreversible changes by showing water as a liquid freezing back to ice after cooling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to consistently illustrate the irreversible nature of a cooked egg, possibly showing a cooked egg turning back to a raw state (misunderstanding irreversibility).",
    "The student might not clearly represent cooling processes or may struggle with showing water returning to ice, sometimes indicating confusion by illustrating water remaining as a liquid (natural variation).",
    "The student might fail to differentiate well between reversible and irreversible processes in another context, occasionally showing mixed or incorrect symbols/icons to represent these changes."
