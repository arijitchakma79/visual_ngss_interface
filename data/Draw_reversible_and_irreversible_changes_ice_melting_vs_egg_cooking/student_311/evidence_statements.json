  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label a substance before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial state (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the substance after it is heated or cooled, indicating how it changes in appearance (e.g., ice melting into water, egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can depict the process of reversing the change, if possible, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can show an understanding that some changes are permanent by illustrating a change that cannot be reversed (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can use symbols or arrows to represent the process and direction of changes, distinguishing between reversible and irreversible processes.",
    "The student can provide captions or brief notes explaining the cause of the changes and whether they are reversible, demonstrating understanding of cause and effect."
