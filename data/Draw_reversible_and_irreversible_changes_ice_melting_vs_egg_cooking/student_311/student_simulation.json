  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing an ice cube. I know ice cubes are basically square, so I'll make a simple square shape. I think it's important to show water too, so I'll put some wavy lines next to the ice cube to look like water, but I might not know how to show the melting process well. For the egg, I'll draw an oval shape to look like a raw egg. Now, I need to show it cooking... hmm, maybe I'll just draw some squiggly lines around it like steam. I'm supposed to show something about reversible and irreversible changes, but I'm not sure how, so I'll leave it there. Next, I want to show what happens, so I'll draw an arrow from the ice cube to the water, but I'm confused â€“ should the arrow go both ways? And for the egg, I'll put an arrow from the raw egg to the cooked egg, even though I'm not sure if it should go the other way too. I'll label the ice as 'ice' and the egg as 'egg' but won't write anything else. I'm just going to try my best, but I'm not certain if what I'm showing makes sense.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with a blue square representing an ice cube and wavy blue lines next to it to show water. Next to it, draw a yellow oval for a raw egg with squiggly lines indicating it's cooking. Put straight arrows pointing from the ice cube to the water and from the raw egg to the cooked egg, both in red. Use minimal labels by writing 'ice' near the ice cube and 'egg' near the egg. The overall drawing should look childlike and basic, with primary colors and simple lines, representing a beginning understanding.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches what the student can do by including simple drawings of ice cubes and raw eggs with minimal labels. It also reflects what the student struggles with by inaccurately showing melting and cooking processes (such as incorrect or confusing arrows) and omitting detailed explanations of reversibility or irreversibility. The student attempts basic depictions but is likely to misunderstand directional representation of changes, as indicated by arrows. The childlike style aligns with a 'Beginning' level of understanding."
