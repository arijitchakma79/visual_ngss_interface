  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a simple picture of an ice cube and a raw egg, likely without labels or minimal labels.",
    "Attempt to draw the appearance of a melted ice or cooked egg but with significant inaccuracies or omissions."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Fail to illustrate the process of change accurately (e.g., draws ice cube and water side by side with no transformation shown).",
    "Misunderstand or omit the use of symbols or arrows to represent the direction of the change (e.g., no arrows or arrows pointing in the wrong direction).",
    "Not depict the irreversibility of a cooked egg or the reversibility of melted ice accurately (e.g., indicates a cooked egg can revert to raw).",
    "Provide little to no captions or incorrect notes explaining the process and its reversibility (e.g., writes 'egg becomes soup' or 'ice disappears').",
    "Confuse the initial and final states, possibly omitting the transition altogether or mixing them up (e.g., ice cube turning into an egg)."
