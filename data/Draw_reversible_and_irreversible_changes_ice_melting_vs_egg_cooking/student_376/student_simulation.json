  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the initial state of the materials to show the starting point before any changes occur. I remember that ice is solid, so I’ll draw a clear, blue ice cube to represent ice. For the egg, I’ll draw a whole raw egg with a light brown shell to highlight its original properties. Next, onto the change of states. I’ll illustrate the process of ice melting by drawing water droplets around the ice cube to show it gradually turning into liquid. For the egg, I’ll draw it in a frying pan, depicting it as a cooked egg with a sunny-side-up style to show it’s been heated. Now for reversibility, it’s critical to indicate that ice can refreeze. I’ll draw another small scene next to the melted water, showing it turning back into an ice cube in a freezer. This should demonstrate reversibility. For the egg, I know a cooked egg can’t turn back into a raw egg. So, I’ll show it as a permanent cooked egg. I'll label these changes, writing 'reversible' next to the ice illustrations and 'irreversible' next to the egg drawings. I understand how applying heat is a cause for change, so I’ll draw an arrow of flames under the ice and egg to show heat causing these transformations. However, I might forget to note the specific temperature conditions under which these changes occur, a minor detail sometimes hard to remember, but I believe my understanding of the concept is correct overall.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed, colored pencil-style drawing showing two panels. In the first panel, depict a solid blue ice cube starting to melt with droplets of water around it. Next to it, add a freezer scene showing the melted water turning back into an ice cube, labeled as 'reversible'. In the second panel, draw a raw brown egg next to it and an egg in a frying pan cooking in a sunny-side-up style. Label this change as 'irreversible'. Draw arrows and small flames under the egg and ice scenes to indicate heat application. The drawing should have clear labels distinguishing reversible and irreversible changes, without specific temperature conditions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student’s abilities as it showcases their capacity to illustrate and identify reversible and irreversible changes accurately. The addition of small details, like water droplets and flames, demonstrates an understanding of cause and effect related to heat and states of matter, while the absence of detailed temperature labeling reflects the student’s minor oversight tendency without impacting the overall conceptual understanding."
