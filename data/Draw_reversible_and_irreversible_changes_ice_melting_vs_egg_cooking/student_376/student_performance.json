  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the starting state of materials, accurately depicting ice as solid and a raw egg with its original properties.",
    "The student can illustrate the change of states when the materials are heated, with clear drawings showing ice melting into water and a raw egg being cooked.",
    "The student can clearly depict that ice can be frozen back into its original state, illustrating reversibility, while also showing that a cooked egg cannot revert to a raw state, demonstrating irreversibility.",
    "The student can accurately identify and label reversible changes (ice melting and refreezing) and irreversible changes (egg cooking).",
    "The student can effectively show cause and effect relationships in their drawings, such as how applying heat results in state changes, with explanations that indicate understanding of these processes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally forget to label minor details, such as the specific temperature conditions under which the changes occur *(minor oversight but not conceptual)*."
