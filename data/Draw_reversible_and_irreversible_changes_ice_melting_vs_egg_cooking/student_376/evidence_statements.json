  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting state of materials, like ice and a raw egg, showing their original characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the materials when they are heated or cooled, such as melting ice into water or cooking an egg.",
    "The student can depict the changes in the materials after they are heated or cooled and show whether these changes can be reversed (like water freezing back into ice) or not (like a cooked egg).",
    "The student can identify and label which changes are reversible (such as water to ice and back) and which are irreversible (such as a raw egg to a cooked egg).",
    "The student can show in their drawing the cause and effect relationship of heating and cooling on materials, providing explanations of the patterns observed."
