  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the initial state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw and label the changed state of a material after heating or cooling (e.g., water after ice melts, cooked egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the reversal of some changes by showing the material returning to its original state (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can depict that some changes cannot be reversed by showing that the material remains in its changed state (e.g., a cooked egg stays cooked).",
    "The student can use arrows and labels to illustrate cause and effect in their drawings (e.g., arrow showing ice melting due to heat).",
    "The student can include simple explanations or captions in their drawing to support their claim about whether a change is reversible or not."
