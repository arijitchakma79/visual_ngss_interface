  "Reasoning": "Alright, I'm supposed to draw reversible and irreversible changes with ice melting and an egg cooking. First, I’ll try to draw an ice cube. I think it's a square. I'll make that with my pencil. Now, ice melts into water, so I’ll try to draw some water next to it. I know water kind of spreads out, so maybe I'll draw a few squiggly lines for that. But did I remember to show it melting? I'm not sure how that works exactly. Maybe I should just make an arrow, but uh, I’ll point it randomly, I think. Now, for the egg. I remember eggs are oval, so I’ll start with an oval shape for the raw egg. Now, it's supposed to get cooked. I’ll draw another oval and color it yellow in the middle for yolk, but I’m not sure how to show that it went from raw to cooked. Should there be an arrow? I’ll just put one, but I don’t know where it should point. I forgot about the heat and how it affects the drawing. I need to label these, but I don’t really know what to write. Maybe I'll just skip it.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil drawing by a young student showing two separate scenarios. On the left, an ice cube is depicted as a simple square with a few squiggly lines beside it meant to represent water, with an arrow pointing randomly. On the right, a raw egg is shown as an oval shape, and next to it, an oval with a yellow center meant to be a cooked egg, with an arrow also placed randomly. The drawing is uncolored, except for the yellow in the cooked egg, and lacks any labels or captions to clarify the changes depicted.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to attempt basic shapes like a square for the ice cube and an oval for the egg. However, the student struggles with illustrating change and fails to use arrows correctly to convey the process. The image includes unorganized arrows and lacks labels, aligning with the student's lack of understanding in explaining these physical processes and their effects through drawing."
