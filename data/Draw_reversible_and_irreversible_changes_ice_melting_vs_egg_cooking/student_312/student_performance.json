  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a single ice cube and a single raw egg but might lack labels or clarity.",
    "The student might draw something resembling water and something resembling a cooked egg, though possibly with incorrect or missing labels."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly illustrate the concept of change (e.g., a simple cube with no melting context) *(student does not grasp the idea of transformation)*.",
    "The student is probably unable to accurately use arrows to depict cause and effect (e.g., placing an arrow pointing away from heat, indicating confusion on cause and effect) *(student misunderstands heatâ€™s role)*.",
    "The student is likely unable to show reversibility (e.g., ice refreezing into an ice cube) or irreversibility (e.g., a cooked egg reverting or staying the same) since these concepts are not yet understood.",
    "The student might provide little to no labels or captions to explain their drawing, leading to incomplete communication of ideas *(student does not know to label or explain changes)*."
