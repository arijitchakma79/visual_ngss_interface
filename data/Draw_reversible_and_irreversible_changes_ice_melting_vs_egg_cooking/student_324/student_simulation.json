  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw an ice block first because I know ice is involved. Let’s make it a simple square shape so it looks like a block of ice. I’ll try to add a bit of blue to show it’s ice. Now, I want to show the melting, so I’ll draw some lines coming down from it to look like water, but I’m not sure how to show it clearly changing. For the egg, I’ll draw an oval to represent a raw egg. Above it, I’ll try to add something that looks like a fried egg, maybe with a squiggly circle and a dot in the middle, but it might just look like another circle. I don’t really know how to show that an egg changes when cooked or can't change back. I’m not sure about writing words or using labels here; it seems confusing to me. I’ll just try adding some lines between the ice and water and maybe leave the rest as it is.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like image with a plain solid background. On one side, draw a simple blue square to represent an ice block. Draw some wavy lines underneath it to indicate water. Do not worry about showing a clear transformation. Next to it, draw an oval shape as a raw egg and beside it, a squiggly circle with a dot in the middle to represent a cooked egg. Avoid labeling or adding detailed captions, and do not show water turning back to ice or the cooked egg becoming raw again.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student is capable of, such as drawing basic shapes like a square for ice and an oval for an egg, with some color representing ice. It also reflects their struggle to accurately depict transitions or understand the reversibility concept, as shown by the lack of clear transformation and incorrect or missing label attempts. The drawing style is kept simple and unrefined to match the beginning level of understanding."
