  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of the material before heating or cooling (e.g., a block of ice, a raw egg).",
    "The student can depict the changes that occur to the material after heating (e.g., ice melting into water, cooking an egg).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the changes are reversible or irreversible (e.g., water can freeze back into ice, cooked egg cannot be returned to raw).",
    "The student can show the material's state after cooling, if applicable (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can include labels or captions that explain what is happening at each stage and whether the change is reversible or irreversible."
