  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a block of solid ice. I remember that I need to label it, so I'll write 'Ice, solid.' Next, I’ll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle beside the ice, showing the change to liquid water and label it 'Water, liquid.' I have to remember to draw arrows showing the change but sometimes I forget where they go. Now, I'll draw an arrow going back from the water to the ice to show that it can refreeze, but sometimes I forget to label these parts. For the egg, I’ll start by drawing a raw egg. I need to label it 'Raw egg.' I'll place an arrow pointing to an egg drawn as fully cooked and write 'Cooked egg.' I should remember to note that this is an irreversible change, but I sometimes think it’s obvious. Arrows should show how the egg changes with heat, but I might miss drawing or labeling one of them. I'm not always sure how to explain why the cooked egg can't become raw again, so I’ll just show the change clearly and hope it's understood.",
  "Prompt": "A colored drawing showing a science task: On the left, a clear illustration of a solid block of ice, labeled 'Ice, solid,' with an arrow pointing to a puddle labeled 'Water, liquid.' An additional arrow points back to the ice, with some inconsistency in labeling. Next, a drawing of a raw egg labeled 'Raw egg' with an arrow pointing to a cooked egg labeled 'Cooked egg,' indicating change due to heat. There are arrows showing changes with some missing labels. The style is a child's drawing, lively with colored pencils, indicating transitions with arrows and bold but simple labeling.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to create accurate drawings and labels for most elements, like ice turning to water and the cooking of an egg. It reflects their struggle with consistently labeling phases and indicating cause and effect, especially in the transition from liquid water back to ice and in explaining why an egg's change is irreversible, mirroring their proficiency level."
