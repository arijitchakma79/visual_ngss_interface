  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw solid ice and label it, showing it before heating.",
    "The student can illustrate liquid water with arrows indicating the transition from ice to water when heated.",
    "The student can draw and label a raw egg before cooking.",
    "The student can illustrate a cooked egg, indicating it has been heated.",
    "The student can depict the change from liquid water back to ice, showing it is reversible.",
    "The student can note that a cooked egg cannot return to its raw state, correctly depicting this as irreversible.",
    "The student attempts to show cause and effect, using arrows to indicate changes due to heating and cooling, mostly accurate with some minor inconsistencies."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label the phases of water, sometimes omitting labels or mixing them up.",
    "The student might omit a clear labeling of cause and effect for the egg's changes, sometimes assuming it's understood without visual cues.",
    "The student may not fully represent why the egg change is irreversible, showing the cooked egg but not always explaining it fully.",
    "There might be some inconsistency in drawing the transition from water back to ice, such as forgetting arrows or labels in some attempts."
