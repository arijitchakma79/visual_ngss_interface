  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial characteristics (e.g., solid ice, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing the changes (e.g., ice becoming liquid water, egg becoming cooked).",
    "The student can depict whether the change after heating is reversible, such as water freezing back into ice or showing that a cooked egg cannot become raw again.",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, demonstrating the changes observed (e.g., water turning into ice again, or other examples like a leaf not returning to normal).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change after cooling is reversible, showing understanding that some changes like ice melting can reverse, but cooked eggs cannot reverse to raw.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of cause and effect by showing the observable patterns resulting from heating and cooling."
