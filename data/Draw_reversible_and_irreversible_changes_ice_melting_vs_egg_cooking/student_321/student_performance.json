  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a cube to represent ice before a change, though it may look more like a random shape (limited drawing skills)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly illustrate ice turning into water; they might show the ice simply disappearing or not changing shape at all (may not understand the melting process).",
    "They may not draw water turning back into ice, or might depict ice turning into something unrelated like a solid egg (confusion between materials).",
    "The student may not show the raw to cooked egg transformation, or might draw a cooked egg as still the same as a raw egg (lack of understanding of irreversible changes).",
    "They probably will not depict or label the reversibility of changes; arrows might be missing entirely or point in random directions (no grasp of the concept of reversibility).",
    "The drawings may lack labels, or any existing labels might be incorrect or irrelevant to the task (not understanding cause and effect)."
