  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting materials before heating or cooling, like ice before melting or a raw egg before cooking.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating, such as ice turning to water or a raw egg solidifying.",
    "The student can show what happens to the material after cooling, like water freezing back into ice or how a cooked egg stays solid.",
    "The student can depict whether the changes are reversible, such as ice melting and refreezing, or irreversible, like a cooked egg staying solid.",
    "The student can label drawings to demonstrate understanding of cause and effect, showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes."
