  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before it is either heated or cooled, showing its original state.",
    "The student can depict what happens to a material after it is heated (e.g., ice turning to water, egg solidifying).",
    "The student can draw whether the change in the material is reversible, showing a reversible change such as water turning back to ice, or an irreversible change like a cooked egg staying solid.",
    "The student can illustrate a material after cooling to show how it may revert back to its original state, if possible (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can use drawings to show a change that cannot be reversed by cooling or heating (e.g., a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can represent an observable pattern caused by heating or cooling (e.g., the predictable pattern of ice melting and refreezing)."
