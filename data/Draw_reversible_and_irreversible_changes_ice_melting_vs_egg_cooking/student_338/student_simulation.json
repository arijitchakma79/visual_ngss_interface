  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw an ice cube because I know that's what the ice looks like before it changes. I'll make sure to draw it nice and solid. Then, I'll draw the ice melting into water. I remember that melting is a reversible change, so the ice can become water and then back to ice if I wanted. Now, for the egg, I know a raw egg is a clear liquid and has a yellow yolk floating inside. I'll draw it in a frying pan to show it before it's cooked. Then, for the cooked egg, I'll start drawing it more solid and white with a yolk that's changed too. I have to remember eggs can't turn back into raw once cooked, but sometimes I mix that up. I'll try to show everything I remember, but I might not show the ice refreezing back to solid or I might accidentally mix things up by showing a reversible change with the cooked egg. I need to show heating and cooling effects, but I sometimes forget those details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an ice cube on the left, solid and blue, then beside it, show water, clear and light blue, to represent melting. On the right, draw a raw egg in a frying pan, with a yellow yolk and transparent white. Next to it, show a cooked egg, with the white solidified and a yellow yolk, in the same frying pan. Use bright colors like blue for the ice and light yellow for the egg yolk. The style should be simple, with clear outlines and flat colors. Show some effort but keep it basic, focusing on the states before and after each change.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures what the student can do by illustrating the original states of ice and the raw egg, as well as their changes after heating. It aligns with the student's struggles by potentially omitting aspects of the reversible change, such as not clearly depicting the ice turning back into solid, and by not reversing the egg cooking process, which the student might confuse. Furthermore, the student's level of understanding might not include detailed visualization of heating and cooling effects, consistent with the basic drawing style and effort described."
