  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before it is either heated or cooled, showing its original state, such as a solid ice cube and a raw egg.",
    "The student can depict what happens to a material after it is heated, like showing ice turning to water or an egg beginning to solidify."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not clearly depict the full sequence of a reversible change, such as omitting the water turning back to ice step when illustrating reversibility (student doesnâ€™t clearly understand reversible processes).",
    "The student might incorrectly show a reversible process for an irreversible change, like drawing a cooked egg reverting back to a raw state (student may misunderstand irreversibility).",
    "The student may confuse the direction or cause of changes, such as showing no distinction in the drawing between heating and cooling effects (student may mix up heating with cooling processes).",
    "The student may not show or label observable patterns effectively, such as skipping temperature-related indicators in the drawings (student lacks clarity on visualizing patterns)."
