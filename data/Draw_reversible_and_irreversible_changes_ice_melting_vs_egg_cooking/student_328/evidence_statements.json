  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of materials before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can show the change that occurs when the material is heated (e.g., ice becomes water, egg becomes solid).",
    "The student can demonstrate whether the change is reversible or irreversible (e.g., water can freeze back into ice, cooked egg stays a solid).",
    "The student can depict the effect of cooling on the material and indicate if the original state can be restored (e.g., molten chocolate can solidify but remains in a different shape).",
    "The student can explain, through illustrations, that some changes are capable of being reversed by heating or cooling, whereas other changes are permanent."
