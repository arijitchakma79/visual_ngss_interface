  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate an ice cube before melting to indicate the initial state of a reversible change.",
    "Draw water after the ice has melted, suggesting some awareness of the change caused by heating.",
    "Show a raw egg to represent the initial state before cooking, indicating some understanding of an irreversible change."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently depict the transition from water back to ice to demonstrate full understanding of reversibility (may forget to show or label refreezing step).",
    "Clearly illustrate that a cooked egg remains solid and is an irreversible change (may confuse with reversible processes like freezing and melting water).",
    "Correctly show the effect of cooling on already cooked egg (may incorrectly depict the egg returning to its raw state).",
    "Explain changes through illustrations showing heating and cooling scenarios for both reversible and irreversible processes at the same time (may only partially or incorrectly illustrate one process)."
