  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before heating or cooling and describe its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after heating and describe whether it is reversible or not.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after cooling and explain if it can be reversed.",
    "The student can provide visual evidence to show how some changes (like ice melting) are reversible through heating and cooling.",
    "The student can show through drawings how other changes (like an egg cooking) are irreversible, even with further heating or cooling.",
    "The student can depict the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect it has on the state of the material.",
    "The student can connect their drawings to explain whether the observed changes support the claim about reversibility."
