  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw an ice cube before it melts. Ice is solid, so I'll make sure it's a square shape and label it 'ice cube.' I'll also draw a whole egg in its shell to show its state before cooking. Now, I'll show the ice melting into water, using arrows to indicate the change from solid to liquid. I know that this is reversible, so I'll also draw arrows showing water turning back into an ice cube when cooled. For the egg, I'll illustrate it in a frying pan to show it's being cooked. I'll label it 'cooked egg' to indicate the change. I remember this is irreversible, so I'll ensure the drawing makes that clear by not showing any 'reversal' arrows. I need to make sure I have arrows for heating the egg but might forget to label temperatures explicitly. I think I'm pretty accurate with showing these processes, even if I sometimes miss small details like temperature changes next to my drawings. Iâ€™ll write short notes next to my drawings to explain reversibility and irreversibility.",
  "Prompt": "An educational drawing of reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, depict a solid ice cube with a label 'ice cube,' turning into liquid water with directional arrows indicating the change, and reverse arrows showing water turning back to ice. On the right, draw an egg in its shell, then in a frying pan labelled 'cooked egg,' only showing arrows for heating, emphasizing its permanent state. Include annotations explaining the processes: 'Reversible: ice-water cycle' and 'Irreversible: egg cooking.' Use simple colors like blue for ice, white and yellow for the egg, and ensure the drawing appears hand-sketched with clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's advanced understanding of reversible and irreversible changes with detailed drawings of ice melting and an egg cooking. The prompt reflects the student's strengths, like accurately depicting processes with arrows and annotations, while noting struggles like occasionally missing minor details, such as explicit temperature labels. The hand-sketched style and use of simple colors align with the educational context and level of effort expected at this stage."
