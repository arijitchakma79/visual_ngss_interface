  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate a material before heating or cooling and describe its characteristics accurately (e.g., ice cube, whole egg in shell).",
    "Illustrate the changes in both materials accurately: ice melting into water and egg undergoing chemical change when cooked.",
    "Clearly show and label conditions for reversibility with ice, depicting the process of freezing and melting accurately.",
    "Depict with precision how the cooked egg remains in an altered state, even with attempts to cool or heat further.",
    "Incorporate visual cues such as arrows or labels to distinguish between the process of heating and cooling.",
    "Connect drawings with annotations explaining the scientific concept of reversibility, validating their depictions with accurate descriptions."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "May occasionally omit minor details in labeling, such as forgetting to label the temperature change explicitly next to the drawings.",
    "Could inconsistently explain or label transitions in temperature between heating and cooling processes with equal clarity."
