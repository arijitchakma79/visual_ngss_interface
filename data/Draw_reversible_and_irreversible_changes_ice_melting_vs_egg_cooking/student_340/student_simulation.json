  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw an ice cube and write the word 'ice' next to it. I know that ice is solid, so I’ll make sure my ice cube looks blocky and has sharp edges. Next, I'll draw the ice melting into water by drawing drips or little puddles around it and label 'water' nearby because it's liquid after it melts. I won't draw the water freezing back into ice because I'm not really sure how that works or remember to do it. Now for the egg, I'll draw a regular egg shape and label it 'egg.' I find it hard to show the egg cooking, so I might just leave it as it is without changes. I'll just make sure the egg looks like an egg with a shell. I forgot to label what's reversible or irreversible; I just think about drawing what I'm asked. I need to remember the water is a result of heating, but I'm working on showing sequence clearly. It's hard not to mix up what happens to the egg when it cooks.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of a science task showing reversible and irreversible changes. One side shows a simple, colored pencil sketch of an ice cube labeled 'ice' with water puddles labeled 'water' below it, indicating melting. The other side has a sketch of an intact egg labeled 'egg' with no changes shown, portraying lack of understanding of cooking. Labels are basic, without reversible/irreversible indicators. Colors include blue for ice and water, white for the egg, and yellow accents for labels. Drawing style is basic and beginner-level, with minimalistic details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities and misunderstandings: they can illustrate ice turning into water with basic labels but lack clarity on reversible changes and egg cooking. The prompt lacks a freezing process and doesn't show egg transformation, aligning with what the student struggles with. It prioritizes basic labels for states but omits deeper conceptual labels like 'Reversible' or 'Irreversible,' fitting the student's developing understanding level."
