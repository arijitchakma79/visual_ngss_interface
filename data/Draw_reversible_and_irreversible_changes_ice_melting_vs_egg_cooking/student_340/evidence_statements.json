  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial characteristics (e.g., an ice cube, a raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, demonstrating what changes occur (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg cooking into a solid form).",
    "The student can depict whether the changes after heating are reversible or irreversible (e.g., water can freeze back into ice, a cooked egg cannot return to a raw state).",
    "The student can show the material after cooling, illustrating what changes occur (e.g., water freezing into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate whether the changes after cooling are reversible or irreversible (e.g., ice can melt back into water).",
    "The student can use labels or simple notes to connect evidence to claim, indicating which changes can be reversed and which cannot (e.g., 'Reversible: ice to water to ice', 'Irreversible: raw egg to cooked egg').",
    "The student can illustrate the cause and effect in the drawing, showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes in the material."
