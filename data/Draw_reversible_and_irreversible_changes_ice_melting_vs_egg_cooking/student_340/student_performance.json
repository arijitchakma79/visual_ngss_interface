  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw an ice cube before heating, showing its solid state.",
    "Illustrate an egg in its raw form before any changes occur.",
    "Show ice melting into water, partially demonstrating the change due to heating.",
    "Include basic labels, such as 'ice' and 'water', to indicate states of matter before and after changes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Draw the process of water freezing back into ice clearly (may not realize this is a reversible change).",
    "Illustrate the egg cooking into a solid form accurately (might leave the egg unchanged or not show cooking effects).",
    "Indicate whether changes are reversible or irreversible with labels (e.g., forgets to label 'Reversible' or 'Irreversible').",
    "Illustrate cause and effect clearly, such as showing how heating results in observable changes (may draw sequence incorrectly or without emphasis on heating)."
