  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube, because the task is about changes in ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I’ll draw a square with light blue color to look like an ice cube. Then, I’ll draw an arrow pointing from the ice cube to the melted water. I'll make the melted form blue and wavy to show it's now liquid water. Now, I’m supposed to show the original state of an egg, so I’ll draw an egg with a light brown shell next to it. I know eggs change when they cook, so I draw another arrow pointing to a sunny-side-up egg. I think that’s how I show change. But I’m not sure how to draw the water turning back into ice, so I guess I won’t include that. I'll try to draw another arrow trying to show the cooked egg going back to raw, but I’m unsure if that’s possible, so it's a bit unclear. I have some arrows drawn, but they might not be clear enough to show exactly what’s causing the change, like the heat or cold. I hope that shows some changes correctly!",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing illustrating reversible and irreversible changes in a simple and colorful style. On the left, there is a light blue cube representing ice, next to it an arrow pointing to a small puddle of wavy blue lines depicting melted water. On the right, a light brown egg with a smooth shape is shown in its raw state, with an arrow leading to a sunny-side-up egg with yellow yolk and white surrounding it. An unclear, incomplete arrow is attempting to hint the egg turning back to raw, lacking clarity. There are sparse labels or arrows, showing some understanding of change but with missing parts for full explanation.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate the initial and changed states of both ice and an egg, demonstrating their understanding of reversible and irreversible changes at a basic level. The missing steps, like water refreezing, align with the student's struggle to show reversible processes fully. Attempts to reverse the cooked egg back to its raw state and the lack of clear causative arrows illustrate a misunderstanding of irreversible processes and unclear depictions of cause and effect, matching the list of struggles outlined."
