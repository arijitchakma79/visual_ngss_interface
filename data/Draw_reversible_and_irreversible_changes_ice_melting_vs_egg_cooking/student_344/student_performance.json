{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate ice as a solid before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can draw ice melting into water, showing that a change has occurred.",
    "The student can illustrate an egg in its original raw state before cooking, indicating an awareness of its starting condition."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might have difficulty illustrating the water refreezing into ice correctly, possibly omitting this step altogether.",
    "The student may incorrectly show an attempt to reverse the cooked egg back to its raw state, indicating a misunderstanding of irreversibility.",
    "Illustrations of cause and effect might be unclear, such as missing arrows or labels showing what causes the change (e.g., heat or cold).",
    "The student might not effectively identify patterns in reversible and irreversible changes, potentially confusing the two processes."
