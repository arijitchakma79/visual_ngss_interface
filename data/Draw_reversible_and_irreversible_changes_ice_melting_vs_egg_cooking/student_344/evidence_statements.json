  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material as it appears before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes observed in the material after it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice becomes water, an egg becomes solid).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens when the heated or cooled material is returned to its original temperature state, showing whether the change is reversible (e.g., liquid water becomes ice, cooked egg does not revert).",
    "The student can identify and illustrate the reversibility or irreversibility of the change by showing the material's final state after cooling or heating is reversed (e.g., ice that melts can refreeze, but a cooked egg remains solid).",
    "The student can use their drawing to explain the cause and effect of heating or cooling on the material, identifying observable patterns in reversible and irreversible changes."
