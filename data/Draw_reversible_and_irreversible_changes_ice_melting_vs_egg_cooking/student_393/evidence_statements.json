  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state (e.g., ice cube and raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens when the material is heated, depicting the reversible change from ice to water and the irreversible change of an egg cooking.",
    "The student can show the change of the material when cooling is involved, such as water freezing back to ice.",
    "The student can illustrate that some changes caused by heating (like once the egg is cooked) cannot be reversed by cooling it again.",
    "The student can use cause and effect in their drawing to show how heating or cooling causes changes in the material, some of which can be reversed, while others cannot."
