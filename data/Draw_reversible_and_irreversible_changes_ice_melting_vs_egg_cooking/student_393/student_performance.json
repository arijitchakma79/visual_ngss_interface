  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the initial states of the materials, accurately depicting an ice cube and a raw egg right before heating.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of heating, clearly showing the reversible change of ice melting into water and the irreversible change of an egg cooking.",
    "The student can accurately depict water freezing back into ice, showing an understanding of the reversible change involved with cooling.",
    "The student can demonstrate that the changes from heating an egg are irreversible, showing that the cooked egg cannot be reverted back to its raw state by cooling.",
    "The student effectively uses cause and effect in their drawings to indicate how heating and cooling affect the materials, distinguishing between changes that can be reversed and those that cannot."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There is minimal the student cannot represent accurately, but they might occasionally leave out minor details such as labeling the state of water (liquid) after melting if not prompted.",
    "The student may inconsistently apply arrows or labels to show the direction or effect of the changes, although understanding is present."
