  "Reasoning": "I’ll start my drawing by sketching an ice cube and a raw egg to show the starting materials for both changes. I remember the ice cube is solid and the egg is liquid inside. I'll use blue for the ice cube to show its coldness and a white and yellow color for the egg. Next, I'll draw the process of heating these items. For the ice cube, I'll show it melting into water by drawing water droplets and use an arrow pointing downwards and label it 'melting.' I'll remember to use a clear liquid color for the water. According to what I learned, melting is reversible, so I'll draw the water in a container being put in the freezer, and I’ll show an arrow going back to an ice cube labeled 'freezing,' remembering to use blue again for the ice cube. For the egg, I'll illustrate it cooking by drawing steam and bubbles around it. I won’t forget to draw the cooked egg with a solid texture. I know a cooked egg cannot become raw again, so I’ll use an arrow pointing downward only and label it 'cooking'. I need to remember that arrows and labels can help show the change process, so I’ll try to use them accurately, but I sometimes forget to add all the labels. Overall, I am confident I can make the different effects of heating and cooling clear, even if I occasionally miss a label or two.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing showing two parallel processes: on one side, an ice cube melting to water and then refreezing to ice. The ice cube is solid and blue, water is liquid and clear in a container, and arrows with labels 'melting' and 'freezing' indicate the changes. On the other side, a raw egg cooking. The egg is white with a yellow yolk, surrounded by steam/bubbles while cooking, and finally depicted as a solid cooked egg. Arrows are used with the label 'cooking'. The drawing uses bright colors, cartoon style, and arrows and labels to depict processes and states.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to represent initial states accurately and depict reversible processes of ice melting/freezing correctly, with achievable understanding of irreversible egg cooking. Arrows and labels show cause-effect, while admitting the student might overlook minor labels or inconsistently apply them. The use of color and style reflects a student's effort at the advanced level."
