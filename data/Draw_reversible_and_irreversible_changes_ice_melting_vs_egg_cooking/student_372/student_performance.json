  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of both ice (solid form) and a raw egg correctly.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting into water and the raw egg becoming cooked when heated.",
    "The student can depict that water can refreeze into ice (correctly showing reversible change).",
    "The student can label the stages and indicate the cause (temperature change) for most parts of the task."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently show the irreversible nature of a cooked egg not returning to its raw state *(may forget to show cooked egg remains solid)*.",
    "The student might not fully label all effects of the heating and cooling processes or may miss some cause-effect relationships *(e.g., doesn't label temperature change arrows)*."
