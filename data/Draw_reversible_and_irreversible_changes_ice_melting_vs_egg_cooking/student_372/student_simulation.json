  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the initial state of both the ice and the egg. I remember that ice is a solid, so I'll draw a cube to show that, and for the egg, I'll draw an oval shape with a little bit of texture to show it's raw. Next, I'll illustrate the process of the ice melting into water. I know this is a reversible change, so I’ll make sure to draw arrows showing ice turning into water and label these stages. Then, I'll draw the egg on a frying pan to show it's being cooked. This is irreversible because once heated, an egg can’t go back to being raw. I’ll label these parts too, but I might forget to show the solid form of the cooked egg. I’ll try to remember to draw arrows for temperature changes where I can but sometimes I miss these details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with an ice cube and a raw egg side by side. On the left, the ice cube is shown as a clear, light blue, solid cube. To its right, illustrate a puddle of water with an arrow going back and forth between the two to indicate reversibility. Label them 'ice' and 'water'. Beside them, draw a raw egg with a white shell and beside it, a sunny side up egg on a frying pan with steam. Arrows go from egg to cooked egg. Use thin black lines for contours, simple labels, and soft colors for a classroom sketch feel.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student’s ability to start with the initial solid forms of ice and egg and show the transformation processes. It reflects the understanding of reversible changes by showing the refreezing of water into ice, depicted with arrows and labels. However, it acknowledges the student's partial presentation of irreversibility by not fully emphasizing the cooked egg's solidity. The suggestion of simple labeling and some missed details for temperature change arrows aligns with the student's ability to illustrate proficiently, while still capturing occasional gaps in the depiction."
