  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of a material before heating or cooling, such as ice or a raw egg.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated or cooled, like ice turning into water or an egg becoming cooked.",
    "The student can depict the result if the temperature change is reversed, showing which changes are reversible (e.g., water freezing back into ice) and which are not (e.g., a cooked egg staying solid).",
    "The student can visually differentiate between reversible changes (ice and water) and irreversible changes (raw and cooked egg) in their drawing.",
    "The student can label the cause and effect of the temperature change, showing the pattern of change for each material."
