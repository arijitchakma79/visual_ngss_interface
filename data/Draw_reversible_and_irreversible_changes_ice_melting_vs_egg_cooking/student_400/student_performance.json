  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw an ice cube before it is heated, showing its solid state with clear labels.",
    "The student can illustrate the melting process of ice turning into water, using cause-and-effect arrows to show the change.",
    "The student can depict the reversibility of ice melting by illustrating water freezing back into ice, correctly labeling the process.",
    "The student can accurately draw a raw egg before cooking, showing its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of a raw egg turning into a cooked egg, with clear cause-and-effect arrows.",
    "The student can depict that a cooked egg cannot be reverted to its raw state, indicating the irreversible nature of this change.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate cooling changes, such as melted chocolate solidifying, and show this process with arrows.",
    "The student can demonstrate that the solidification of chocolate can be reversed by heating, returning to its melted state, through accurate drawing and labeling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor labels or details, such as forgetting to label 'heat' or 'cool' on arrows (minor oversight, generally understands process).",
    "The student might occasionally draw arrows that are slightly misplaced or misaligned, though they still convey the correct relationship between cause and effect (inconsistency but understanding is evident)."
