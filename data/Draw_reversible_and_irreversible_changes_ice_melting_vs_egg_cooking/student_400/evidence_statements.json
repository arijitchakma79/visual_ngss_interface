  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after it is heated (e.g., ice turning into water, egg turning solid).",
    "The student can depict whether the heating change can be reversed, showing the material going back to its original form if possible (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the heating change cannot be reversed, indicating the material stays in the new form (e.g., cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can draw the change in the material after it is cooled, if applicable (e.g., melted chocolate solidifying).",
    "The student can show if the cooling change can be reversed by heating, returning the material to its prior state (e.g., solid chocolate melting).",
    "The student can depict if the cooling change cannot be reversed by heating, indicating the permanence of the new state (e.g., dead plant leaf remains unchanged).",
    "The student can use cause-and-effect arrows to demonstrate the relationship between heating/cooling and the changes in the materials."
