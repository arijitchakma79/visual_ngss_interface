  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw and label a picture of an ice cube before and after it is heated, clearly showing the ice melting into water.",
    "Draw and label a raw egg before it is cooked and an egg after it is cooked, correctly illustrating the change.",
    "Illustrate the process of melted water refreezing back into an ice cube, representing reversibility.",
    "Provide a basic argument explaining why the melting of ice cubes is reversible while egg cooking is not, using drawings as evidence."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Provide a completely accurate explanation of why egg cooking is irreversible, as explanations may lack depth (e.g., only partially explaining why a cooked egg cannot return to a liquid state).",
    "Consistently label all parts and stages in their drawings, occasionally missing a label or inaccurately identifying a stage (e.g., labeling a warmed-but-not-yet-liquid ice cube as 'melting' when it's still visibly solid)."
