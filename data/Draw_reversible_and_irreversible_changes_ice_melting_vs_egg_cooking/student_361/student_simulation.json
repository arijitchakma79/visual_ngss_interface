  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw an ice cube. I remember it should look like a blue or white square to show it's frozen. Then, I'll draw the same ice cube melting. I'll add some water dripping down to indicate melting and maybe a puddle at the bottom. Next, I'll put an arrow and draw the water freezing back into an ice cube. I know this is reversible because I can freeze water again. Now for the egg, I need to draw a raw egg first. I'll sketch an egg with a yellow yolk and clear white. After that, I'll draw the egg cooked with a white solid part and yellow in the middle. The change here is not reversible, but I have to show that with my drawings. I should use labels to explain each stage, though sometimes I forget or get them mixed up a bit. I'll label the ice stage 'ice cube', 'melting ice into water', and 'refrozen ice', even if I might call all melted ice 'water'. For the egg, I will label 'raw egg' and 'cooked egg', but I find it hard to explain why it can't return to raw.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two panels side by side. The left panel shows a blue ice cube that is melting with a few water droplets and a small puddle beneath it. Include an arrow pointing to another ice cube on the same side representing refreezing. Label the stages as 'ice cube', 'melting water', and 'refrozen ice'. The right panel shows a raw egg with a clear white and a yellow yolk, next to a cooked egg with a solid white and yolk in the middle. Label these as 'raw egg' and 'cooked egg'. Use bright and simple colors with handwritten labels. The style is a child-like drawing with simple outlines and bold, primary colors, showing effort but slight imperfections.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt aligns with the student's capability to illustrate reversible and irreversible changes using drawings. The student can clearly show ice melting and refreezing, which is correctly labeled as reversible. The drawing reflects the student's partial ability to label stages correctly, as well as their difficulty in comprehensively explaining or labeling the irreversible egg change process. The inclusion of simple labels and straightforward imagery represents the student's proficient but not perfect level, accounting for minor mistakes or missing depth in the explanation."
