  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw an ice cube on one side of the page. In front of it, I’ll draw a little sun to show that heat will melt the ice. I'll sketch arrows indicating the process of melting, but I might forget them if the diagram becomes too complex. Next, I'll draw a puddle of water to show the ice cubes have melted. I'll make sure to label these diagrams as 'ice cube' and 'melted water.' Now, for the reversible process, I want to show that the process can go backwards, so I’ll add a diagram of the water turning back into ice with labels, using an arrow pointing back to the ice cube and a snowflake to symbolize freezing. Now, for the egg, I’ll start with a drawing of a raw egg in a frying pan, then draw a stove beneath it to indicate cooking. Next, I’ll draw the egg cooked and label each step. To show that this isn’t reversible, I’ll include a failed attempt at reversing the cooked egg back to a raw state with a circle and slash indicating 'not possible.' I need to make sure my labels say which changes are reversible and which are irreversible. I might miss adding labels to some small details if it gets crowded. I’ll use arrows to show the direction of change, but might leave one out if things get too busy.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed science diagram depicting two processes: 'reversible change' and 'irreversible change'. In the top half of the page, illustrate an ice cube on a sunny day with yellow sun rays melting into a blue puddle, then transforming back into an ice cube with a snowflake indicating freezing. Show arrows and appropriate labels for 'melting ice' and 'freezing water.' In the bottom half, draw a raw egg in a gray frying pan on a black stove, transitioning to a cooked egg, with a red circle and slash over an additional diagram trying unsuccessfully to reverse the process, labeled 'irreversible change.' Use clear captions for each phase. Make sure the drawing is colorful, clear, with a mix of hand-drawn and digital aesthetics, and clear depiction of processes with some omitted arrows or labels if the drawing is too complex.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's ability to produce an advanced depiction with a complete narrative of the processes, as described in the 'CAN' section. The specific inclusion of the sun, egg on stove, and snowflake shows causes and effects, while using visual symbols like arrows and the circle-slash highlights process outcomes. Potential omissions in labeling or arrows reflect limitations noted in the 'CANNOT' section, aligning with forgetting some details in a complex diagram."
