  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a before-and-after sequence of an ice cube melting into water, clearly showing the reversibility of this change.",
    "The student can effectively illustrate water freezing back into ice, depicting the process as reversible with clear labels.",
    "The student can depict an egg being cooked from raw to solid, demonstrating the irreversible nature of this change with clear illustrations.",
    "The student can create a detailed diagram showing unsuccessful attempts to reverse a cooked egg to its raw state, underscoring its irreversibility.",
    "The student can include comprehensive labels or captions that correctly describe whether each change is reversible or irreversible.",
    "The student can use drawings to effectively indicate the causes and effects of heating or cooling, such as a sun for melting ice and a stove for cooking an egg.",
    "The student can accurately depict observable characteristics of materials before, during, and after heating or cooling, showcasing their understanding of the concept."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally neglect to label less obvious aspects of the drawing if there are too many details presented at once.",
    "The student may inconsistently use directional arrows to indicate processes, though they mostly understand their importance (e.g., may forget in a complex diagram)."
