  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a before-and-after sequence of an ice cube melting into water to show a reversible change.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of freezing water back into ice to represent reversibility.",
    "The student can depict an egg being cooked from raw to solid to show an irreversible change.",
    "The student can create a diagram demonstrating attempts to reverse a cooked egg back to its raw state, highlighting its irreversibility.",
    "The student can include labels or captions that describe whether each change is reversible or irreversible.",
    "The student can use drawings to indicate the causes and effects of heating or cooling in their examples (e.g., sun for melting ice, stove for cooking an egg).",
    "The student can depict observable characteristics of materials before, during, and after heating or cooling to show understanding of the evidence."
