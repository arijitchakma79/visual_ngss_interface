  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw an image showing what happens to ice before, during, and after melting, emphasizing that this change is reversible.",
    "The student can illustrate a raw egg being cooked and demonstrate that the change to a cooked egg is irreversible.",
    "The student can represent the cause and effect of heating and cooling on materials, using examples like melting ice to show patterns.",
    "The student can show in their drawings the observable characteristics of materials before and after heating or cooling.",
    "The student can connect their drawings to the idea that heating and cooling can result in changes that are either reversible or irreversible, using evidence such as water freezing back into ice and a cooked egg staying solid."
