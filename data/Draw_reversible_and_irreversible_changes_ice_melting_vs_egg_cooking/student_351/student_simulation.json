  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing ice. I think of a cube of ice, and I'll draw it with straight lines and maybe add a bit of blue to show it's cold. Next, I'll draw the ice melting into water. I should show an arrow going back, to show the water can freeze into ice again. Now, I'll draw a raw egg. I'll sketch an egg with a yolk and a runny white. Then I'll draw the cooked egg next to it – I'll shade the white a bit to show it's solid now. I think I have to show that the egg can't go back to being raw, but I might forget to write 'irreversible.' Next, for heating and cooling, I'll draw a little sun near the ice to show it's melting because of heat. But I could forget to draw something showing the ice can freeze again, maybe like a snowflake or something. I’ll try my best to remember, but sometimes I overlook these parts.",
  "Prompt": "A child's science drawing depicting reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, a blue-tinted, angular ice cube is shown melting into a small puddle of water, with arrows indicating the change can go back and forth. On the right, a representation of a raw egg with a soft yolk and runny white next to a cooked egg with a solid white, emphasizing the change. Above the ice, a small sun symbol suggests heat, but no symbol for freezing. The drawing should be colorful and somewhat realistic, capturing effort, with minor omissions.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by showing a clear depiction of a reversible change with arrows and some understanding of heat causing the changes, as in the melting ice. The student's struggle to highlight irreversibility is reflected in the absence of extra labels or symbols permanently distinguishing the cooked egg, as well as overlooking symbols for cooling, demonstrating an incomplete depiction of temperature effects."
