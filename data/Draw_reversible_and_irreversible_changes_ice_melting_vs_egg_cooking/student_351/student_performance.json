  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw clear images of ice before, during, and after melting, showing this change as reversible (e.g., with arrows indicating the process can go back and forth between ice and water).",
    "The student can illustrate a raw egg and a cooked egg, demonstrating that cooking is an irreversible process (e.g., by showing the egg white changing texture).",
    "The student can represent heating as a cause leading to changes, like ice melting or eggs cooking, with reasonable accuracy.",
    "The student can partially connect the idea of change to reversibility, showing that water can freeze back into ice, even if not fully explaining the science behind it."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might struggle with consistently showing the change from a raw egg to a cooked one is permanent, possibly not emphasizing the irreversibility (e.g., forgetting to label or missing a detail on structural changes).",
    "The student might show a general but incomplete understanding of cause and effect by not emphasizing cooling's role in reversing changes, such as freezing water (e.g., forgetting to depict freezing)."
