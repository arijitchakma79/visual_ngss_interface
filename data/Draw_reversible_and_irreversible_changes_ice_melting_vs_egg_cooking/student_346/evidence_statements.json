  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a before-and-after illustration showing what the material (ice or egg) looks like before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can draw what happens to the material (ice or egg) when it is heated or cooled, showing the changes clearly.",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change in the material is reversible or irreversible by attempting to depict the process of reversing the change (e.g., drawing the ice refreezing or showing that a cooked egg cannot return to a raw state).",
    "The student can illustrate a pattern or link between cause (heating or cooling) and effect (change in material state), using labels or arrows to show these relationships.",
    "The student can include captions or labels in their drawing that clearly explain whether the change is reversible or irreversible, based on their observation.",
    "The student can show in their drawing the characteristics of the materials (ice or egg) before and after the change, using details to highlight differences and similarities."
