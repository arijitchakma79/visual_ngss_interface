  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a before-and-after illustration showing basic differences in what the ice and egg look like before and after heating or cooling. (e.g., ice as a solid block and a puddle of water, raw egg as a whole egg and cooked egg as scrambled or fried)",
    "The student can partially draw what happens to the ice and egg when heated or cooled, but the details may be simplistic or lack clarity. (e.g., ice melting into water but might not show it clearly flowing)",
    "The student can attempt to show the change as reversible for ice by drawing it refreezing, though details might be unclear or inconsistent."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot fully illustrate whether the egg change is irreversible, and might incorrectly depict the egg returning to a whole or raw state. *(misunderstanding that cooked eggs cannot be uncooked)*",
    "The student may not clearly illustrate a pattern or link between cause (heating or cooling) and effect (change in material state); arrows may be missing or incorrectly pointed. *(low understanding of cause-effect relationship)*",
    "The labeling or captions may be minimal or incorrect, lacking clarity on whether the changes are reversible or irreversible. *(student does not effectively communicate their observation)*",
    "The student may inconsistently or incorrectly show characteristics of materials before and after the change, lacking detail or accuracy in changes. *(incomplete understanding of material properties)*"
