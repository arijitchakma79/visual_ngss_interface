  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the ice. I remember ice is solid, so I'll draw a blue block of ice. Now, I’ll show it melting into water. I think I should draw some small puddles next to the ice block. But I’m not sure how to show the water flowing very well. Oh, I can attempt to draw the ice refreezing by adding a jagged outline around a blue block of water, but maybe it doesn’t look super clear. Next, I'll draw the egg. First, I'll sketch an oval for the raw egg. I know when an egg is cooked, it looks scrambled, so I'll draw squiggly yellow lines for scrambled eggs. I remember that once an egg is cooked, you can’t un-cook it, but it’s hard, so maybe my drawing makes the egg look like it turns back into a whole egg. I'm not sure where to draw arrows or how they show heating or cooling, so I'll probably leave them out or accidentally point them the wrong way. I should label these as 'before' and 'after' images, but I'm a little unsure about making the labels clear enough to show which changes are reversible or irreversible.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing of reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, a simple, blue, solid block of ice next to small droplets of water on white paper. On the right, a raw egg shown as an oval in light brown, next to scrambled egg depicted with scribbled yellow lines. An attempt to draw refreezing includes jagged blue outlines, but lacks clarity. Labels say 'before' and 'after,' inadequately distinguishing between reversible and irreversible changes. No arrows indicating cause and effect, or arrows might be placed incorrectly.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt includes a basic depiction of ice as a block melting into water and potentially refreezing, but lacks clear detail, reflecting the student's emerging understanding. The egg is shown transitioning from a whole to a scrambled state but does not adequately demonstrate the irreversibility, aligning with misunderstandings. Labels are present but not sufficiently explanatory, illustrating the student's difficulty in communicating observations clearly."
