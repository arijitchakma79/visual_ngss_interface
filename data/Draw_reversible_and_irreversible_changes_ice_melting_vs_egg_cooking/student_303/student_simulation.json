  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw reversible and irreversible changes with ice melting and an egg cooking. I'll start with drawing an ice cube because I know what that looks like. It's like a small square. Now, maybe I'll add some water next to it since ice turns into water when it melts, right? But I don't really know how to show it melting and going back to ice. I'll label it as 'Ice' and 'Water', though. For the egg, I know what a raw egg looks like, so I'll draw the oval shape. But now I need to show it cooking. I think I'll just draw lines around it to show something is happening, and maybe draw a pan under it. I'll write 'Egg' next to it. I don't really know how to make it look cooked, and I think if I draw the yellow yolk it might show it's still liquid. I guess the egg might go back to normal, like how ice turns back to solid? Eh, I don't know, I'll just leave it like that.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like picture showing an ice cube as a blue square and some blue water next to it with labels 'Ice' and 'Water'. Next to it, draw an oval to represent an egg with wavy lines around it and a brown oval under it, meant to symbolize a pan. Label it 'Egg'. Use basic colors and line drawings, and don't include complex details like a cooked egg or melting states.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes and some labels like 'Ice' and 'Egg'. It captures their struggle to depict the processes of melting and cooking and their misunderstanding of reversible and irreversible changes by not showing transitions or differentiating well between the two states."
