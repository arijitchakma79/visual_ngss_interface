  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a simple picture of an ice cube and possibly water, but may not clearly show melting or refreezing process.",
    "Draw an egg but struggle to depict any change, such as cooking."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Correctly show ice melting and refreezing process (student may not understand the change from solid to liquid and back).",
    "Illustrate the change of the egg from liquid to solid when cooked (student doesnâ€™t grasp the concept of cooking causing a change).",
    "Demonstrate that cooking an egg is irreversible (student may try to show egg turning back to liquid).",
    "Label parts of the drawing correctly to indicate stages of changes (student may incorrectly label or omit labels).",
    "Identify reversible vs irreversible changes with accuracy (student likely confuses the two or shows random guesses)."
