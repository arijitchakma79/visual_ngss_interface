  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw two panels: one showing ice melting and refreezing, and another showing an egg being cooked.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in ice when heated, from solid to a liquid state.",
    "The student can show the reversible change by illustrating water being refrozen back into ice.",
    "The student can depict the change in an egg when heated, from a liquid to a solid state.",
    "The student can demonstrate that the change in the egg is irreversible by showing that the cooked egg cannot return to its original state.",
    "The student can label each stage of change to highlight the material characteristics before and after heating or cooling.",
    "The student can use drawings to identify that some changes are reversible and some are not, based on the heating and cooling process."
