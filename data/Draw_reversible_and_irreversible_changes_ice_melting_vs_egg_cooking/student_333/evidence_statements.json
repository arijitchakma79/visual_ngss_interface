  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing its initial state (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, demonstrating the change (e.g., melted water, cooked egg).",
    "The student can depict whether the heated material can be reversed by cooling (e.g., water freezing back into ice, the cooked egg remaining solid).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling, showing the results (e.g., water frozen back into ice, unchanged cooked egg).",
    "The student can show the concept of reversibility by depicting changes that go back to their original form (e.g., melted chocolate becoming solid again).",
    "The student can represent irreversible changes with drawings that demonstrate the final form cannot return to the initial state (e.g., cooked egg can't become raw again)."
