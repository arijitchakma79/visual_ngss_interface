  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing what an ice cube looks like before it melts. I remember it's a solid block of ice, so I'll make a simple square shape, maybe with some shading to show it's a cube. Next, I need to show the ice after it's melted, so I'll draw a puddle of water next to it. I've learned that ice melting is a reversible change, so I'll show a snowflake or something that means it can turn back into ice, like an arrow going back to the ice cube. Now for the egg, I'll draw a simple oval to represent the raw egg. After that, I'll draw a fried egg next to it. I know that when an egg is cooked, it can't go back to being raw, but sometimes these ideas get mixed up in my head. Arrows might help, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to clearly show that this change can't be reversed like the ice. My picture might end up just showing both changes without clear arrows or movement.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an image with two columns. In the left column, show a square, shaded to look like an ice cube, and next to it, draw a puddle of water to indicate melted ice. Include a snowflake symbol between them to suggest reversibility, in a simple, colorful, cartoon-sketched style. In the right column, illustrate an oval to represent a raw egg, next to a simple fried egg, both depicted simply without complex arrows. Use shades of white, yellow, and light brown for the egg. The style should be basic and hand-drawn, reflecting a student's developing understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can and cannot do by illustrating the ice melting and refreezing with a snowflake, showing understanding of reversibility. However, it reflects their struggle with clearly representing the irreversibility of the cooked egg, as there's no clear dynamic sequence or arrows showcasing the change, fitting their tendency to confuse these concepts."
