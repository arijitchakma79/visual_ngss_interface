  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw an ice cube and a separate puddle of water without clearly connecting the two to show that the ice melted into water.",
    "The student might represent a change in appearance of an egg from raw to different at some stage, but without connecting this change to cooking."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show or misunderstand the concept of reversibility by omitting arrows or any indication that water can refreeze *(student doesn’t understand reversibility)*.",
    "The student may not distinguish or label changes as reversible or irreversible, or show both ice melting and egg cooking as similar processes *(student doesn’t know the concepts of reversible and irreversible)*.",
    "The student may fail to depict 'before, during, and after' stages of a change, perhaps showing only one stage, like just a cooked egg and not the raw egg and cooking process.",
    "The student cannot connect their drawings to the idea that some changes can be undone with the reverse process, while others cannot be changed back, likely due to a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts *(student lacks conceptual clarity about change reversibility)*."
