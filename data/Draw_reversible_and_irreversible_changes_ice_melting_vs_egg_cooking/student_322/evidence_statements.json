  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a change caused by heating, like an ice cube melting into water.",
    "The student can illustrate a change caused by cooling, like water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can depict a change caused by heating that is irreversible, such as a raw egg being cooked.",
    "The student can illustrate whether the changes shown are reversible or irreversible by showing the process of reversing the change or not being able to reverse it.",
    "The student can draw the characteristics of the material before, during, and after the change (e.g., showing ice as solid before and water as liquid after).",
    "The student can use their drawings to explain whether additional evidence is needed to support their claim.",
    "The student can connect their drawings to the idea that some changes can be undone with the reverse process, while others cannot be changed back."
