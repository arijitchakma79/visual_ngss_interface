  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube. That seems easy. So, I draw a square and color it light blue to look like an ice cube. Then, I’ll draw a puddle of water next to it. I know that when ice melts, it turns into water. Now, I’ll try to draw an egg. I’ll start with the egg looking raw, sort of an oval shape, plain white, and then I’ll draw a fried egg next to it. I think they have different colors. I’ll use yellow for the yolk. Cooking the egg changes it, but I’m not sure how to show that the egg can’t go back to being raw. I’m missing how I can connect the ice cube to water with something like an arrow to show the change and can’t show ice turning back, and for the egg, I’m not sure if I should explain more about how it changes. Who knows if both are reversible or not?",
  "Prompt": "Drawings of an ice cube and a separate puddle of water without connecting them. Light blue color for the ice. A separate drawing showing a raw egg and a cooked egg (fried) side by side. White and yellow for the egg. No arrows or labels to indicate changes as reversible or irreversible. Simple and childlike style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic representations of ice and water separately, and show a raw and a cooked egg, which aligns with what the student can do according to the assessment. However, it also demonstrates the student's struggle with connecting the ice cube to the water through arrows or labels to indicate reversibility, and the lack of depiction for distinct stages in the process of cooking an egg, in line with what they cannot do. The drawings are simple and childlike, fitting the description of minimal or no understanding."
