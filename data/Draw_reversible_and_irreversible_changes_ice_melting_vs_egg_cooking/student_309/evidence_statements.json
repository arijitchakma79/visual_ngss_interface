  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of ice, showing it as a solid.",
    "The student can illustrate the melting of ice, showing the transition from solid to liquid water.",
    "The student can show the reversible process by illustrating liquid water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can draw an uncooked egg in its raw state with the liquid yolk and white.",
    "The student can depict the cooked egg showing the transition to a solid state after heating.",
    "The student can demonstrate that the cooked egg cannot go back to its raw state by showing that cooling does not reverse the process.",
    "The student can label their drawings to clearly identify each stage and process.",
    "The student can use captions or annotations to explain which changes are reversible and which are not, using simple language."
