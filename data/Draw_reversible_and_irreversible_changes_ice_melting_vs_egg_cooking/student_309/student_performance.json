  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw ice in a solid form, but may not accurately depict it as a cube or in a stable form (e.g., a blob with no clear edges).",
    "The student can draw a raw egg with an oval shape to represent the egg, but may not distinguish between yolk and white clearly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate the melting process of ice transitioning to water, possibly leaving out this step entirely or failing to show change (student doesnâ€™t know how to show process).",
    "The student cannot effectively show the process of liquid water freezing back into ice (may think cooling doesn't affect water).",
    "The student may not correctly draw the cooked egg or depict it solidifying (student thinks cooking only changes color).",
    "The student does not understand that the cooking process is irreversible and may attempt to show the egg returning to a raw state (student thinks cooling does reverse process).",
    "The student is unlikely to use labels or annotations to identify each stage or explain reversibility (no use of text or arrows to show changes)."
