  "Reasoning": "I'll draw the ice first... uh, ice is kind of like a solid blob, so I'll make it a big round shape, maybe not a perfect cube. Now for the egg, they're usually oval, so I'll draw an oval shape. I'm not sure about the inside, so I'll make it one big oval without separate parts for the yolk and white. Oh, right, it needs to melt... but I don't really know how to show the ice melting into water, so maybe I'll just leave it. Now for the egg cooking... I think it just changes color, not sure how it changes shape, so I'll color it a bit different but keep it the same shape. Will it go back to raw when it cools? Maybe I'll draw another arrow back to show that. I don't know how to use text to show what's happening, so I'll just make the drawings.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a large, round shape to represent ice, which is not a clear cube. Next to it, an oval shape representing a raw egg without distinct yolk or white. There's no detail to show the ice melting or changing form. The egg shape is colored slightly differently to imply cooking but retains the same oval outline. Arrows are absent, and there's no attempt to show water or label anything. The drawing is in a simple, hand-drawn style using basic colors, suitable for a beginning level student attempt.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's abilities by showing an attempt to draw ice and a raw egg with basic shapes and color. It also reflects the limitations, such as the inability to depict processes like melting, freezing, or cooking accurately, lack of labeling or annotations to explain processes, and misunderstanding of reversibility for the egg."
