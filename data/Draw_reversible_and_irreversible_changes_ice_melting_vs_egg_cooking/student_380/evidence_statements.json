  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material's appearance before heating or cooling (e.g., draw an ice cube and a raw egg).",
    "The student can depict the material after heating (e.g., show the ice cube has turned into a puddle of water, the raw egg has turned into a cooked egg).",
    "The student can represent the reversal of heating or cooling, or the lack thereof (e.g., show the water can be frozen back into ice, but the cooked egg cannot become a raw egg again).",
    "The student can illustrate a cooling change and its potential reversal (e.g., draw how water can be frozen back into ice but a dead plant leaf does not return to a living leaf).",
    "The student can differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes through their drawings.",
    "The student can show cause and effect by linking each change to heating or cooling events."
