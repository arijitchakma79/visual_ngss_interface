  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the starting materials. I’ll sketch an ice cube, making sure it looks angular and solid. Next to it, I’ll draw a raw egg, smooth and oval-shaped, maybe with a few texture lines to show it's a shell. Now, I'll show what happens after heating: I’ll draw an arrow from the ice cube pointing to a puddle of water, labeling it something like 'heated' or 'melted'. The water will look like a small, reflective pool. For the egg, I’ll draw another arrow leading to a cooked egg, labeling it 'cooked'. The cooked egg will look more solid and have texture like a scrambled egg. For the reversible change, I’ll show the water turning back to ice with a small arrow going back in the opposite direction, labeling it 'frozen'. I remember that these changes are different, so I'll label the melting and freezing parts as 'reversible' and the cooking part as 'irreversible'. I want to use arrows and labels clearly, but sometimes I align them slightly off. Coloring will help: the ice cube should be icy blue, the water somewhat transparent, maybe light blue, and the egg will be white and yellow when cooked. The final touch will be making the labels easy to read. Hopefully, I don't forget to label each state of matter correctly like 'solid', 'liquid', but even if I do, it won’t affect understanding too much.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed diagram showing the process of reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, draw a solid, angular ice cube in icy blue, next to a smooth, oval raw egg with a textured shell. Use arrows to show the transition: from the ice cube to a reflective puddle of water in light blue, and from the raw egg to a solid, textured cooked egg in white and yellow. Include reverse arrows from the puddle back to the ice cube labeled 'reversible', and label the cooked egg change as 'irreversible'. Add clear, slightly misaligned arrows and readable labels, 'solid', 'liquid', 'heated', 'melted', 'frozen', 'cooked'. Use a realistic drawing style with accurate colors to reflect an advanced level of understanding, even with minor placement errors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately illustrate initial materials (ice cube and raw egg) and the changes they undergo while heating and cooling. Arrows and labels show cause and effect, highlighting reversible (ice cube to water) and irreversible (raw egg to cooked egg) processes. The color choices help distinguish states and emphasize understanding. Minor placement errors or occasional omissions, such as misaligned arrows or state labels, reflect the student's potential oversights without undermining their overall comprehension and detail at an advanced level."
