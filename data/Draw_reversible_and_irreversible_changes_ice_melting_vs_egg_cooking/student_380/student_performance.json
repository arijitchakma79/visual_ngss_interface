  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately illustrate the material's appearance before heating or cooling, showing an ice cube and a raw egg in their initial states.",
    "The student can correctly depict the changes after heating, such as an ice cube turning into a puddle of water and a raw egg becoming a cooked egg, with clear and accurate drawings.",
    "The student can represent the reversal of heating or cooling, showing water being frozen back into ice, with evidence of understanding that this is a reversible change.",
    "The student can clearly differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes through their drawings, using labels or annotations to indicate which changes are irreversible.",
    "The student can effectively show cause and effect by linking each change to heating or cooling events, possibly using arrows or captions to demonstrate understanding."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor details, such as labeling the states of matter, but these omissions do not significantly impact understanding. *(Occasional oversight)*",
    "The student might slightly misplace or not perfectly align arrows or annotations indicating cause and effect, but overall, the conceptual understanding remains correct. *(Minor placement errors)*"
