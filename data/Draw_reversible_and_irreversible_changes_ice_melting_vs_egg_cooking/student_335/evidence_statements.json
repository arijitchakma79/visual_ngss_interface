  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling (e.g., an ice cube and a raw egg).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated (e.g., ice becomes water and egg becomes solid).",
    "The student can show if and how the material changes again when it is cooled (e.g., water becomes ice again, but a cooked egg does not change back to a raw egg).",
    "The student can include images that demonstrate reversible changes by showing the original and final states after heating then cooling (e.g., ice-water-ice).",
    "The student can include images that demonstrate irreversible changes by showing that the material cannot return to the original state after heating and cooling (e.g., raw egg to cooked egg remains solid).",
    "The student can identify and label cause and effect patterns in their drawings to show what happens and why (e.g., heating causes melting, cooling water causes freezing)."
