  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw an ice cube and a raw egg to show the materials before any changes occur.",
    "The student can illustrate ice changing to water through simple drawings.",
    "The student may attempt to show the solidification of an egg, but it might lack detail or clarity."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly represent water changing back into ice; the drawing might be incomplete or lack clarity of the reversal process *(student unsure about reversal steps)*.",
    "The student may not effectively depict that a cooked egg cannot revert back to a raw egg *(misunderstanding of irreversible change)*.",
    "The student might struggle to accurately label or identify the cause and effect patterns, such as how heating and cooling result in changes *(labels may be missing or incorrect)*."
