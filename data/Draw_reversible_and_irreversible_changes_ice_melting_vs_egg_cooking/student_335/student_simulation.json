  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing an ice cube because I know it's one of the materials before any change happens. I remember how an ice cube looks, a simple cube, so I'll draw that. Next, I'll draw a raw egg; it's kind of egg-shaped, but I might make it look more like a circle. Now for the changes, I need to show the ice melting into water. I can draw the ice cube again and then draw some wavy lines under it to show water. For the egg, I'll try to show it cooking. Maybe I'll draw some squiggly lines around the egg to show it's cooked. But I'm not sure how to show that it canâ€™t change back, and I might forget to label things like heating or cooling, because I know I mix those up sometimes. It's tricky understanding that the egg can't go back to being raw. The ice part might not quite go back to solid, as I'm not sure what that should look like.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing showing a cube-shaped ice cube with a puddle of wavy blue water next to it. Next to them is a roughly circular raw egg on one side and the same egg with squiggly heat lines around it to indicate it's cooked. The drawing is colorful but lacks detailed labels and the cooked egg might not be clearly distinct from the raw egg.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt includes a basic depiction of an ice cube, water, and an egg, which fits the student's emerging understanding. It avoids clear labeling and detailing due to the student's tendency to miss these elements. The reversibility of ice is undershot, aligning with the student's struggle to show the ice becoming solid again, and the irreversible change of the egg is poorly clarified as the student misunderstands these concepts."
