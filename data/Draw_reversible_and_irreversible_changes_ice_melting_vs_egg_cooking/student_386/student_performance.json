  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the ice in its original state as a solid before any heating occurs.",
    "The student can illustrate the melting process, showing ice turning into water and label it as a reversible change.",
    "The student can draw the egg in its original raw state and clearly illustrate the egg becoming solid when heated, labeling it as an irreversible change.",
    "The student can depict the process of water freezing back into ice upon cooling.",
    "The student can include all stages of ice melting and refreezing, emphasizing the reversible nature through labeled sequences.",
    "The student can compare the outcomes of the reversible process of ice and water with the irreversible process of cooking an egg, visually highlighting differences clearly and accurately.",
    "The student can represent cause and effect in the drawings through observable patterns, such as using arrows to indicate change over time."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor details such as labeling small sections of the drawing, though the overall representation remains complete.",
    "The student might inconsistently apply symbols for heat or cooling (e.g., may forget to draw an arrow or temperature symbol in one instance) but otherwise conveys understanding."
