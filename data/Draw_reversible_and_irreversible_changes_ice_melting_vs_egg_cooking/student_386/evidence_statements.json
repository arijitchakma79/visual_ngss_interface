  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating, indicating the changes observed (e.g., ice turning to water, egg becoming solid).",
    "The student can depict whether the change after heating can be reversed by drawing the material after an attempt to cool or heat it back to its original state (e.g., water turning back to ice, noting that egg does not become raw again).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, showing any changes that have occurred (e.g., water turning to ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change after cooling can be reversed by drawing the material after it becomes warm again (e.g., ice turning to water again).",
    "The student can visually compare reversible changes (like ice melting and refreezing) with irreversible changes (like cooking an egg) to highlight the different outcomes.",
    "The student can represent the cause and effect of heating or cooling on materials through observable patterns in the drawings."
