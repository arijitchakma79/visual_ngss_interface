  "Reasoning": "I need to start by drawing the ice cube in its solid state before it melts. I'll use a light blue color to make it look cold and solid. I remember ice melting is a reversible process, so I'll draw an arrow from the ice cube to a puddle of water to show the change. I'll label this part 'ice melting,' and I'll write 'reversible change' next to it because the water can freeze back into ice. Now, I need to show the water freezing back into ice. I'll use another arrow pointing from the water puddle back to a newly drawn ice cube, again labeling it 'freezing' and 'reversible change.' For the egg, I'll start with drawing a raw egg in a frying pan with a yellow yolk to make it look real. I'll draw an arrow from the raw egg to a cooked egg and label this process 'egg cooking,' and I'll write 'irreversible change' because it can't go back to being raw. Oops, I almost forgot to add a symbol for heat in one of the drawings. I'll draw a wavy red arrow over the pan and next to the ice to show heat being applied during the processes. This is a bit inconsistent, but I think it shows what I mean. Iâ€™ll clearly draw and label all these stages so the differences are clear. Comparing the ice and egg changes should show how one can go back and the other can't.",
  "Prompt": "A science drawing showing reversible and irreversible changes. On the left, depict a light blue ice cube turning into a puddle of water with a blue arrow between them, labeled 'ice melting' and 'reversible change.' Show the water turning back into an ice cube with another arrow, labeled 'freezing.' On the right, draw a raw egg with a yellow yolk in a frying pan, with a red wavy arrow above it indicating heat, turning into a cooked egg labeled 'egg cooking' and 'irreversible change.' Use clear labels for all stages, and arrows to indicate changes, in a neat and organized style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw distinct stages of each process and effectively label them to show understanding of reversible and irreversible changes. Although occasionally, the student might forget minor details like symbolizing heat consistently, the overall representation effectively communicates the concepts. The use of color and symbols highlights the necessary elements, matching the level 4 description by being both clear and mostly complete."
