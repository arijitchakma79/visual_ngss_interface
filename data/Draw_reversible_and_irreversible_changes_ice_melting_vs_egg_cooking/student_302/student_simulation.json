  "Reasoning": "Hmm, I need to draw how ice melting is different from an egg cooking. Let me start by drawing a piece of ice. I'll make a simple shape, like a square or a rectangle. Okay, that looks like a block of ice, kind of. Now for the egg, I'll just draw an oval shape to be the raw egg. I know I need to show that heat is supposed to do something to them. I've seen pictures before, so I'll put a sun near the ice to show that it's getting warm. It should melt, but I'm not sure how to show that well, so I'll just leave it like that. For the egg, I remember seeing a stove or a fire, so I'll draw something like that near the egg to show it's cooking. I guess they look different, but I'm not sure how to draw the ice turning into water or the egg becoming solid. I'll just leave them as they are and hope it's understandable. I also donâ€™t really know how to show that the ice can turn back to water but the cooked egg can't go back to being raw. Reversibility is tricky!",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing on white paper displaying two scenarios side by side: On the left, a light blue rectangular block representing ice with a sun drawn above it in yellow; the ice is not visibly melting but looks intact. On the right, a white oval shape representing an egg with a red-brown circle below it to suggest a heating source, like a stove loop or fire, but without clear effects of cooking. The style is childlike, with basic shapes and limited detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's attempt, capturing minimal or inaccurate depictions of reversible and irreversible changes. They can draw basic representations of ice and a raw egg, suggest heating with a sun or stove, but fail to adequately show the transitions from ice to water or egg to cooked form. The image neither effectively demonstrates melting or cooking effects nor conveys an understanding of reversibility versus irreversibility, which is consistent with the student's limitations."
