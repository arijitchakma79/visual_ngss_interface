{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "- The student can illustrate the characteristics of a material before it is heated or cooled, such as ice and a raw egg.",
    "- The student can show what happens to the material during heating, like ice melting into water and an egg cooking to become solid.",
    "- The student can depict the characteristics of the material after heating or cooling.",
    "- The student can demonstrate which changes are reversible and which are not by drawing both a reversible change (like water freezing back into ice) and an irreversible change (like a cooked egg that cannot return to a raw state).",
    "- The student can represent their understanding of how events (like heating or cooling) cause observable changes in materials.",
    "- The student can provide clear visual evidence in their drawing to support their claim about which changes are reversible and which are irreversible."
