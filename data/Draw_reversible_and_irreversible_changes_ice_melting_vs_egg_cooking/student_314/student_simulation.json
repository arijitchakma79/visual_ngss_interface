  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw something that looks like ice first. I think ice is like a big cube, so I’ll draw a squarish shape. Maybe it should be blue or white since ice is cold. Next, I need to draw an egg. Eggs are shaped kind of like ovals, so I’ll do an oval shape. I’m not sure how to show that they change, but I could try drawing a sun next to the ice, as I think heat from the sun can melt ice. I’ll add a circle which is the sun and make it yellow. For the egg, I think they get cooked on a stove, so I’ll try drawing a simple line for the stove. I don't really know how to show the changes happening or how they’re different when heated. I remember hearing that sun melts ice, and cooking makes eggs different, but maybe it's like the ice when the egg heats up? I can't really say for sure, and I don’t know what to label these things to explain the changes, but I’ll write 'ice' and 'egg' near the shapes. I won’t write 'melting' or 'cooking' because I don’t really understand how those words fit here, so I’ll just leave it unlabeled.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing featuring a simple blue square representing ice, and an oval shape that looks like an egg. To the left of the square is a large yellow circle for the sun to indicate warmth. Next to the oval is a simple gray line suggesting a stove, but not clearly connected to the egg. There are no labels for processes like 'melting' or 'cooking', just the words 'ice' and 'egg' next to the respective shapes. The style is playful, with bright, basic colors and minimal detail or differentiation between the items.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by including basic shapes for ice and an egg, and attempts to incorporate a heat source like the sun or a stove. These elements reflect minimal understanding and provide basic representations of the materials involved. The lack of transformation and labeling in the drawing corresponds to what the student cannot do, such as showing clear state changes or depicting reversibility and irreversibility, reflecting the student's inability to accurately convey these scientific concepts."
