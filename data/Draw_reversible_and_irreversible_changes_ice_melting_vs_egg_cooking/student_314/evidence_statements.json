  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the before and after states of ice, showing it as solid before heating and as liquid water after heating.",
    "The student can illustrate how the water can be cooled to become ice again, demonstrating a reversible change.",
    "The student can depict the before and after states of an egg, showing it in a liquid state before heating and as a solid after cooking.",
    "The student can show how the cooked egg remains solid after cooling, demonstrating an irreversible change.",
    "The student can visually compare the changes in ice and egg to emphasize that some changes can be undone while others cannot.",
    "The student can label their drawings to describe the changes occurring (e.g., 'melting', 'freezing', 'cooking').",
    "The student can illustrate evidence of cause and effect by showing how applying heat (cause) leads to observable changes (effect) in both scenarios."
