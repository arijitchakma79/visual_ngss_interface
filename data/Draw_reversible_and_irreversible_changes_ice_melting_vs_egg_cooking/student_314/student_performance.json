  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can show a basic shape that might represent ice and another that might represent the egg (but without clear differentiation or details).",
    "The student may attempt to include a heat source, like a sun or stove, though without clear connection to changes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot clearly depict the solid-to-liquid transformation of ice or the liquid-to-solid transformation of the egg (student might not understand phase changes).",
    "The student cannot accurately or clearly illustrate reversibility by showing how water can be frozen back into ice (student might think once ice becomes water, it stays that way).",
    "The student cannot effectively represent the concept of irreversibility where a cooked egg remains solid after cooling (student might confuse the state change with eggs melting).",
    "The student cannot visually compare reversible and irreversible changes (student does not understand or show the difference in changes).",
    "The student cannot appropriately label drawings to describe changes, like 'melting' or 'freezing' (student might label inaccurately or omit labels entirely).",
    "The student cannot illustrate cause-and-effect relationships showing heat leading to state change (student might not connect heating with changes in state)."
