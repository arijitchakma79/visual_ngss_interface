  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ice cube and a whole, raw egg. For the ice, I'll draw it melting into a puddle of water and label it as 'reversible,' because I know that's a change we can reverse. Then, I need to show that if we freeze the water again, it'll turn back into ice, so I'll draw arrows between the two stages with labels for heating and cooling. For the egg, I'll draw it transforming into a cooked egg. I remember this change is irreversible, but sometimes I forget to label it, so I’ll put a label 'irreversible' on it. I know it can't turn back into a raw egg, but I might not always clearly show this. I should also avoid trying to make the cooked egg look like it can go back to being raw since that's wrong. I’ll make sure each part of my drawing is neat and try to use colors like blue for water and ice and something else for the egg.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing on the left: a blue ice cube turning into a puddle of water with arrows labeled 'reversible' indicating melting and refreezing. On the right: a raw egg changing into a cooked egg with arrows and labeled 'irreversible.' The drawing should use bright colors, and the style should be simple and clear to show the processes. The cooked egg should be less clearly marked, illustrating occasional oversight.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the student's ability to portray the reversible process of ice turning to water and back to ice, demonstrating proficiency with this concept. It also includes the student's effort to show the egg cooking process as irreversible, even though there might be minor lapses in labeling or clarity, aligning with the student's inability to consistently depict the irreversible nature of cooking. The use of color and arrows emphasizes the processes and aligns with the student's level of proficiency."
