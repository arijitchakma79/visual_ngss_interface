  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw the original state of both the ice and the egg before heating, showing an ice cube and a raw egg.",
    "Illustrate the process of ice melting into water and label it as 'reversible.'",
    "Illustrate the process of an egg becoming solid when heated and label it as 'irreversible.'",
    "Show the concept of ice turning back into a solid when cooled, indicating a reversible change.",
    "Include some reasoning in their drawings by using arrows or labels to show that heating and cooling can reverse changes in some materials, like the ice-water cycle."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently depict the irreversible nature of egg cooking with complete accuracy. (May occasionally forget to label it correctly or not clearly show why it can't go back to a raw egg.)",
    "Illustrate cooling changes beyond ice with full consistency, such as returning the egg to its raw state or showing non-existent reversible changes like a leaf returning from a dead state. (Student might include misconceptions or partial understanding in their drawings.)"
