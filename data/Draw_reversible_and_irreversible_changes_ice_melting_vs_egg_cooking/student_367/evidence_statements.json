  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating and cooling to show its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating, such as ice turning into water or an egg becoming solid.",
    "The student can represent if the change after heating is reversible or irreversible, like showing water becoming ice again, or a cooked egg staying solid.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens after cooling, showing examples like water becoming ice or a plant leaf dying.",
    "The student can depict whether the cooling change is reversible, such as ice turning back to water, or irreversible, like a dead leaf not returning to normal.",
    "The student can use reasoning in their drawing to show some changes are reversible by adding or removing heat (e.g., ice and water cycle).",
    "The student can illustrate that some changes cannot be undone, even with cooling or heating, like how a cooked egg can't be turned back into a raw egg."
