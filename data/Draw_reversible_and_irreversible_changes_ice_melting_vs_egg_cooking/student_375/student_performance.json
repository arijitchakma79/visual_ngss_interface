  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate what ice looks like before and after it melts, accurately showing it turns to water (reversible change).",
    "The student can illustrate what a raw egg looks like before cooking and what it looks like after, indicating a solid state (irreversible change).",
    "The student can include labels or captions explaining that the change in ice is reversible and the change in an egg is irreversible, though some labels may lack detail.",
    "The student can demonstrate the steps of heating or cooling with arrows or additional symbols, mostly correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully illustrate the freezing process of water back into ice with complete detail (may show water but not clearly as frozen solid again).",
    "The student might inconsistently compare the changes in ice and eggs, potentially not emphasizing differences as clearly as possible.",
    "Occasional minor gaps in labeling may occur, such as missing the term 'solid' or 'liquid' in some parts of the drawing (student doesn't always label phase states)."
