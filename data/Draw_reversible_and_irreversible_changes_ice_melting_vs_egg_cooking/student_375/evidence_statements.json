  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate what ice looks like before and after it melts, showing it turns to water (reversible change).",
    "The student can illustrate what water looks like after it has frozen back into ice (reversible change).",
    "The student can illustrate what a raw egg looks like before cooking and what it looks like after, showing it turns solid (irreversible change).",
    "The student can include labels or captions explaining if the change observed in each part of their drawing is reversible or irreversible.",
    "The student can use drawings to compare the changes in ice and eggs, highlighting that some changes can be reversed and some cannot.",
    "The student can show the sequence of steps, like heating or cooling, leading to the change in each drawing."
