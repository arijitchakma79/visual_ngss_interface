  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice on one side of the paper with some snowflakes or small lines to indicate it's cold and solid. Next, I'll draw the same piece of ice now melted into a puddle of water, with some drops around it to show it's liquid now. I'll make arrows pointing between the ice and the water to show the change with a small label that says 'melting (reversible)'. For the egg, I'll draw a raw egg in its shell, then another one next to it but cracked open with the yolk and white clearly visible. On the other side, I'll draw an egg being cooked, maybe in a pan, with the yolk and white solidified. I'll add arrows between the raw and cooked egg, labeling them 'cooking (irreversible)'. I won't focus too much on showing the freezing process since I'm not very confident about that part, and I might forget to label 'solid' next to the ice. For color, the ice will be light blue and the water colorless. The raw egg will have an off-white shell, with yellow and white for the yolk and egg white. The cooked egg will look more solid with shades of white and yellow.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing reversible and irreversible changes: On the left, a light blue ice block with snowflake symbols and an arrow labeled 'melting (reversible)' pointing to a nearby colorless water puddle with droplets. On the right, an off-white raw egg with visible yolk and white, and an arrow labeled 'cooking (irreversible)' pointing to an egg being cooked in a pan, yolk, and white are solid in shades of yellow and white. The overall style is simple and a bit colorful, resembling a school project with clear labels, arrows, and some omitted details like 'solid' and 'liquid' labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate the reversible change of ice melting into water and the irreversible change of an egg being cooked. Arrows and labels are used correctly for indicating processes, but there's a lack of detail in freezing water back to ice and some missing phases labels, reflecting the student's intermediate level and their described limitations."
