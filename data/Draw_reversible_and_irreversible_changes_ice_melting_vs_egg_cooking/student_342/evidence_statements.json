  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate the change when the material is heated (e.g., ice melting into water, an egg solidifying during cooking).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens when the material is cooled (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can differentiate between reversible changes (ice melting and refreezing) and irreversible changes (cooked egg not returning to a raw state) using drawings.",
    "The student can show through drawings how heating and cooling can sometimes reverse each otherâ€™s effects and sometimes cannot."
