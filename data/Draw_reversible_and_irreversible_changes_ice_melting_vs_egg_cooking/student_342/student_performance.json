  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a piece of ice in its solid form before any change.",
    "The student can illustrate ice melting into water, capturing the transition from solid to liquid.",
    "The student might show an egg drawn whole, then changes color slightly to signify cooking."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not illustrate water freezing back into ice clearly *(student might not know that the process can be reversed)*.",
    "The student may not clearly differentiate between the reversible nature of ice melting/refreezing and the irreversible nature of egg cooking *(might show egg cooking as reversible)*.",
    "The student could fail to show the complete process of an egg solidifying during cooking visibly *(image not detailed enough to capture changes)*."
