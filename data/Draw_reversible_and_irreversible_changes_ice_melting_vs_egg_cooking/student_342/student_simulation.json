  "Reasoning": "Alright, I'm working on drawing the changes in ice and eggs. First, I'll draw a simple cube shape to represent a piece of ice – that's pretty straightforward. I remember that the ice melts, so I'll draw some wavy lines below the ice block to show it turning into water. This feels like it's getting from solid to liquid. Now the tricky part, drawing an egg. Let me draw an egg that's just an oval to represent it being whole. I'll add some lines to show it's starting to cook, maybe changing color a bit in the middle. All done, but I'm not sure how to show the water freezing back into ice... and the egg, umm… it looks like it can turn back, but I think it's meant to be cooked now.",
  "Prompt": "A simple hand-drawn style image on a white background. On the left, there is a blue ice cube with wavy lines drawn beneath it to represent melting ice turning to water. On the right, there's a large oval shape as a whole egg, with some shading in the middle to hint at cooking. The drawing is clean and uses minimal colors: blue for ice and water, white and light yellow for the egg. The style is basic, with visible lines showing effort in capturing transition but lacks detail on reversibility.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately portrays the student's abilities and limitations. The student is able to show the melting of ice into water, indicating their understanding of the reversible process to some extent. However, they struggle with illustrating the egg cooking process fully and showing the visibility of its irreversible nature. The image captures the egg's incomplete transition detail (slight color change), reflecting the student's developing understanding. Additionally, the prompt does not emphasize water refreezing, aligning with the student's difficulty in showing reversibility of the melting process."
