  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw an object resembling an ice cube and an egg before any changes take place, though with minimal detail (e.g., simple square for ice, oval for egg)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes, possibly drawing both as either melting or cooking without distinction (e.g., both ice and egg turn into a puddle or are simply shown as altered without any reversal shown).",
    "The student cannot accurately depict changes after heating or cooling, possibly showing the egg as returned to its original state after cooking or ice permanently changed into a liquid with no reversal (e.g., egg drawn as uncooked after cooking).",
    "The student may not successfully demonstrate the cause and effect relationship between heat application and the change in state (e.g., drawing random arrows or none at all to indicate changes)."
