  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw changes that happen to an ice cube and an egg. First, I'll start with the ice cube. I remember it's supposed to look like a square, so I'll just draw a simple square. Then, I'll draw an egg, which is kind of like an oval shape, so I'll just make an oval. Now, I have to think about what happens when I change them. When I hear 'ice melting', I think about water, but I'm not sure how to show it changes back. I'll just make it look like water, with some squiggly lines coming down from the square. For the egg, when I hear 'cooking', I think it changes form. Maybe I should draw it in a kind of messy way that just shows something different. I guess I'll squish the oval a bit and scribble over it. I heard that changes happen with heating, but I don't really know how to show that. I'll just add some random arrows here and there. Hopefully, that's okay.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like sketch of a science experiment showing reversible and irreversible changes. In the drawing, show a plain blue square to represent an ice cube and a white oval for an egg. Next to the ice cube, depict a simple puddle with blue wavy lines drawn below it, suggesting melting. Next to the egg, draw a scribbled mess over a distorted oval to suggest change. Add random, unevenly drawn arrows around both the ice cube and egg, with no clear indication of cause and effect. Use basic colors like blue for water and gray for arrows. The style should be very simple, as if drawn by a child with little understanding of the concepts.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to create basic shapes for an ice cube and an egg, showing initial states but failing to accurately depict the reversible and irreversible changes. The melting of ice is presented as a puddle without showing reversal, and the egg is mishandled to indicate a change with no clear depiction of cooking or permanence. Arrows indicating change lack clarity, aligning with the student's misunderstanding of cause and effect."
