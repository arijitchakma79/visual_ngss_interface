  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can demonstrate the initial characteristics of materials before any heating or cooling takes place.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes in the material after heating, showing which aspects of the material have changed.",
    "The student can depict whether the changes caused by heating are reversible or irreversible (e.g., water freezing back into ice or a cooked egg remaining a solid).",
    "The student can show the characteristics of materials after they have been cooled and the changes that occurred.",
    "The student can determine and draw whether the changes from cooling can be reversed or are irreversible (e.g., ice turning back to water versus a dead plant leaf not coming back to life).",
    "The student can use their drawings to support the claim that some changes due to heating or cooling can be reversed, while others cannot be reversed.",
    "The student can identify patterns in their drawings that show the cause and effect relationship between heating/cooling and the changes in materials."
