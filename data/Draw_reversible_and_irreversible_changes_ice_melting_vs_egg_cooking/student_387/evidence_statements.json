  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of ice before and after it melts.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of water frozen back into ice.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of a raw egg before and after it is cooked.",
    "The student can show that a cooked egg remains solid and cannot return to its raw state.",
    "The student can use drawings to represent which changes are reversible (e.g., ice to water and back to ice) and which are irreversible (e.g., cooking an egg).",
    "The student can demonstrate cause and effect through drawings by showing that heating or cooling causes changes in materials.",
    "The student can include illustrations that describe the observable patterns when materials are heated or cooled and whether those changes can be reversed.",
    "The student can communicate reasoning using drawings, showing some changes can be undone by reversing the process and some cannot."
