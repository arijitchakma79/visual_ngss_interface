  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate ice before melting and after melting into water, clearly showing the phase change.",
    "Illustrate water freezing back into ice, accurately representing the reversible change.",
    "Illustrate a raw egg before cooking and a cooked egg, highlighting the irreversible transformation.",
    "Show that a cooked egg remains solid and cannot return to its raw state, using effective visual cues.",
    "Use drawings to indicate which changes are reversible (ice to water and back) and which are irreversible (egg cooking), with clear differentiation.",
    "Demonstrate cause and effect through drawings by accurately showing that heating or cooling causes changes in materials.",
    "Include illustrations that describe observable patterns when materials are heated or cooled, indicating which changes are reversible.",
    "Communicate reasoning using drawings, effectively showing some changes can be undone while others cannot."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Minor gaps may exist in labeling, such as occasional missing labels for temperatures at which phase changes occur.",
    "Illustrations might partially overlook environmental context such as air temperature or presence of heat source (room for minor enhancement)."
