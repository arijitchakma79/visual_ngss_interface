  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a block of ice, making sure it's blue and square with some shiny spots to indicate its frozen state. Then I’ll draw a small arrow pointing to a puddle of water next to it, colored in light blue, to show the ice has melted. For the reversible change, I'll draw another arrow going back from the water to the ice and add a snowflake symbol to show it's freezing again. For the egg, I’ll depict a whole raw egg first and then, next to it, a frying pan with a cooked egg, showing it as way more solid and white with a hint of yellow yolk. I need to make sure arrows point from the raw egg to the cooked egg, but I'll leave out another arrow going back since the egg cannot be undone. I'll include a little indication like a small flame under the frying pan for heat. I recall there might be something missing like air temperature, but I'll focus on showing how heating and cooling changes the states. I'll add small labels like 'reversible' and 'irreversible' with each process. I'm trying to communicate the main changes accurately, even if some details about environment might not be emphasized.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a science illustration showing reversible and irreversible changes. Start with a blue ice block, with an arrow turning into a light blue puddle, and another arrow back to the ice with a snowflake. Next, draw a whole egg next to a frying pan with a white and yellow cooked egg, having an arrow only one-way from raw to cooked. Add small flames under the pan for heat indication. Label 'reversible' near the ice-water transition and 'irreversible' near the egg transformation. Use simple colors and a clear, basic drawing style with some missing detailed labeling for environment.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by focusing on accurate portrayal of state changes for ice and egg transformation within a reversible and irreversible context. It emphasizes simple illustrations and clear distinctions between reversible and irreversible processes, while acknowledging some neglect of detailed environmental factors, such as exact temperature labeling, consistent with the student's minor limitations as described."
