  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the ice melting since I know that's a reversible change. I'll sketch a simple piece of ice, which is a solid, maybe with some light blue shading to represent its coldness. Next, I’ll draw an arrow pointing to the right to show the change when the ice melts into water; I'll depict the water as a puddle with ripples, shaded in a darker blue. To indicate the process being reversible, I'll add a second arrow pointing back to the left labeled 'refreeze'. For the egg cooking, first I'll draw a raw egg in its shell, then use an arrow to show it being cracked open into a frying pan. I'll sketch a cooked egg, emphasizing its solid white and yellow colors. I realize I need to show this change is irreversible, so no arrow back. I remember sometimes I forget to label arrows, so I'll check to ensure they're all there this time.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two processes side-by-side. On the left, draw a sequence of ice melting: a light blue ice cube on the left, an arrow pointing right labeled 'melting', leading to a dark blue puddle, and another arrow curving back to the left, labeled 'refreezing', pointing back to another ice cube. On the right, draw an egg cooking: start with a raw egg with a white shell, an arrow labeled 'crack', pointing to a frying pan with a cooked egg, emphasizing the solid white and yellow parts. Use realistic colors and a clear, sleek drawing style with labeled arrows distinguishing the reversible and irreversible processes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all elements I am confident in: showing the changes with clear illustrations and labels. It highlights reversible and irreversible changes, aligns with my understanding of how each process works, and indicates cause and effect patterns. The choice of colors and realistic style reflects the effort expected at my level, while allowing room for occasional lapses, like possibly not distinguishing physical and chemical changes with text."
