  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture showing the changes of ice melting and refreezing.",
    "The student can draw a picture showing the changes of an egg being cooked.",
    "The student can include the characteristics of materials before the change (ice as solid, egg as raw).",
    "The student can include the characteristics of materials after the change (ice as liquid water, egg as cooked).",
    "The student can illustrate if the change can be reversed or not (water can freeze back into ice, cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can show with drawings that cooling water can make it ice again but cooling a cooked egg does not make it raw.",
    "The student can demonstrate the cause and effect through observable patterns in their drawings."
