  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the change of ice melting into water and then refreezing back into ice.",
    "The student can illustrate the cooking of an egg with clear before (raw) and after (cooked) states.",
    "The student can include distinct characteristics of materials before the change (ice as solid, egg as raw) in their drawings.",
    "The student can portray the characteristics of materials after the change (ice as liquid water, egg as cooked).",
    "The student can correctly illustrate that ice melting is a reversible change (with arrows depicting freezing), while egg cooking is irreversible.",
    "The student can show with drawings that cooling water turns it back into ice, but cooling a cooked egg does not revert it to raw.",
    "The student can effectively demonstrate cause and effect with observable patterns, showing clear understanding in their drawings."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally omit minor labels or arrows that indicate state changes (e.g., forgets an arrow indicating refreezing one time).",
    "The student may not always clearly differentiate between the processes, like not emphasizing the difference between physical and chemical changes in textual notes (but correctly shows it visually)."
