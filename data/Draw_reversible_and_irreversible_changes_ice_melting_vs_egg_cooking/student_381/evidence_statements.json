  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice before being heated and describe its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to ice when it is heated, showing it turning into water.",
    "The student can depict how water can be cooled to return to ice and describe the reversible process.",
    "The student can draw a raw egg before cooking and describe its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to an egg when it is cooked, showing it turning solid.",
    "The student can explain through drawings that cooking an egg is an irreversible process and doesn't turn back to a raw egg when cooled.",
    "The student can identify the causes that lead to the observable changes in both reversible and irreversible examples.",
    "The student can use evidence in their drawings to support claims about the reversibility or irreversibility of changes."
