  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start with drawing a piece of ice. I remember that ice is cold and solid, so I'll make sure to show it as a clear, blue ice cube with solid edges. Next, I'll illustrate the melting process by drawing the ice becoming water, adding droplets and a small puddle to show water on the floor. After that, I'll show how water can turn back to ice. I need to remember to use an arrow to indicate the cooling process, even though I sometimes forget to label this step. Now, moving on to the egg. I'll draw a raw egg, highlighting its liquid state inside and fragile shell. For the cooked egg, I'll illustrate it with a solid white and yellow texture, emphasizing the change in color and texture. I know that cooking an egg is irreversible, so I'll use arrows to show heat being applied, maybe with some squiggles to suggest the heat effect, and I'll explain that the egg doesn't turn back to a liquid state after cooking. I need to be careful to not just say it 'gets hot'; maybe I can use the word 'denature' instead.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed science illustration showing two processes: On one side, a clear blue ice cube transforming into water, including droplets and a small puddle, with a reverse transformation into an ice cube using labeled arrows showing heat application and cooling. On the other side, a raw egg with visible liquid inside and a fragile shell, transforming into a solid cooked egg with clear white and yellow colors, using arrows and labels to indicate heat application and demonstrating irreversibility. The drawing is colorful and labeled, with some minor labels potentially missing. The overall style is educational and illustrative, suitable for a science task performance.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by capturing the detailed process of both reversible and irreversible changes, with labeled transformations and clear coloring to indicate states. It acknowledges areas of struggle, such as possibly missing labels during the cooling step and occasionally simplifying explanations, ensuring a realistic representation of the student's work."
