  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a detailed picture of ice before being heated and accurately describe its characteristics, such as being cold and solid.",
    "The student can illustrate the melting process of ice accurately, showing it turning into water and may even include details like droplets and puddles.",
    "The student can depict how water can be cooled to return to ice, clearly explaining the reversible nature of the process.",
    "The student can draw a raw egg before cooking and describe its characteristics, like its liquid state and fragility.",
    "The student can clearly illustrate what happens to an egg when it is cooked, showing it turning solid and differentiated in color and texture.",
    "The student can convincingly explain through drawings that cooking an egg is an irreversible process, indicating that it does not return to a raw state when cooled.",
    "The student can accurately identify and explain the causes behind the observable changes in both reversible and irreversible examples, using arrows and labels as needed.",
    "The student can effectively use evidence in their drawings to support claims about the reversibility or irreversibility of changes, such as arrows indicating heat application or cooling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally miss labeling a minor part of the drawing (e.g., not labeling the cooling step when water returns to ice).",
    "The student could sometimes use overly simplified descriptions for complex processes (e.g., 'egg gets hot' rather than 'egg proteins denature')."
