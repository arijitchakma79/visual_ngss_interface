  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a scenario where heating causes a change in a substance, such as an egg being cooked on a stove.",
    "The student can draw an ice cube and show it turning into water, accurately representing the reversible process of melting.",
    "The student can label the egg and ice cube in their original states and capture the changes to a certain extent, such as ice becoming water.",
    "The student can use simple labels or notes to indicate 'heating' for the egg and 'melting' for the ice, showing an understanding of process causation."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently show the irreversibility of the cooked egg, perhaps not clearly indicating it cannot be uncooked. (e.g., might forget to cross out a reversal arrow)",
    "The student might misunderstand or not fully portray the reversible nature of the ice-water transition, forgetting to clearly show the water refreezing into ice.",
    "The student might lack a consistent approach to labeling or may leave some changes without descriptive notes. (e.g., may neglect to label the effect of 'heating' on the egg)"
