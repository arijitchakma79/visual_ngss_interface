  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a scenario where heating or cooling causes a change in a substance.",
    "The student can draw the original form of a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can show what the material looks like after it is heated or cooled (e.g., melted ice becomes water, a cooked egg is solid).",
    "The student can depict whether the change is reversible or irreversible by showing or writing the process of reversing the change (e.g., melted ice becoming ice again or cooked egg not reverting to raw state).",
    "The student can use simple labels or notes to explain the cause of the change (e.g., heating leads to melting).",
    "The student can provide evidence of understanding cause and effect by showing the connections between the actions (heating/cooling) and the changes observed."
