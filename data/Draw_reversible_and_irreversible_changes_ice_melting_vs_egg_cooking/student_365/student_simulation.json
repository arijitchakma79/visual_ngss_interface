  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw the changes between ice melting and an egg being cooked. I’ll start with the ice. I remember that ice turns into water when it melts, and this can be reversed. So, I’ll draw a simple blue ice cube and a little puddle of water next to it. I’ll use arrows to show the ice changing into water, but I might forget to add arrows to show water changing back into ice. Now for the egg. I know that once an egg is cooked, it can’t be uncooked. I'll draw one side of a frying pan with a whole egg and the other side with a fried egg. I need to remember to add an arrow showing heating for this one. I'm not always good at remembering to cross out the arrow showing the egg can't go back to a raw state, so I better try. For labels, I'll write 'ice' and 'water' next to my drawing of the melting sequence and 'egg' and 'cooked egg' for the frying sequence. I’ll also write 'melting' for the ice and 'heating' for the egg to make it clear what's happening, but sometimes I forget to do this consistently.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn style sketch depicting two scenarios. On the left, a blue ice cube is turning into a water puddle with a small arrow pointing from the ice cube to the water. The words 'ice' and 'water' are labeled on the respective parts, with 'melting' written above. On the right, there's a frying pan with an egg on one side and a cooked egg on the other, with an arrow labeled 'heating' from the raw egg to the cooked egg. The drawing uses simple colors like blue for the ice and yellow for the egg, in a child-like or amateur sketch style. There’s an attempt to cross out an arrow showing the egg can't go back to its raw state, though it may not be very clear.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate melting for the ice while being inconsistent with representing the reversible aspect by not detailing refreezing. It also shows the proficiency in illustrating the cooking process with 'heating' but potential failure to clearly mark irreversibility of the cooked egg state. Labels are included, reflecting understanding, though they might be inconsistent or incomplete, aligning with the student's proficiency level."
