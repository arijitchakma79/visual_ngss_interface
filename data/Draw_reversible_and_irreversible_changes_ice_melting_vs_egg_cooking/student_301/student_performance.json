  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Attempt to draw an ice cube or a raw egg in the initial state, though they might be simple or unclear.",
    "Draw something that perhaps resembles water or ice, but without a clear indication of transformation or relation to other states.",
    "Use some labels that may name the objects (like 'egg' or 'ice'), despite potential inaccuracies."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Accurately draw the changed state of material after it has been heated, such as a water puddle from melted ice or a properly depicted cooked egg. (student may draw incorrectly or not at all)",
    "Show the reversible process of ice melting and refreezing to the original state. (student doesn’t connect the steps or leaves it incomplete)",
    "Illustrate an irreversible change correctly, like a cooked egg depicted as remaining changed, and don’t understand that it's irreversible. (student might draw a raw egg becoming a chicken)",
    "Demonstrate cause and effect relationships clearly, like showing heating leading to melting, or cooling not reverting a cooked egg. (student’s drawing lacks causal links or pictures changes without context)"
