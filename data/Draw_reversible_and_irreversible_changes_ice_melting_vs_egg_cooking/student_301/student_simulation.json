  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw reversible and irreversible changes for ice melting and an egg cooking. First, I'll try to draw an ice cube. I think it’s usually square-ish, so I'll make a box shape and label it 'ice'. Now, for a raw egg, I'll make an oval shape and write 'egg' next to it. I remember ice can melt, but I'm not sure how to show that it turns into water, so maybe I'll just draw some wavy lines below the ice cube. I’ll label the lines 'water', even if it doesn’t look quite like water. With the egg, I know it changes when you cook it, but instead of a cooked egg, maybe I'll draw a chick coming out because eggs make chicks, right? It might be wrong, but I'll put the chick with the 'egg' label. I don’t really get how to show what heating does or how it’s different from ice melting, so I won’t connect these things clearly. I won’t try showing ice becoming ice again either.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing, with a crude square labeled 'Ice' and an oval labeled 'Egg'. Below the square, wavy lines are labeled 'Water'. There’s a small, poorly drawn chick labeled 'Chick' next to the egg. The paper has some color: the ice is light blue, the egg is white, and the chick is yellow. The labels are handwritten in a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt reflects the student's attempts to draw initial states, with an unclear depiction of transformation (like wavy lines as water) and a misinterpretation of irreversible change (like a chick from an egg). There’s a lack of showcasing processes or cause-effect relationships, which matches the student's struggles as described."
