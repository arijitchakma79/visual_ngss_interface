  "Topic": "Draw reversible and irreversible changes (ice melting vs. egg cooking)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial state of a material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice cube, raw egg).",
    "The student can draw the changed state of a material after it has been heated (e.g., water puddle from melted ice, cooked egg).",
    "The student can draw the changed state of a material after it has been cooled (e.g., frozen water back to ice, cooked egg doesnâ€™t change).",
    "The student can show through drawings that some changes are reversible by illustrating an ice cube turning to water and back to an ice cube.",
    "The student can show through drawings that some changes are irreversible by illustrating a raw egg that is cooked and cannot be turned back to a raw egg.",
    "The student can label or depict the cause and effect relationship in their drawing (e.g., heating causes the ice to melt, while cooling does not revert a cooked egg)."
