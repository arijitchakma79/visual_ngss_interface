  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two different habitats. First, I remember a forest has lots of trees, so I'll draw big green trees. I know squirrels like trees, so I'll add one climbing a tree. I'll also add a bird flying above the trees because I’ve seen that in nature shows. Now, for the second habitat, a pond would be perfect. I'll draw a pond with wavy water lines and some water plants sticking out. In the water, I'll draw a fish — a simple shape should work. I'll also draw a frog on a lily pad because frogs like water. I know I’m supposed to label these things, so I'll do my best with the names I remember. In the forest, it will be tricky to remember every animal or interaction, like what each one eats or does. Same with the pond; I don’t remember all the kinds of fish that could be there. But I know both places have lots of different animals. I’ll try to clearly label and write the names of the ones I do show.",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing of two distinct habitats, side by side. On the left, a forest with tall green trees, a squirrel on a tree, and a bird flying above. On the right, a pond with wavy blue water lines and water plants. In the pond, a fish and a frog on a lily pad are visible. Labels indicate the squirrel, bird, fish, and frog. The drawing style is simple and colorful, with visible effort typical of a proficient elementary student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's capabilities by showing two distinct habitats and a variety of living things within them, as instructed. The selected living things are correctly placed within their habitats, and labels are present, reflecting a solid but not exhaustive understanding of each ecosystem. The prompt matches the student's struggle, as it lacks an extensive range of biodiversity and doesn't delve into specific interactions or ecosystem roles, aligning with the student's proficiency level."
