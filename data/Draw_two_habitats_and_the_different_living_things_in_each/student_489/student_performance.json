  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a terrestrial habitat, such as a forest, and an aquatic habitat, such as a pond, with detailed elements unique to each environment.",
    "The student can include and accurately label at least two different types of living things in each habitat, such as trees and deer in the forest, and fish and algae in the pond.",
    "The student can clearly show patterns and highlight differences in where specific plants and animals live by comparing the two habitats, such as showing how fish are found in water and birds might be shown in both but in different contexts.",
    "The student can label and organize observations clearly to demonstrate a solid understanding of plant and animal diversity across both habitats, using terms like 'flora' and 'fauna' accurately in context."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally miss small details, like forgetting to label one of the smaller living things in one of the habitats, though it doesn't significantly impact the overall understanding.",
    "The student could mistakenly use slightly inaccurate colors or symbols for certain features if they are unfamiliar with exact species appearance, such as coloring a freshwater fish as it were a saltwater fish, but overall labels and organization remain clear."
