  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two large sections on my paper. On the left, I’ll draw a forest as my terrestrial habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I’ll draw tall, green trees with big branches. I’ll add some deer on the ground and maybe a few birds up in the trees. I know I need to label at least two living things here, so I'll label the trees as ‘flora’ and the deer as ‘fauna’. Now, on the right side, I'll draw a pond for my aquatic habitat. I should include fish, so I'll draw some fish swimming in the water. I've learned that algae is also important in ponds, so I’ll draw a green layer at the bottom and label it as ‘flora’. For the fish, I’ll label them as ‘fauna’. I want to show how birds might be in both habitats, so maybe I'll draw a bird flying above the pond. I’ll label it as ‘fauna’ too. Sometimes, I forget to label smaller things, so I need to double-check. Oh, and I’ll be careful about the colors—I don’t want to make the fish look like they're from the ocean, like with brighter colors, because we're looking at a freshwater pond.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two distinct habitats: On the left, a terrestrial forest habitat with tall green trees labeled 'flora' and a few deer labeled 'fauna'. Some birds are perched in the trees. On the right, an aquatic pond habitat with fish swimming, labeled 'fauna', and green algae at the bottom identified as 'flora'. A bird is flying above the pond, also labeled 'fauna'. Use colored pencils for realistic but vibrant colors, ensuring the fish appear suitable for a freshwater environment. Include labels for all living things and highlight the differences in species between the two habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capability to accurately depict and label both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. It highlights their ability to identify and distinguish between the flora and fauna within each environment, using terms like 'flora' and 'fauna' appropriately. It acknowledges potential struggles, such as minor labeling omissions or incorrect fish coloration, aligning with their advanced level of representation and minor challenges described in the student profile."
