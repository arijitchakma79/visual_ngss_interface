  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two big areas on my paper. I think I should make one a rectangle and the other a wavy shape. The rectangle might be for land, and the wavy one could be for water. Now for the land, I'll add some triangles because I remember trees can be pointy. I'll also draw some circles and ovals; maybe these can be some animals or plants. I'm not sure which ones belong where, so I'll put the same ones in both places. For the water area, I'll add more circles because I can't think of anything different. I feel like fish live in water, but these circles look the same as the ones on land. It's hard to make them different. I'm not sure how to show the habitats aren't the same, but I did try to make different areas.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple child-like illustration with two separate areas: one rectangular shape and one wavy shape. Fill the rectangular area with some triangle shapes resembling trees and random circles and ovals as plants or animals. In the wavy area, add more circles and ovals, showing similar shapes between both areas. Use bright, basic colors such as green for the triangles (trees) and blue for the wavy area (water). The overall style should be simple and basic, as if drawn by a young child with crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt represents a drawing with two different shapes signifying areas, but without clear identification as distinct habitats. It matches the student's capability with simple symbolic representation like triangles for trees and the same repetitive shapes for living things in both areas. The lack of logical placement of animals and plants illustrates the student's misunderstanding of habitat differentiation."
