  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two places because the task is about habitats. Hmm, one can be land and the other water maybe. For the land, I'll draw some lines that look like grass. It's just zigzag lines. Now for water, I'll draw a wavy line. That's what water looks like to me. I think these show one is land and one is water. I should add some living things now. I'll put a circle here. Maybe this is like an animal. I'll add some sticks coming out of the circle to show legs or ears, but I'm not sure what it should be called. Next, some more circles and lines can be like plants or animals. I'm just making shapes, not specific things. I think both habitats are done. I’ll add some more random shapes in both places just to fill it up. None of them has a name because I don’t know what they're exactly supposed to be. In the end, it just looks like lots of different shapes. I hope this is okay.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simplistic drawing of two habitats. On the left, have a basic land habitat with green zigzag lines for grass and several random shapes like circles and lines that resemble basic forms of plants or animals. On the right, depict a water habitat with a blue wavy line and similarly random circles and lines that vaguely hint at living things. The drawing should be in crayon style, with bright colors and without labels or specific creatures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents the student's ability to draw basic outlines of land and water habitats using wavy and zigzag lines. The drawing includes random shapes such as circles and lines that might resemble living things without specific identification. There are no specific plants or animals drawn or labeled, reflecting the student's minimal understanding as they haven't correctly illustrated distinct habitats or recognized diversity."
