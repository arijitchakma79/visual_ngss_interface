  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm supposed to draw two different habitats. The first one I'll draw is a land habitat. I remember that trees are often found in land habitats, so I'll draw a simple tree with a trunk and some green leaves. Maybe I'll add some grass around it because that's also a common land plant. For animals, I know lizards like the sun on land, so I'll draw a lizard near the tree. Now for the water habitat, I need to show some plants and animals that live there. I think some plants can grow in water, like those reed things, so I'll draw a few simple, tall aquatic plants. For an animal, I'll draw a fish because they definitely live in water. I think that's enough because I can't think of many more different plants or animals for each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two habitats: on the left, a simple land habitat with a single tree with green leaves and a patch of grass at its base, and a lizard nearby. On the right, a basic water habitat featuring a few tall, thin, simple aquatic plants and a fish swimming near them. The drawing is colorful, using green for the tree and grass, blue for the water, and basic colors for the fish and lizard. The style is simplistic and childlike, with limited details and elements in each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes a basic representation of two habitats: one land and one water. The student draws a few types of plants and animals, aligning with their ability to show some habitat elements. They include a tree and grass for the land habitat and aquatic plants for the water habitat, demonstrating their emerging understanding. The inclusion of a lizard and fish shows their attempt to depict animals for each habitat. However, the drawing lacks diversity and mixes limited elements, reflecting the student's struggle with showing a wide variety of living things and detailing distinct habitat features."
