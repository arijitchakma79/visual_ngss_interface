  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two different habitats, one land and one water, showing a few types of plants and animals in each, though not an extensive variety.",
    "The student can illustrate some specific examples of plants, such as a tree or grass for land habitats and possibly a simple aquatic plant for water habitats, though with limited detail.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show a wide variety of living things within each habitat. (student may only draw one or two types, missing diversity)",
    "The student may misunderstand the distinct plant and animal types for each habitat, possibly mixing environments (e.g., drawing a squirrel in a water habitat).",
    "The student cannot consistently show patterns of diversity and may struggle to compare the habitat types effectively. (student knows habitats are different but may not articulate how)"
