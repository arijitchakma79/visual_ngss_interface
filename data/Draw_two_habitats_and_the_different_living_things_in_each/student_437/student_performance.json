  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and draw two different habitats, one on land and one in water, but may not label them accurately (e.g., forest might just look like generic trees).",
    "The student can include at least two different types of living things for each habitat, such as simple drawings of familiar plants and animals (e.g., a tree and a bird for land, fish and seaweed for water).",
    "The student can show some recognition of differences between the two habitats by drawing visibly different elements (e.g., fish in the water and a bird on land)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to accurately describe the diversity of life between the two habitats, potentially showing the same types of plants in both environments without distinction (e.g., trees in water habitat *(student doesn't know this)*).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate how different plants and animals are suited to their specific habitats or to use patterns effectively, often portraying animals without understanding their adaptations (e.g., drawing a bear swimming with fish *(misunderstanding animal habitats)*)."
