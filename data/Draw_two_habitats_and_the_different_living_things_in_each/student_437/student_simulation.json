  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a land habitat. I know forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw some tall, green trees. I'll add a bird on a branch because they often live in trees. There might also be some animals on the ground, like a rabbit. Next, I'll draw a water habitat. I'll make it all blue to show it's underwater. I know fish live in water, so I'll sketch a couple of them swimming. I'll add some seaweed at the bottom because I've seen pictures of it. I remember that land and water habitats look different, so I'll try to show that by making the land green and the water blue. But I guess plants like trees might be in water too, so maybe I'll add those in the water as well. I know fish need water, so they can't go on land. But I think it's okay if a bear is swimming in the water with the fish because I've seen pictures of bears in rivers.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a land habitat with green trees and a small bird on a branch, plus a brown rabbit on the ground. On the right, a water habitat with a blue background, showing a couple of cartoonish fish swimming and some green seaweed at the bottom. There is also a tree partially submerged in the water, incorrectly placed. The style is colorful and simplistic, like a young child's drawing with crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic, recognizable elements of both a land and a water habitat but shows misunderstandings, such as including a tree in the water habitat. It captures elementary differentiation through color (green for land, blue for water) and the correct placement of certain animals like birds in trees and fish in water. The drawing also illustrates a common childlike mistake of putting animals in unsuitable habitats, like a bear in the water."
