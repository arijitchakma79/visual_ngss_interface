  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two different habitats. One will be land and the other one will be water. For the land habitat, Iâ€™ll draw some trees; maybe a couple of big ones and some bushes too. I'll add some animals like squirrels climbing one of the trees and maybe a bird sitting on a branch. I remember that squirrels like trees, so they fit well here. I should also draw some grass on the ground. Now for the water habitat, I'll sketch a pond. I'll draw some fish swimming in it; fish are good in water! I'll add a couple of plants that grow in water. I might draw a frog or two sticking out from the water, since they like both land and water. When it comes to labeling, I'll label some of the things like 'tree', 'squirrel', and 'fish'. But I might forget some smaller labels, or just write 'fish' instead of naming a specific type of fish, because I'm not quite sure of the names. Hopefully, these drawings make it clear which animals and plants go where, even if I don't catch every detail.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two habitats: a land habitat and a water habitat. On the left, the land habitat has trees with squirrels and birds, bushes, and grass. On the right, the water habitat shows a pond with fish, water plants, and a couple of frogs on the edge. Labels show 'tree', 'squirrel', 'bird', and 'fish' and some elements may be unlabeled. Use bright colors like greens and blues, and a simple, child-drawing style with visible crayon strokes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt mirrors what the student can and cannot do by depicting clear and distinct habitats with appropriate living things, like squirrels and trees on land, and fish in water. The drawing shows basic labeling and an understanding of ecological adaptation. However, it lacks detailed biodiversity and specific labels for fish types, matching the student's partial understanding and minor struggles in classification."
