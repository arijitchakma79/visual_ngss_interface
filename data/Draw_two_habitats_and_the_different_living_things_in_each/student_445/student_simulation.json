  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw two habitats. First, I’ll start with a land habitat. I remember that forests are a type of land habitat, so I'll draw some trees. I'll add a few animals like a deer and a bird. I think rabbits live in forests too, so I’ll put one of those in. Now for the water habitat, I can draw an ocean. I know fish live in the ocean, so I'll draw a few fish. I'll also draw a seaweed plant and maybe a turtle because I think turtles are found in the ocean. I should label some of these things. Let me label the deer, the bird, and the fish, but I'm not sure about some of the other names. I see that the deer is in one habitat and the fish is in the other, so I guess they don’t live together. But I’m not really sure about which animals belong only in one habitat or if they can live in both.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a forest habitat featuring a few green trees, a brown deer, a small gray rabbit, and a blue bird. Labels: 'Deer' and 'Bird'. On the right, an ocean habitat with some blue water. It includes a couple of colorful fish, a green seaweed plant, and a turtle. Labels: 'Fish'. The drawing has a child-like style with simple shapes and bright colors, showing some effort but with basic details and uneven labeling.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate basic elements of one land and one water habitat, including some plants and animals. The student can label a few items but not all, indicating an emerging understanding. The drawings show basic descriptions and lack detailed comparative insights, like the student may miss key differences or similarities between habitats, aligning with their developing level."
