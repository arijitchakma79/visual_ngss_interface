  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two different habitats, showing a basic representation of one land and one water habitat.",
    "The student can attempt to draw plants and animals found in each habitat, possibly using some observations or media resources.",
    "The student can label a few types of living things, such as some animals or plants, in each habitat.",
    "The student might observe that certain living things are only in one habitat, recognizing some patterns of diversity."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly contrast the types of living things between the land and water habitat (e.g., may miss key differences or similarities).",
    "The student might not correctly or fully label all the different types of living things (e.g., omits names or uses incorrect ones).",
    "The student might not accurately present organized data to reflect detailed patterns of biodiversity (e.g., scattered in representation).",
    "The student might show incomplete understanding of how diversity varies between the habitats (e.g., mixes traits or habitat-specific organisms)."
