  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw two habitats to show what lives in each one. First, I'll draw a land habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll start by drawing tall trees with green leaves. I also know birds live in trees, so I'll draw a couple of birds perched on the branches. Now, I'll add a smaller animal like a squirrel on the ground. I know I should label them but sometimes I mix those up, so I’ll try to be careful. Next, I’ll draw the water habitat. For the water, I’ll make wavy blue lines to show it's underwater. I'll draw a fish swimming and some seaweed growing. Oh, and I’ll add a turtle near the seaweed. Again, I need to label these correctly but sometimes I forget. I should include more animals, but I'll stick with a few types for now.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of two distinct habitats. On the left, depict a forest habitat with tall trees with green leaves. Include a couple of labeled birds in the branches and a squirrel on the ground, though the labels might be mixed up. On the right, show a water habitat with wavy blue lines for the water. Illustrate a fish, some seaweed, and a turtle, again with some labels potentially incorrect. Use a simple, colorful, childlike drawing style to reflect a student's perspective.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict two habitats with plants and animals specific to each. It mirrors their attempt to label, while accounting for potential mislabeling. The drawing reflects a variety of life in each habitat, but not an exhaustive range, which aligns with their proficiency level and common misunderstandings."
