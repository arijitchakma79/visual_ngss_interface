  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two habitats. Let's start with a land habitat. I remember seeing squirrels and trees at the park, so I'll draw a big green tree and a little brown squirrel under it. Maybe I can add some grass too, but I don't know how to draw many other animals. Now for a water habitat. I think ponds have fish, so I'll draw a big, friendly fish in blue water. I'll add some wavy lines for water, but I'm not sure what else to put here. Oh, I could put the same type of tree near the water even though I'm not really sure if it's supposed to be there. I like dogs, but I know they don't live in the water, so I won't add them here.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two separate scenes: On the left, a green tree with a brown trunk stands on green grass, with a small brown squirrel nearby. On the right, blue wavy water has a large fish swimming in it. Both scenes are simple, colorful, and drawn with crayon-like textures. The tree appears in both scenes, inconsistently blending habitats. The overall style is basic and playful, with limited diversity in living things depicted.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by depicting simple scenes with recognizable elements like a tree, squirrel, and fish. It acknowledges the student's limitations by resulting in minimal diversity; similar trees appear in both scenes, showcasing a missed opportunity to highlight habitat differences. The playful, simple style reflects the student's developing understanding and effort."
