  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two different habitats with living things in them. I’ll start with a land habitat. I remember that trees are common there, so I'll draw some tall green trees with brown trunks. I'll add some animals too – maybe a deer because they live in forests. I'll put some grass on the ground. Now, for the water habitat, it should have things like fish. I'll draw a big blue space with waves to show water and add some fish, maybe a couple of different kinds like an orange clownfish and a grey shark. I know plants grow underwater too, so I'll try to show some seaweed. I'm not sure exactly what else I should add, and I hope I didn't mess up by putting a wrong animal in the wrong place. My drawings may not be very organized: I just put the habitats close to each other, and I hope you can tell them apart easily.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two separate habitats. On the left, draw a simple land habitat with green trees with brown trunks, patches of green grass, and a deer. There is a simple blue sky above. On the right, draw a water habitat with light blue water, waves, a couple of fish including an orange clownfish and a grey shark, and some green seaweed. Use basic colors, and make the animals and plants clear but not overly detailed, showing the effort of a student at a developing stage.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to create basic elements of diverse habitats. The student can depict simple land and water environments and include a few different living things in each, but lacks clear distinction and detail in representing biodiversity. Errors in habitat placement and organization reflect the student's struggles."
