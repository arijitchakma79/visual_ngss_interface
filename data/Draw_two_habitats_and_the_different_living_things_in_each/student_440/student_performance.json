  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to distinctly compare the living things between both habitats, missing more nuanced differences (student does not fully understand diversity).",
    "The student might show limited organization in their drawings, resulting in less clear representation of patterns of plant and animal diversity (lack of clear separation between habitats).",
    "The student may incorrectly place some animals or plants in inappropriate habitats (e.g., placing a fish in a land habitat) due to misunderstanding or guessing."
