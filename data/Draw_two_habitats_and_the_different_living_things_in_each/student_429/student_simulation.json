  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two different habitats. I’ll start with a land habitat. I think a forest is a type of land habitat, so I’ll draw some trees. I remember trees have trunks and leaves, so I’ll sketch a few with brown trunks and green tops. I want to add an animal, so I’ll draw a squirrel. I know squirrels are small with bushy tails, so I’ll try to draw that next to a tree. Now for the second habitat, I’ll do a water habitat. I think a lake is a good example. I’ll draw water at the bottom of the picture. Since fish live in water, I’ll draw a simple fish shape. I’ll try to add another animal; maybe a turtle, because I’ve seen them in water before. I’ll draw a turtle on the edge of the water. I want to label some things, like ‘tree’ and ‘fish’. I know I should add more plants or animals, but I can’t think of anything else right now. I’ll leave it as it is.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple drawing of two habitats side by side. The first habitat is a forest with a few simple trees with brown trunks and green foliage. Next to one of the trees, there's a small, roughly drawn squirrel with a bushy tail. The second habitat is a lake with blue water. In the water, there's a fish illustrated with a basic fish shape. Near the edge of the water, a turtle is drawn with a simple shell and limbs. The drawing is in a child's style with bright colors and basic shapes, and has labels such as 'tree' and 'fish'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's level by focusing on basic representations of habitats without detailing plant or animal diversity. The drawing includes one or two living things per habitat and labels are limited. The approach matches the student's emerging understanding and effort to depict recognizable elements."
