  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two basic habitats, providing some details like trees and water in a land habitat and water features in a water habitat (habitats may be simplified).",
    "The student can include a few recognizable living things in each habitat, such as a tree, fish, and a simple animal like a lizard or squirrel.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately depict a variety of plants and animals in each habitat, potentially missing important species or diversity (student may only draw 1 or 2 living things per habitat).",
    "The student may not show differences and similarities in the types of plants across the two habitats (plants might look the same in both environments).",
    "The student might not effectively illustrate differences and similarities in the types of animals between the habitats (animals may appear randomly placed without regard to environmental needs).",
    "The student does not provide clear or complete notes or symbols to represent how data were collected or observed (notes may be absent or not meaningful)."
