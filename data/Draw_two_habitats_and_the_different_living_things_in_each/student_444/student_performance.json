  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and draw two different habitats, one land-based and one water-based, but the drawing may lack detail or be somewhat simplistic.",
    "The student can include at least one type of plant and one type of animal in each habitat, such as a tree and a squirrel in the land habitat or a fish and an aquatic plant in the water habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to label or differentiate between types of plants and animals accurately (e.g., drawing a fish in the land habitat).",
    "The student may not visually compare and contrast the diversity of plants and animals between the two habitats, leading to similar looking drawings for both habitats (student might think all environments look the same).",
    "Patterns of biodiversity might be inconsistently represented, with repetitive or incorrect placement of living things (e.g., placing land animals in the water habitat)."
