  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats. First, I remember a land habitat might include a grassy area, so I’ll draw some grass and a big tree. I think I should include an animal, like a squirrel, because I saw one climb a tree once. Next, I’ll draw a water habitat on the same page. I’ll make some wavy lines for water and draw a fish swimming in it. I know plants live in water too, so I’ll add a seaweed next to the fish. I’m not sure what else to add, so maybe the tree and the fish can both be brown because I'm not totally sure what colors I should choose for each habitat. Just to be safe, I’ll draw another squirrel in the water because maybe they can go anywhere. I feel like both habitats look kind of similar, but that’s okay, I tried to add at least one plant and one animal in each.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing featuring two simple habitats side by side on the same page. On the left, there's a basic land habitat with a large tree and short grass, colored primarily in green and brown. A squirrel is drawn on the tree. On the right is a water habitat, with blue wavy lines to represent water. There's a fish in the water, colored in brown, alongside a green aquatic plant resembling seaweed. The style is rudimentary and charmingly simplistic, showing effort at identifying different habitats but with some misplaced species like a brown squirrel also appearing in the water habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'can do' by including a land-based habitat with a tree and a squirrel, and a water-based habitat with a fish and an aquatic plant. It reflects the 'cannot do' by showing the student’s struggle with correctly differentiating and misplacing animals, like placing a squirrel in the water, and using similar colors for different habitats, indicating difficulty in visual comparison and contrast."
