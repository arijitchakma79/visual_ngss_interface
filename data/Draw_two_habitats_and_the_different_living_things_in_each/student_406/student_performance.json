  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw simple shapes or blobs that may represent different areas but lacks clarity on what they signify (could be random or generic shapes representing land and water).",
    "Include a couple of living things in the drawing, but they may not be distinctly different or specific to the habitat (e.g., draw a fish but include it in both habitats)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Identify and clearly label each living thing in the drawing (items may be unlabelled or labelled incorrectly, e.g., calls a tree a 'flower').",
    "Show diversity or variety of plants and animals specific to each habitat (may use the same few living things for both habitats without showing differences).",
    "Demonstrate patterns or understand that different types of plants and animals live in different habitats (draws all living things randomly without distinguishing between habitats).",
    "Organize information in a way that clearly shows comparisons between the two habitats (places all living things together in a disorganized manner, with no separation between land and water habitats)."
