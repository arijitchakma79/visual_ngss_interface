  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different habitats and the living things in each. First, I'll draw two big shapes. One can be wavy like water, and the other can be bigger and round like a land area. I think I’ll add a fish shape to both since I know fish are living things. I'll put another blob that looks like a tree, but I might call it a flower because I'm not too sure. Maybe I'll draw a circle that could be an animal like a bird and use it in both places. I'm not sure which plants or animals go in which habitat, so I’ll mix them up in both places.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like drawing of two distinct habitats. One habitat is represented by a wavy blue shape, symbolizing water, while the other is a larger, round green shape to represent land. Include a few basic, unlabeled shapes: a simple fish-like shape in blue in both habitats, a green blob that looks like a tree or flower, and a red circle that could be an animal like a bird, placed in both habitats. The colors should be basic and bright, with a crayon or marker-style finish for simplicity.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt describes a drawing that lacks clear organization and labeling, aligning with the student's minimal understanding. Similar living things are placed in both habitats without differentiation, showing a lack of awareness about habitat-specific plants and animals, which matches the inability to show diversity or organize information clearly. The colors and shapes are basic and undetailed, matching the student's level of representation."
