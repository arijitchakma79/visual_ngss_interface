  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw two habitats, but I'm not really sure how to make them different. I'll start by drawing two big shapes on my paper. I'll make one shape wavy and the other one more round. Maybe that's a good start. Now, let's add some living things. I'll draw a tree with a big trunk and some green leaves. Trees are usually in habitats, right? I'm not really sure which shape it should go in, so I'll just put it in both. I'll also draw a fish. Fish live in water, but I guess I'll draw it in both shapes too, just to be safe. Oh, I know about flowers! I'll draw a big flower with a yellow center and pink petals in both habitats. This is looking nice, but I really don't know if I've put them in the right places. Maybe I should add labels, but I'm not sure what to write, so I'll skip that part.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two large, undefined shapes that represent habitats. In each shape, there is a tree with a brown trunk and green leaves, a fish colored light blue, and a large flower with a yellow center and pink petals. The shapes and animals are drawn in crayon with no specific labels. The elements are repeated in both habitats with no clear distinction, illustrating a beginner's understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by having them draw two shapes and include a recognizable plant and animal, like a tree and a fish. It also shows what the student struggles with by placing the same elements in both shapes without distinction and not providing labels. This demonstrates their lack of understanding in differentiating between habitats and the concept of variety within each one."
