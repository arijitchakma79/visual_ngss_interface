  "Reasoning": "I'll draw two different habitats. For the first one, I'll draw a forest. I remember that a forest has lots of trees, so I'll start with those. I'll sketch some simple green trees with trunks, maybe two or three to keep it simple. I think forests have lizards, so I'll draw a small lizard on the ground and label it. For the second habitat, I'll draw a pond. I'll draw some blue water to show it's a pond. I remember that ponds have plants too, so I'll add some green bushes around the edges of the water. I know fish live in ponds, so I'll draw a fish under the water and label it. I might add a frog on a lily pad since I’ve seen frogs in ponds before. Although I know there are more animals and plants in these habitats, I’m not sure which ones belong to each, so I'll stick to what I know. I’ll make sure each habitat looks different by keeping one mostly green with trees and the other blue with water.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two different habitats. On the left, a simple forest with green trees, a brown-trunked tree, and a small lizard on the ground, all drawn with basic shapes and colors. On the right, a pond with blue water, some simple green bushes around it, a fish in the water, and a frog on a lily pad. The style is simplistic and colorful, with basic labels for each living thing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it demonstrates a basic understanding of two distinct habitats with key differences: trees and a lizard for the forest, water and a fish for the pond. The prompt also reflects the limitations, as the student includes only a few types of plants and animals without detailed species distinction, avoiding more complex biodiversity or habitat comparisons."
