  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two habitats with basic differentiation, such as a simplistic representation of land (e.g., a forest) and water (e.g., a pond).",
    "The student can label a few basic plants in each habitat, possibly showing trees in the land habitat and a few water plants in the water habitat.",
    "The student can include and label some animals in each habitat, like drawing a few common animals such as a lizard in the forest or a fish in the pond."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to illustrate or identify a wide variety of plants or make detailed distinctions between different plant species (e.g., they might draw only one or two types of plants with no distinction of species).",
    "The student may not show a thorough variety of animals in each habitat, potentially omitting some or illustrating incorrect animals in a habitat (e.g., drawing a dolphin in a pond).",
    "The student may struggle to compare the different types of living things across habitats effectively, possibly due to misconceptions about biodiversity (e.g., thinking all animals can live in any habitat).",
    "The student might not identify patterns related to plant and animal diversity in each habitat, possibly treating all habitats as hosting similar communities (e.g., drawing the same animals in both habitats)."
