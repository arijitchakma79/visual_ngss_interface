  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two big areas on my paper. On the left, I’ll draw a land habitat. I remember it should have trees and grasses, so I’ll draw some tall trees and maybe a few smaller bushes too. For the animals, I’ll include a squirrel and a lizard because I know these live on land. Let me add some birds flying in the sky because I see birds a lot in these places. On the right side, I’ll draw the water habitat. Fish are definitely in water, so I’ll draw a few different kinds of fish swimming. I remember seeing some plants in water too, like those long ones that look like grass, so I’ll add some of those. I’m not sure what other plants look like in water, but I’ll just add these. I don’t think about insects under the leaves or smaller plants underneath the trees, so I won’t draw those. Oh, I might forget to label all the animals if I’m not careful. I know both habitats should look different with different things living in them, so I’ll try to use different colors and shapes. I understand there are complex reasons why certain animals and plants live in these places, but I just need to show the basics. I’m going to use bright colors to make it look good, even if I don't have to explain everything.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, childlike drawing showing two habitats side by side. The left side features a land habitat with tall green trees and short bushes. There are simple drawings of a squirrel and a lizard, with a couple of birds flying overhead. The right side shows a water habitat with various fish, including different shapes and colors, and some aquatic plants resembling long grass. Both habitats are illustrated with bright colors and simple shapes, capturing basic biodiversity. The drawing style should be playful and somewhat naive, reflecting a child’s perspective.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's capabilities and limitations by showing two distinct habitats with a basic variety of living things. The land habitat includes prominent elements like trees, bushes, and common animals they can remember. The water habitat features fish and simple aquatic plants. It does not include less obvious details like understory plants or insects, aligning with the student's potential oversight. The drawing style and use of bright colors reflect the student's level, focusing on broad patterns rather than complex details."
