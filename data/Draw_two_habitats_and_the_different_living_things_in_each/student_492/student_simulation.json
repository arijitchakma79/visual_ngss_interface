  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats side by side on my paper; a forest on the left and a pond on the right. I remember that in a forest, there are lots of trees, so I'll draw tall trees with green leaves. I'll add some grasses and flowers under the trees. For animals, I'll draw a few squirrels in the trees and maybe some birds flying above. Now, for the pond habitat, I'll draw water with some lily pads and reeds around the edge. I'll add a fish swimming in the pond. I think frogs sit on lily pads, so I'll draw a couple. I'll make sure the fish and frogs are only in the pond, not on the land. I should also compare what’s in the forest versus the pond. I'll label the trees, grasses, fish, and any other animals I include. I might forget to label one of the smaller plants like ferns, and I need to remember terms like 'flora' aren’t explained. I have to be careful with the sizes, too; I shouldn't make the fish as big as a tree, but sometimes I forget proportions. I'll use bright colors to make it vibrant, with greens for the forest, blues for the water, and add other colors for the animals and plants.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a forest with tall, green-leaved trees, grasses, and colorful flowers should have squirrels in the trees and birds in the sky. On the right, a pond with blue water featuring lily pads and reeds, with a fish swimming and frogs perched on the pads. Use a mix of bright, natural colors. Label each plant and animal, but leave one small plant like a fern unlabeled. Maintain moderate size proportions; a fish should not be as large as a tree. Use a simple, child-like drawing style with noticeable, clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by accurately depicting two distinct habitats and the specific plants and animals found in each, as the student can do. It addresses possible mistakes, like omitting a label for a smaller plant and cautioning on the size proportions, reflecting the student's struggles. The use of bright colors and a child-like drawing style aligns with an advanced student's ability to create a complete and visually engaging representation of the task."
