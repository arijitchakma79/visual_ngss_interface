  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label a basic land habitat with at least one or two living things, such as a tree and an animal like a squirrel or ant.",
    "The student can draw and label a basic water habitat with at least one or two aquatic living things, such as a fish and a plant.",
    "The student can make an attempt to compare differences between the two habitats but may do so in a rudimentary or inconsistent manner."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unable to fully illustrate the diversity of life in each habitat, often missing less obvious organisms (e.g., does not include bushes in the land habitat or clams in the water habitat).",
    "The student struggles to clearly show how living things are specifically suited to their habitats, potentially mixing attributes (e.g., placing a land animal in the water habitat or showing a tree underwater).",
    "The student may have difficulty organizing their drawing to highlight diversity and may not consistently apply labels or comparisons between the two habitats."
