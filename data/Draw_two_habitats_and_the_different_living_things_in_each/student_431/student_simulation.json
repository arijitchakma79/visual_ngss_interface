  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different habitats. First, I'll draw a land habitat. I remember learning that forests have animals like squirrels and lizards, so I'll draw a big round shape as a tree in the middle of the paper. I can add a little triangle for a squirrel on the branch and a small lizard at the base. Maybe I should add a bush too, even though I'm not sure what it looks like exactly. Now, for a water habitat, I'll draw a wavy line for the water because that's how water looks in cartoons. I remember fish live in water, so I'll draw a simple fish with a big oval body and a triangle tail. I feel like there should be a plant here, like seaweed, so I'll draw tall, wavy lines. I remember fish can't live on land, but I'm not sure about other animals, so I'll just leave it. I don't think of many more plants or animals to put in the habitats. My drawings are pretty simple, maybe too simple.",
  "Prompt": "A simplistic drawing showing two habitats: On the left, a land habitat with a large round tree in the center, a small triangle shaped squirrel on a branch, and a little lizard at the tree's base; to the right, a bush near the tree. On the right, a wavy line represents a water habitat, featuring a simple fish with an oval body and triangle tail swimming, with tall, wavy lines resembling seaweed. The style is child-like, using basic shapes and bright colors like greens and browns for land, and blues and greens for water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it incorporates basic, recognizable shapes for each habitat. The land habitat features simple elements like a tree, bush, and a few basic animals, consistent with what the student can do. The water habitat has a simple fish and seaweed drawn with basic lines. The prompt stays true to the student's struggle by not including detailed or diverse plants and animals, and it does not depict any fish or animals incorrectly placed in the wrong habitat."
