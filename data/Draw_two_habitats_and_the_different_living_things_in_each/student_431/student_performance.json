  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two different habitats, including one land habitat and one water habitat, though the representation may be simplistic (e.g., a basic shape for land and a wavy line for water).",
    "The student can include some basic representations of plants in each habitat, such as simple trees or bushes in the land habitat (perhaps missing grasses or flowers).",
    "The student can include some animals in each habitat, such as a few recognizable ones like fish in the water and a squirrel or lizard on land."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately label or differentiate between a high variety of plants and animals in each habitat (e.g., might think a fish can live on land too).",
    "The student may struggle to show patterns or highlight the diversity of life in each habitat, often including limited types without showing a range (e.g., might have only one type of plant and animal per habitat)."
