  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a land habitat, like a forest. I’ll include several trees with green leaves and brown trunks. I should add animals that live there, like squirrels and birds. I can also add bushes and maybe some insects near the ground, like ants. For the water habitat, I’ll draw a pond. I’ll add fish, clams, and aquatic plants like algae. I remember that frogs sometimes live near ponds, so I’ll add a few on lily pads. I will make sure to label some of the animals and plants to make it clear what they are. I need to remember to show how these habitats are different but also have some similar parts, like both having plants. I’ll use labels to make sure all parts are clear, even if I might mix up some size relationships, like making a squirrel a bit too big compared to a tree.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed illustration of two habitats: a forest and a pond. The forest habitat features green-leaved and brown-trunked trees, bushes, and squirrels climbing or foraging. Several birds are perched on branches, and ants are crawling on the forest floor. The pond habitat includes blue water with fish swimming underneath, clams, and aquatic plants like algae. There are lily pads with frogs sitting on them. Pay attention to the wide variety of animals, including less obvious ones like insects. Labels are present to identify various objects. The drawing is colorful, detailed, and realistic, with some minor scale inaccuracies.",
  "Explanation": "The prompt describes a drawing that includes extensive biodiversity and attention to detail, reflecting the student’s strengths in creating a detailed representation of both habitats. The labels and variety of organisms showcase understanding of biodiversity, while minor mentions of scale inaccuracies align with typical minor struggles the student faces in labeling and scaling. The added elements like frogs on lily pads highlight the advanced level of representation expected at the student’s level."
