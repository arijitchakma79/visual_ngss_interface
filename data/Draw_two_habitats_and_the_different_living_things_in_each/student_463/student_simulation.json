  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two habitats, one on land and one in water. For the land habitat, I'll draw a forest because I know forests grow big trees. I'll start with tall trees and remember to label one as a 'tree.' I think adding a few smaller plants or bushes will show more diversity. I'll also draw some birds because they live in trees; I’ll label them too. I remember frogs can be near water, so I’ll draw one on the ground and label it. Now, I'll work on the water habitat. I'll draw a pond or a small lake. I need to put some fish in the water because that's where they live. I should also draw and label seaweed under the water. Above the pond, I’ll add a dragonfly because I see them near water. Although I try to label everything, I might forget one. I match different animals to each habitat, though sometimes I forget to write what makes them unique to that habitat. Besides, the drawing might get a bit cluttered since I put animals and plants close to each other. I wish I could make the differences between water and land animals clearer.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child's drawing showing two habitats: a forest and a pond. On the left, illustrate a forest with tall green trees, some bushes, and birds flying above. Include a frog on the ground nearby. On the right, depict a pond with fish swimming and seaweed underwater; show a dragonfly hovering above. Use simple labels for 'tree,' 'bird,' 'frog,' 'fish,' and 'seaweed.' Drawings should be colorful with crayons or markers, showing a playful, moderately organized scene.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict and label two different habitats. The forest with trees and birds and the pond with fish and dragonflies reflect a basic understanding of habitat-specific organisms. Labels are used, consistent with their ability, though some might be missing. The mix of plants and animals in each habitat showcases diversity, while potential clutter and overlap represent the student's difficulty with clear organization and differentiation."
