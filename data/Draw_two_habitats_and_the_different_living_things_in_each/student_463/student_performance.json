  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and illustrate two different habitats, one on land and one in water.",
    "The student can draw and label different types of plants in each habitat but may miss one or two labels (e.g., tree, seaweed).",
    "The student can draw and label various animals present in each habitat, showing an understanding of habitat-specific organisms (e.g., fish in water, birds on land).",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently compare and contrast the types of living things in the two habitats, possibly omitting explicit differences (e.g., may not note that fish are exclusive to water).",
    "The student might struggle with organizing their drawing for maximum clarity. Some elements may be cluttered or not clearly differentiated (e.g., plants and animals may not be easily distinguishable due to overlap)."
