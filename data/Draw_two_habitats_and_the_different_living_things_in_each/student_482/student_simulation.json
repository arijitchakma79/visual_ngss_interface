  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two boxes on my paper - one for a land habitat and one for a water habitat. In the land habitat, I remember that I need to add trees, so I'll draw different types, like a tall oak tree and a smaller bush. I'll add some grass patches on the ground too. Now I’ll add animals like a deer, a rabbit, and some birds in the trees, such as a robin. I should remember to include a lizard on a rock, since lizards live on land. For insects, I'll add a butterfly and a bee flying around the flowers. Next, I’ll draw the water habitat. I'll include some wavy lines to represent water, like a pond. In the water, I'll include fish, like a blue fish and a yellow fish. I remember to add aquatic plants like seaweed and lily pads. I'll draw a frog sitting on a lily pad because frogs live near water. I'll add a duck swimming on top of the water. In the sky above the water, I'll include a dragonfly. I need to make sure I show how these animals and plants live in these habitats, so I’ll draw the fish underwater and the birds in the trees. I might forget to label one of the plants correctly, though, but I'll try to remember. I'll draw everything using bright, bold colors to show the different habitats clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing of two distinct habitats. On the left, a vibrant land habitat with a tall oak tree, a bush, grass patches, and animals like a deer, a rabbit, and birds (robin) in the trees. A lizard is on a rock and insects such as a butterfly and a bee are near flowering plants. On the right side, a clear depiction of a water habitat with water shown by waving lines. Fish swim in the water with colors like blue and yellow. There are aquatic plants like seaweed and lily pads. A frog sits on a lily pad and a duck is on the water’s surface. A dragonfly is above the water. The style is colorful and playful, suitable for a child’s art project.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to accurately depict two different habitats, including diverse living organisms, in a colorful and well-structured manner. The attention to detail in adding different plants and animals shows the higher level of understanding and accuracy. However, the potential to mislabel a minor detail is acknowledged, aligning with their tendency to sometimes make small errors in labeling. The drawing style is consistent with an advanced level, providing a complete representation but with room for minor inaccuracies."
