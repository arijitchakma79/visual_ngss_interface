  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the land habitat, which can be a garden. I remember that gardens have trees, grasses, and bushes. I'll draw a big tree on the left side with green leaves and a brown trunk. I'll add some bushes next to it, making them round and fluffy with a darker green. Below the bushes, I'll sketch some grass, keeping it short and spiky. I'll label each of these parts: tree, bush, and grass. Now, I’ll draw a water habitat, like a pond, on the right. I’ll put some wavy blue lines for water to show it’s a pond. I remember ponds have fish, so I’ll draw a couple with a simple fish shape, like ovals with tails. There are also plants in ponds, like reeds, so I’ll add some tall green plants along the edge. I might forget to add smaller things like ants or clams, so I won’t include them here. I should compare the habitats now; the land habitat has large trees, while the water habitat has aquatic plants. However, I might not show a variety of plant sizes or elaborate on the types of fish versus other animals. I'll make sure to label the pond, fish, and aquatic plants too. This should show the differences between the two habitats clearly enough.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with two distinct habitats. On the left, illustrate a land habitat with a large green tree, round green bushes, and short green grass. Label these elements clearly. On the right, depict a water habitat featuring blue waves to indicate a pond, with a couple of simple fish shapes swimming in it and tall green reeds along the water's edge. Ensure these elements are labeled. The drawing should be colorful and have a childlike style, reflecting effort and understanding at a proficient level, but not overly detailed.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to clearly and correctly represent the main elements of each habitat, aligning with what the student can do. Labels for larger, more obvious elements like trees and fish are included, while smaller elements like ants and clams, which the student cannot yet label consistently, are not part of the image. Additionally, the focus remains on major visual differences between the habitats, aligning with the student's proficiency level."
