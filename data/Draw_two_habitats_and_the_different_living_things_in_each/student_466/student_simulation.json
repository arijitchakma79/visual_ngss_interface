  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest for my land habitat. I think a forest has lots of trees, so I’ll draw tall trees with wide leaves. I know there are animals like birds, so I’ll draw a bird in a tree. Then, I'll add some plants on the ground, maybe some bushes. For the ground, I'll add a few mushrooms. Next, I’ll move to the second habitat which is a pond. A pond has water, so I'll draw a body of water with some lily pads. I think there are fish in a pond, so I’ll draw a fish swimming. I'll add a frog on a lily pad and some tall grass around the edges. I need to show at least three different living things in each habitat. While I remember to draw different types of living things, I sometimes forget to label everything, so I might not label all the plants or animals. I’ll try to compare by showing different things living in each habitat but I might not think of all the reasons they're different.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, illustrate a forest with tall green trees, a bird in the branches, small bushes, and mushrooms on the forest floor. On the right, draw a pond with blue water, a fish swimming, a frog on a lily pad, and tall green grass outlining the pond. Use bright, vivid colors with a child-like drawing style, where elements are clear yet simplified. Some elements like plants and animals may lack labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what I can do by including two different habitats with specific living things in each, like trees and mushrooms in the forest and fish and frogs in the pond. It includes comparing the diversity by showing different living things in each habitat. It also captures my struggles by not explicitly labeling all elements, leading to some possible confusion about specific plants or animals."
