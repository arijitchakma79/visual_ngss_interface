  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two habitats. First, I'll draw something that looks like water. Maybe I can make it look wavy so people know it's water. Okay, I finished the squiggly shape. Now, I should put something that lives in water. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a simple fish with a triangle for the tail. Alright, now for the other habitat. I think land would be good. I'll draw a shape that looks like a bumpy hill. Hmm, I need to put something that lives on land. I'll draw a tree because I know trees are on land, not water. I'm not sure what else to add, so I'll leave it like that. I hope these look like two different places even though I don't know if I'm supposed to put any more living things.",
  "Prompt": "A simple and childlike drawing with two distinct areas: one with wavy, blue squiggles representing water with an orange fish, and another with a green, uneven shape representing land with a single green tree. The drawing uses basic shapes and minimal details, showing a beginning level of understanding of habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do, such as drawing basic shapes to represent two different habitats and including a single living thing in each habitatâ€”fish in water and a tree on land. It also reflects what the student cannot do, as the drawing lacks detail, diversity of living things, and clear understanding of habitat functionality. No clear patterns of diversity or accurate representations of habitat-specific animals are depicted, which aligns with the student's current understanding level."
