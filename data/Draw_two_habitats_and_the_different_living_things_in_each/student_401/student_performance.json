  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately depict a variety of living things in each habitat (e.g., only one type of living thing, without diversity).",
    "The student may not be able to show how the habitats support different living things (e.g., same animals in both habitats).",
    "The student may misunderstand what constitutes a habitat (e.g., drawing everyday objects or non-living features like a car or house as part of the habitat).",
    "The student may not illustrate clear patterns of diversity between the habitats (e.g., drawing a lizard in water and a fish on land)."
