  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two different habitats. First, I'll try to draw a place with land, like a forest, because I remember that forests have trees. I'll use some big round shapes for the trees, but I'm not sure if I need to draw different plants. Now, I'll draw a water place, maybe a little pond, but I’ll put one or two trees there as well for some variety. I'll draw some round fish shapes in the water and birds in the sky because I know they can fly. I think I’ll draw a deer and a squirrel on the land, and maybe an elephant because they are cool. I want to add fish next to a tree because it looks nice next to the land drawings. I’m not sure if I need other kinds of animals or plants specific to each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two habitats side by side. On the left, a simple representation of a forest with big, round, bright green shapes for trees, and a brown shape for a deer standing, with a squirrel nearby. On the right, a water habitat with blue wavy lines representing water, a round yellow sun, clouds, and some simple, round fish in the water. There are trees in this water habitat too, and a bird figure in the sky. An elephant stands near both the habitats. The colors should be bright and bold, and the drawing should feel like a child's effort, with sloppy or incorrect placements, like fish near tree and a lack of specific plant diversity.",
  "Explaination": "This drawing aligns with the student's level because it shows an attempt to depict two habitats, but includes elements from both habitats mixed together, like trees in both land and water areas and fish next to a tree. The similarities in plant and animal placements across the landscapes reflect the student's struggle to differentiate habitats specifically. The lack of detailed plant diversity and specific characteristic features of each habitat like unique plants or animals also matches the student's minimal understanding."
