  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two different habitats. I think I'll start with the forest because I know several animals and plants that live there. First, I'll sketch the trees; they're tall with thick trunks, and I'll make sure to add some branches and leaves. I'll draw a deer next because they often live in forests; it has antlers and a brown body. I also need to add some smaller animals like squirrels with bushy tails and perhaps a bird like a woodpecker perched on one of the trees. Now, I'll add some plants like ferns and mushrooms on the forest floor, as I remember seeing those when I visited a forest on a school trip. For the second habitat, I'll draw a pond. I remember reading that ponds have a lot of different kinds of life. I'll start by drawing the water, making it look blue and adding some small waves to show movement. I'll add a frog on a lily pad, with its green, textured skin. Don't forget the fish swimming beneath the water—maybe an orange fish. I’ll sketch some tall grass around the edge of the pond and a dragonfly hovering above the water. Now, I'll label the habitats as 'Forest' and 'Pond.' I'll write the names of the animals and plants near them, like 'Deer,' 'Squirrel,' 'Frog,' and 'Fish.' Most of the names should be correct, but I might forget one or two less obvious species' details. I'll make sure each habitat shows the different life forms, even if I might not remember all the proper names. I wish I knew the scientific names for some of them, but I’ll use the common names I know.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing two habitats: a forest on the left and a pond on the right. In the forest, draw tall trees with green leaves, a deer with antlers, a squirrel, and a woodpecker on a tree. Include ferns and mushrooms on the ground. For the pond, depict blue water with small waves, a green frog on a lily pad, an orange fish in the water, tall grasses around the pond, and a dragonfly overhead. Use colored pencils to add vibrant and natural colors, and add labels for 'Forest' and 'Pond' with the names of the plants and animals next to them. The style should be detailed but a bit inconsistent in less commonly known species.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt highlights the student's ability to depict two distinct habitats with a variety of living things, demonstrating diversity as expected at an advanced level. The student's use of common names instead of scientific ones and the possible omission of some smaller species' details are included in the description, aligning with what they might struggle with. The suggested style reflects their competent drawing skills, capturing the advanced level of detail they can achieve, but with minor inconsistencies in certain areas."
