  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest as one of the habitats. I remember that forests have lots of tall trees, so I'll add some green pine trees and brown oak trees with nests for birds. I'll draw squirrels, some lizards on the ground, and tiny ants crawling around to show different animals. I'll add bushes and colorful flowers for variety. In the second habitat, I'll illustrate a pond. I'll start with blue water and add green lily pads. There's a variety of animals in the pond habitat, so I'll draw fish below the surface and a few clams at the bottom. I'll also add frogs on the banks and some dragonflies hovering above the water. I need to make sure I don’t draw fish in the forest, because that would be wrong. Occasionally, I might forget to label some creatures, but my main focus is on keeping the habitats and their living things distinct. I’ll occasionally mix up labels, but I'll fix them if I notice. It’s important to show the different plants and animals clearly so that the two habitats look very different.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two distinct ecosystems. On the left, a vibrant forest with green pine trees, brown oak trees, bushes, and colorful flowers. Animals include squirrels, lizards on the ground, and ants. On the right, a pond habitat with blue water, green lily pads, fish beneath the surface, frogs on the banks, and dragonflies above. Clams are at the bottom of the pond. Each habitat is decorated with specific details to show diverse living things, using clear bright colors. The drawing style is detailed yet suitable for a young student, with occasional missing or corrected labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to distinguish between two habitats clearly and include a variety of plants and animals within each one. It reflects the student's proficiency in showing biodiversity and characteristic details, aligns with the advanced level description, and acknowledges minor issues like label omissions and corrections if necessary."
