  "Reasoning": "I'll start by thinking about the two habitats I need to draw. One should be a land habitat, like a forest, and the other one should be a water habitat, like an ocean. I'll begin with the forest. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw some big trees with green leaves. I'll add squirrels and birds sitting on the branches. Squirrels have bushy tails, and birds come in different colors, so I'll use brown and different shades of blue and red for the birds. Near the bottom of the forest, I'll add some small bushes and flowers, maybe some rabbits hopping around. Now, for the ocean, I'll draw wavy blue water at the top. I'll include fish swimming, using colors like orange and yellow, and I'll draw seaweed swaying in the water. Coral can add nice pinks and purples. I have to remember jellyfish, with their translucent bodies, and maybe a turtle with a green shell. I'll try to show differences between the habitats; for example, the forest has trees with wood trunks while the ocean has coral and seaweed. Oh, I should label everything, although sometimes I forget, so I must be careful. There might be some things in the environment like clouds in the forest or some sea shimmer in the ocean I couldâ€™ve included more, but I think my habitats and creatures will still look complete and clear.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed drawing of two side-by-side habitats. On the left, illustrate a lush forest with tall green trees, colorful birds perched on branches, and brown squirrels on the ground. Add details like bushes, flowers, and hopping rabbits in natural colors. On the right, show an ocean habitat with wavy blue water, vibrant fish in orange and yellow, swaying green seaweed, vibrant corals in pink and purple, translucent jellyfish, and a turtle with a green shell. Use a realistic hand-drawn style, with labels for each living thing, colorful, engaging, and accurately depicting the distinct characteristics of each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict both a forest and an ocean habitat clearly, accurately drawing and labeling a wide variety of organisms in each. It reflects the student's ability to differentiate the habitats and illustrate the organisms with realistic colors and elements typical of those environments. While the student might forget to label occasional elements or miss minor habitat details like environmental features, the overall drawing should convey understanding and effort that aligns with their advanced level."
