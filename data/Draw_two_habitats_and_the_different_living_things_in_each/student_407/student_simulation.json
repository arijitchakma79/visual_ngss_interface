  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a square because I think that represents land, like a park or a playground. I’ll use a green color because parks usually have grass. Now, for water, I'll draw a wavy line next to the square. The wavy line will be blue because water is blue, like the ocean. I’m not sure what else to add, but I know trees are on land, so I’ll draw a tree inside the square. For water, I think of fish, so I’ll draw a fish next to the wavy line. I guess I can put a tree in the water too because I see pictures of trees in lakes sometimes. Hmm, maybe I should put a fish on the land in case they move there. Now, both habitats look more filled, but I’m not sure if that's right. I remember seeing a squirrel once, so I'll draw one somewhere in the middle, even though I don't know exactly where it belongs.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simplistic scene with two parts: on the left, a green square representing land with a tree and a fish; on the right, a blue wavy line representing water with another tree and a fish. Include a squirrel randomly placed between the two areas, not clearly belonging to either habitat. Use basic shapes and simple lines, reflecting a lack of detail and differentiation between the habitats. The drawing should give a naive and innocent feel to capture the beginner understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability because it includes basic shapes like squares and wavy lines for land and water, which the student can draw. The inclusion of common elements like trees and fish reflects the student's minimal understanding. Placing a tree and fish in both areas shows the student's misunderstanding of habitat-specific living things, as does positioning the squirrel without regard for the appropriate habitat."
