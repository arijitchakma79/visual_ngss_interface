  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw basic shapes to represent land and water habitats, such as a square to represent a playground or a wavy line for water, but with little detail or differentiation.",
    "The student might include a common plant or animal they know, like a tree or a fish, but placement is inconsistent and may not accurately reflect natural environment."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot accurately draw or label different types of habitats like a garden versus a lake; they might represent both as simple undefined blobs or shapes (student doesnâ€™t recognize different habitat types).",
    "The student does not include a variety of plants correctly; they might place a tree in both the land and water habitat without distinction (student assumes all types of living things exist everywhere).",
    "The student is unable to demonstrate the concept of different animals belonging to specific habitats; they might draw a fish on land and a squirrel in the water (misunderstanding habitat-specific living things).",
    "The student cannot show or articulate patterns of ecological relationships clearly, often drawing random animals without any habitat-based reasoning (random placement reflects lack of understanding)."
