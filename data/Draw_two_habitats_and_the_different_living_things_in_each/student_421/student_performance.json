  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw something resembling two different areas, possibly with basic shapes that could represent habitats (e.g., a blob for water and a flat area for land).",
    "The student may include a few basic shapes or symbols that are meant to represent plants or animals, though they might not be accurately portrayed or realistic."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately label the habitats or differentiate clearly between land and water habitats (e.g., uses the same symbols for both or labels them incorrectly).",
    "The student does not successfully show a diversity of plants and animals in each habitat and might use the same type of drawing or label for different living things (e.g., drawing a fish in a land habitat or a tree in a water habitat).",
    "The student may not be able to make clear comparisons between the habitats or show any variety, possibly drawing the same few plants and animals in both habitats (student does not understand different habitats support different life).",
    "The drawings may lack organization, with labels missing, incorrectly placed, or not present at all; the overall intention may be unclear (student does not see the need for organization or accuracy in labeling)."
