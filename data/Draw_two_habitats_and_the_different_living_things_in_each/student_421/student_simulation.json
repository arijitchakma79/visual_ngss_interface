  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm supposed to draw two habitats. I'll start by making a blob shape for water on the left. Then, I'll draw a flat area for land on the right. For the water, maybe I can draw something like a fish. I'll make an oval shape with a tail, but I'm not sure if it looks like a fish. I'll also try to draw a plant in the water, maybe a squiggly line? For the land, I know there are trees, so I'll make a tall rectangle with a circle on top; it sort of looks like a tree. Hmm, I can also try drawing an animal on the landâ€”maybe I'll make a circle with legs, like a bug or something. I don't remember what bugs really look like, though. I wonder if I should label things... I'm not really sure how, so I'll skip that for now. I hope this is right, even if it's just a bit mixed up.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side habitats with a child's imaginative touch. On the left, depict a blue blob shape for water with an oval representing a fish and a green squiggly line as a plant. On the right, show a flat green area for land with a simple tree consisting of a brown rectangle and a green circle on top. Add a basic round shape with sticks for legs next to the tree to symbolize a land animal. Use bright, simple colors, and include no labels. The style should be elementary and whimsical, reflecting a beginner's understanding of habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to create basic shapes that represent different habitats, though it doesn't include accurate or realistic portrayals. The student can distinguish between water and land but struggles with realistic or diverse depictions of living things in each habitat. The lack of labels and organization aligns with their current understanding, showing effort but also confusion in differentiating and representing different habitats and their inhabitants."
