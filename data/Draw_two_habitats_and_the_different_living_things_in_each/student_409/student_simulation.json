  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw two habitats. I think I'll start with a patch of grass because that's a habitat, right? I'll make it just a big green shape. The other habitat can be water, I guess, like a pond. I'll just draw a blue blob for that. Now, living things. Hmm, I'll draw a few animals. I remember drawing a cat before, so I'll put a cat on the grass because I like cats and see them outside a lot. For the water, I'll draw a fish, because fish live in water. I think a dog could go on the grass too because I've seen dogs in parks. All done, that wasn't so hard!",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two undefined areas, one represented by a simple green patch with two animals: a cartoonish cat and dog, and another area by a blue blob resembling water with a roughly drawn fish. The drawing lacks details, specific habitat features, and clarity, using basic colors: green for grass, blue for water, and mixed colors for the animals.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's minimal understanding, as it describes simple shapes and misplaced animals with no distinct habitats. The student attempted to add living things but chose them without regard to habitat suitability, such as placing land animals on grass and a single fish in water. The drawing is basic, reflecting the student's struggle with specificity and habitat-related patterns, consistent with the student's CANs and CANNOTs."
