  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Correctly identify and draw two distinctly different types of habitats like a forest and a pond (student may struggle to differentiate between land and water habitats).",
    "Accurately draw three different types of living things for each habitat recognized as unique to their environment (student might include fish on land or an ant underwater).",
    "Compare or illustrate the distinctiveness of living things as related to each habitat (student may not show any comparison or signs of understanding unique adaptations).",
    "Represent patterns or organize drawings to highlight diversity or ecological relationships (student's drawings will likely be disorganized without clear grouping or indication of habitat-specific species)."
