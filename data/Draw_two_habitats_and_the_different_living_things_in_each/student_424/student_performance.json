  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label at least one type of habitat, but may not clearly identify both a land and a water habitat.",
    "The student might draw a few living things, such as a tree, fish, or bird, though labels may be missing or incorrect."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly distinguish between a land habitat and a water habitat and might combine elements of both in a single drawing (e.g., drawing fish in a tree).",
    "The student may not include three different types of living things in each habitat and might confuse which types of organisms belong to specific habitats (e.g., putting a dolphin in a forest).",
    "The student may not show differences between the habitats by including specific plants and animals unique to each, possibly drawing the same few living things in both habitats (e.g., the same trees in both land and water environments).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate patterns of diversity and may instead focus on a few repeated elements with little variation.",
    "The drawing might lack organization, with no clear method to display how observations are made or recorded (e.g., clusters of unrelated drawings without clear separation between habitats)."
