  "Reasoning": "Alright, time to draw the two habitats. I'll start with the land habitat. I remember that a forest is a good example. I'll draw some big trees first, because they stand out, and I know squirrels live in trees, so I'll draw a few squirrels on the branches. Let me add some bushes and ants on the ground because they are small and live here too. I should label the squirrels and trees because they are easy to label. Hmm, I might forget to label the ants, but that's okay, I need to move on. Now for the water habitat. A pond sounds good. I'll draw water, then some fish swimming around. They are easy to draw and label. I should also draw some aquatic plants; I'll try to show them floating on the water, like lily pads. I remember to label the fish but might miss labeling the lily pads. Next, a comparison - I’ll try to add more trees in the land habitat and more fish in the water habitat to show the difference. It’s a bit tricky, but I'll do my best. Let’s see how this goes.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child's drawing depicting two different habitats. On the left, draw a forest habitat with large green trees and a few squirrels on the branches. Add bushes and ants on the ground. On the right, depict a pond habitat with blue water, several fish with colorful scales swimming, and some floating green lily pads. The drawing should be colorful, with labels on the squirrels and fish. The style should be that of a proficient 8-year-old, somewhat simple but detailed, with some noticeable effort in differentiating the habitats, despite missing a few labels for less prominent features.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency level. The student successfully draws a land and water habitat, including a mixture of living things like trees, squirrels, fish, and aquatic plants, fulfilling the 'can' capabilities. However, they struggle with consistent labeling and capturing diversity details, such as not labeling ants and lily pads and not emphasizing plant diversity beyond the basic elements, which aligns with the 'cannot' limitations. The color and style suggest a realistic effort for the student's level."
