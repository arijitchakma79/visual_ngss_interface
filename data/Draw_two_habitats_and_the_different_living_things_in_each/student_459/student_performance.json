    "The student might inconsistently label the plants and animals in each habitat, occasionally forgetting to include labels for certain species (e.g., daisies in the garden).",
    "The student may not fully capture fine details or diversity within the same type of organism, like different types of fish or specific tree species.",
    "The student might struggle to highlight patterns in biodiversity clearly, such as not emphasizing which habitat has greater plant diversity *(may not realize importance)*."
