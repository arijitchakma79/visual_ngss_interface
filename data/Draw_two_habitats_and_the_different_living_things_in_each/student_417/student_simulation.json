  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two big boxes on the paper to make space for the different habitats. I think one is supposed to be land and the other water. In the first box, I'm drawing the land. I'll include a tree, since I remember there are trees on land. I want to add animals, too, so I'll draw a lion and maybe a fish, though I’m not too sure where the fish goes. Next, for my water habitat, I'll draw some wavy lines at the bottom to show it's water. I'll add a fish and maybe a dolphin jumping over the waves. I'll also put a tree because it might look good there as well. I’m not sure how to make them look too different, so I’ll put the same tree in both. Sometimes I see fish on TV, so they should probably have a long tail. Alright, looks good to me!",
  "Prompt": "Create a child’s drawing showing two habitats side by side, done in crayon. On the left, there’s a land habitat with a simple tree, a lion, and a fish placed on the grass. On the right is a water habitat, which has a few wavy lines for water, a fish swimming above the waves, a dolphin jumping, and a similar tree to the one in the land habitat. The drawing is colorful but lacks detail and accuracy in habitat elements and animal placement. It mixes elements in both habitats incorrectly.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt accurately reflects the student's understanding and confusion about habitats. The student attempts to depict different habitats but struggles to differentiate them clearly, placing items like fish on land and trees in water. This matches their ability to depict simple scenes but without accurate details or understanding of the differences between environments."
