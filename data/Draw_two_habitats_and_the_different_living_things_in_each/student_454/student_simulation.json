  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different habitats. I’ll start with a garden for a land habitat. I'll draw some grass and a tree with leaves to show it's a garden. I'll also draw a bush with flowers. I remember that squirrels and lizards live here, so I'll add them. Squirrels can go on the tree, and the lizard can be on the ground. Now for the water habitat, I'll draw a pond. I'll start with wavy water lines and some lily pads. I know fish live in ponds, so I'll add some fish swimming. I think I’ll add a forest for the second land habitat. I'll draw more tall trees with lots of green leaves. Maybe a squirrel again, since they’re in forests too. For the second water habitat, how about a stream? I'll draw more water lines flowing in one direction and a larger fish to show it's in water. But I have to be careful not to mix them up. Oops, I almost put a lizard in the water by mistake. I'll label as best as I can, though sometimes I forget. I'll label the tree and bushes in the garden and some trees in the forest. I'll try to label the pond and stream too, but I might miss labeling some fish or lily pads.",
  "Prompt": "A student's drawing with crayon-like texture showing two habitats. On the left, a garden with green grass, a leafy tree, and flowering bushes. There's a squirrel on the tree and a lizard on the ground. Labels include 'Garden', 'Tree', 'Bush', 'Squirrel', and 'Lizard'. On the right, a water habitat showing a pond with blue water and lily pads, with fish swimming, labeled 'Pond' and 'Fish'. Above, a wide habitat including a forest with tall trees and another squirrel. Below, a stream with flowing lines and another larger fish labeled 'Stream'. Some plants and animals are correctly labeled while others are missing labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's skill level, illustrating their ability to distinguish between two habitat types with relevant details. The labeled garden and pond show an understanding of land and water habitats. However, their struggle is reflected in the potential omission or incorrect labeling of some elements, consistent with how the student might incompletely label or mix elements."
