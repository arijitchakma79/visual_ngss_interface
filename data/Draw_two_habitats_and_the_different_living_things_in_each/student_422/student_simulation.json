  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two different habitats. First, I want to make a land habitat, so I'll draw a brown blob; I think that's how I can show land. Maybe I'll make it a little green to show there's something like grass or trees. I remember trees are part of a habitat, so I'll add a simple tree, just a trunk with a cloud-like top. Now, for the water habitat, I'll draw a blue blob next to it. I think fish live in water, so I'll make a fish shape in the blue blob. Maybe just an oval with a tail. I'm not really sure if I'm putting things in the right place, but I want to try. I'll try to label the tree as 'tree' and the fish as 'fish', but I'm a little unsure if I'm doing it right. I feel like there's more I could add, but I'm not sure what other living things go in each blob, and I don't really remember the differences or which animals go where.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child's drawing with two blobs: one brownish-green, and one blue. The brownish-green blob represents land habitat with a simple, basic tree drawn on itâ€”a brown trunk and a green, cloud-like shape on top. The blue blob signifies a water habitat with a very simplistic fish drawn in it: an oval shape with a tail. The drawing includes attempted labels 'tree' and 'fish' near the tree and fish, respectively. The style is naive and basic, with minimal detail and accuracy, using crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it includes basic shapes for the habitats with minimal detail, reflecting a beginning level of understanding. The student draws a tree and a fish, which are recognizable but lack detail or accuracy in their habitats. The attempted labels are present but may not correlate well due to the student's uncertainty, highlighting their struggle with accurate labeling and distinguishing between habitats."
