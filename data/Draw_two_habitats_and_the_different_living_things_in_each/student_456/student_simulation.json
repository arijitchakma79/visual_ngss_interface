  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw two different habitats. First, I'll draw the land habitat. I remember that land habitats usually have trees and bushes, so I'll start with those. I'll draw a couple of big green trees and some smaller bushes. I think squirrels live in trees, so I'll draw a squirrel too. Oh, and maybe a lizard because I think they like warmer places. I know there are more animals I could add, but I'm not sure which ones exactly. Now for the water habitat. I know I should draw a big blue area for water. Fish definitely live in water, so I'll draw a few fish swimming around. I think clams live underwater too, so I'll add a couple of those at the bottom. I feel like there should be some plants, but I'm not really sure what kinds, so I'll put a few green seaweed-like shapes. I can see some things look similar between these habitats, but I’m trying to show what makes them different too. Oh, I need to label these. I'll try, but I'm not sure what all the plants are called, and I might miss some of the animal names.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two distinct habitats side by side in a child-like style with soft colors. On the left, depict a land habitat with two large green trees, a few green bushes, a brown squirrel on one of the tree branches, and a small lizard on the ground. Use colors like green and brown for this habitat. On the right, show an aquatic habitat with a wide blue expanse representing water, several colorful fish swimming, and a couple of clams at the sandy bottom. Include a few green seaweed shapes. Some plants and animals have simple labels, but not all are identified. Ensure some key differences are clear, but a few elements are similar.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency level by including two distinct habitats with visible elements specific to each. It reflects the student's ability to include common living things in each habitat and their attempt to differentiate between the two environments using color and composition. The inclusion of some labeled elements reflects the student's partial ability to identify the species depicted but also includes the stated gap where not all elements are labeled, showing their limitations in vocabulary or specific identification. The prompt and drawing style reflect the student’s level of proficiency with minor gaps."
