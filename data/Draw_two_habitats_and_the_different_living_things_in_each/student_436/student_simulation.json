  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two different habitats, one on land and one in water. I'll start with the land habitat. I remember that habitats can have trees, so I'll draw a big tree in the middle. I should add an animal, so I'll put a squirrel on one of the branches. For the water habitat, I'll draw the water across the bottom half of the page. I know water habitats can have seaweed, so I'll draw some seaweed swaying in the water. I'll add a fish swimming near the seaweed. I want to show that one is land and one is water, so I'll make sure to draw ground under the tree and water for the fish. I don't really know what else goes into these habitats, so I won't add any more plants or animals. I have to remember not to mix them up, like putting a tree in the water. I think it looks like two different habitats now.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two simple habitats, one on land and one in water. In the land habitat, there is a large, basic tree with a small squirrel on a branch. The ground is plain, with little detail. In the water habitat, there are simple lines representing seaweed at the bottom, and a fish swimming nearby. Use basic colors: green for the tree leaves and seaweed, brown for the tree trunk, gray for the squirrel, and blue for the water. The style should be childlike and simplistic, focusing on basic shapes rather than detailed scenery.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's level of understanding by showing the ability to distinguish between land and water habitats with basic elements. The inclusion of a tree and a squirrel for the land habitat and seaweed with a fish for the water habitat aligns with what the student can do. The lack of detailed features and variety reflects the student's struggle with ecosystem diversity and specific terrain characteristics."
