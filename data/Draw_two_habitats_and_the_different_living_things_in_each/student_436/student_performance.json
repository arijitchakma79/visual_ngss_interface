  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two habitats, one on land and one in water, but with limited detail (basic distinctions like ground vs. water without additional features).",
    "The student can include some plants in each habitat, such as a tree for land and seaweed for water, but may not differentiate types clearly.",
    "The student can include a few animals, like a squirrel on land and a fish in water, but may not show much diversity."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to show distinct and detailed features for each habitat, such as specific terrain or water characteristics (e.g., no sandy beaches or rocky areas).",
    "The student does not illustrate a wide variety of living things in each habitat, leading to limited representation of ecosystem diversity (e.g., only one type of plant or animal).",
    "The student may misunderstand plant or animal placement, such as drawing a tree under water or a fish on land (confuses habitat placement)."
