  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a land habitat on the left side of the page. I’ll make sure to include a big deciduous tree with lots of thick green leaves and a couple of smaller bushes around it. I'll also draw some grassy patches. I remember that squirrels climb trees, so I'll draw one on a branch. On the ground, I’ll put a lizard sunbathing on a rock, and maybe a couple of ants crawling nearby. I need to remember to label these. For the water habitat on the right side, I’ll draw a lake with water plants like cattails growing at the edges. I’ll add a fish swimming in the water and some algae. I'll label the fish as a 'trout' because I think specific names are important. Both of these habitats need plants, so I'll show that by drawing different kinds of greenery in each one. I’ll try to point out that there are more plant types in the land habitat. Lastly, I'll label the major elements and try to show how the trees here are different from water plants. I think I’m getting most of the important details, but I might forget to label all the tiny things like the species names for each plant or bug, and I'll have to be careful about the sizes since it could be a bit off when drawing the same size for a lizard and a fish.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene featuring two distinct habitats side by side: a land habitat on the left and a water habitat on the right. For the land habitat, illustrate a large deciduous tree with green leaves, small bushes, and patches of grass. Add a squirrel on a tree branch, a lizard sunbathing on a rock, and ants crawling on the ground. For the water habitat, depict a lake with cattails on the edges, algae on the water surface, and a trout swimming. Use clear labels for the tree, squirrel, lizard, ants, cattails, and trout. Show the similarities by including plant life in both habitats, with more variety on land. Use vibrant colors like green, brown, and blue, and a loose hand-drawn style to emphasize detail and effort.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to identify and draw two distinct habitats, complete with a variety of labeled living things specific to each habitat, showing an advanced understanding level. It acknowledges the student's proficiency in comparing plant life across habitats and illustrating biodiversity, yet it leaves room for minor omissions of details like full species labeling and potential inaccuracies in size representation."
