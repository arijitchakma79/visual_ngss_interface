  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately identify two different habitats, one on land and one in water, in their drawing.",
    "The student can draw and label a variety of living things found in the land habitat, such as trees, grasses, squirrels, and lizards.",
    "The student can draw and label different types of living things found in the water habitat, such as fish and aquatic plants, with specificity (e.g., species names).",
    "The student can demonstrate through their drawings how the living things in each habitat are different but share similarities, such as both having plant life but of different kinds.",
    "The student can illustrate and explicitly label patterns observed in the diversity of plants and animals between the two habitats, like noting adaptations or comparing biodiversity levels."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally miss minor details like labeling every single plant or animal species in the habitats, though this doesn't significantly impact overall understanding.",
    "The student may have slight inaccuracies in representing relative sizes or scales of living things, but these do not impede the core demonstration of concepts."
