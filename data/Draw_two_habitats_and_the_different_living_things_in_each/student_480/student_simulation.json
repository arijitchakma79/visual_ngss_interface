  "Reasoning": "To start, I’ll draw a forest habitat on one side of the page. I know forests have lots of trees, so I’ll draw several different kinds of trees with brown trunks and green, leafy tops. I’ll add some grass near the trees, maybe with a few different shades of green to show variety. Next, I’ll think about the animals that live in the forest. I remember there are birds, so I will draw a couple of colorful birds sitting on the branches. I’ll add a squirrel in one of the trees too, with a bushy tail. Insects are part of the habitat too, so I’ll add a few flying around. Now for the pond habitat on the other side, I’ll draw blue water to represent the pond. Around the pond, I’ll draw water lilies with white and pink flowers. I know fish live in water, so I’ll sketch a few in the pond shaded in orange and silver. I’ll also add a frog on a lily pad. Finally, to show interaction, I’ll draw an arrow from the fish to a small insect flying over the water, indicating they eat them. I think adding more fish and aquatic plants compared to the forests will show the diversity. I’ll try to label every plant and animal, but sometimes I forget one.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed drawing of a forest and pond habitat. On the left, illustrate a forest environment with several trees with brown trunks and green leafy tops. Include green grass at the base. Draw birds in various colors perched on branches, a squirrel with a bushy tail on a tree, and a few insects flying around. On the right, depict a pond with a blue surface. Place water lilies with white and pink hues floating on the pond. Add fish in shades of orange and silver swimming underwater and a frog sitting on a lily pad. Use arrows to show a fish eating an insect hovering near the pond. Use vivid colors for realism and show an abundance of fish and aquatic plants compared to the forest.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities to accurately depict and label two different habitats, each with their plants and animals. The student can use arrows to depict interactions, like a fish eating an insect. It reflects their accuracy and completeness by having abundant detail and colors. The prompt matches the student's potential minor oversight: possible forgetting to label every single element as mentioned in their struggles."
