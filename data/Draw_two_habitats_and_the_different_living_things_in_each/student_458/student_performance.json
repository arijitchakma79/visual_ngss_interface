  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw two distinctly different habitats, including one land habitat like a forest and one water habitat like a pond.",
    "The student can depict various kinds of plants and animals appropriate for each habitat, such as trees and a bird in the forest, and fish and aquatic plants in the pond.",
    "The student can show at least three different living things in each habitat, illustrating diversity such as a squirrel, a butterfly, and a rabbit in the forest.",
    "The student can demonstrate some similarities and differences between the plants and animals in the two habitats, possibly by choosing similar animals like birds but different species that are habitat-specific.",
    "The student can organize their drawings to clearly indicate which plants and animals belong to each habitat, generally grouping them appropriately by habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have minor gaps in representing plant variety, perhaps showing fewer types of plants in the water habitat than in the land habitat (some aquatic plants might be missing or minimal).",
    "The student might inconsistently label or mislabel some living things, such as confusing a frog with a fish or not labeling smaller plants clearly.",
    "The student may not fully explore all similarities and differences between the habitats, focusing more on animal diversity than plant variety or environmental conditions."
