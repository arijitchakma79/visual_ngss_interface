  "Reasoning": "I'll start with the two habitats side by side so they are distinct. On the left, I'll draw a forest. I remember forests have big trees, so I'll draw a few with green canopies. Near one tree, I'll include a squirrel because they live in trees. I'll add a bird on a branch and a rabbit near the ground. To show diversity, I'll also draw a butterfly near some bushes. For the right side, I'll draw a pond as a water habitat. I'll draw fish in the water since ponds usually have fish. I'll sketch some aquatic plants like lily pads, but I'm not sure if I need more kinds. I'll add a frog on a rock by the water. Near the edge of the pond, I'll put a small bird, different from the forest one. I need to label each animal and plant, but sometimes I mix them up, like frogs and fish look similar, so I need to be careful. I notice birds are in both habitats, but they're different species. I'm focusing more on the animals, but I know plants are important too.",
  "Prompt": "A childâ€™s colorful drawing of two distinct habitats. The left side shows a forest with tall trees having green canopies. A squirrel is on one tree, a bird is perched on a branch, a rabbit is on the ground, and a butterfly is near bushes. The right side depicts a pond with fish swimming. Some aquatic plants like lily pads are on the water surface. A frog sits on a rock by the pond. A different bird stands at the pond's edge. The drawing labels each animal and plant but may have minor mislabeling or omissions in aquatic plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by illustrating two different habitats with at least three living things each, showing a range of animals. It reflects the challenge with plant variety in the pond and potential labeling issues, aligning with the student's described proficiency level."
