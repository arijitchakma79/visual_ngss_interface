  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two different habitats. I'll start with a land habitat. I remember that a tree is something that grows on land, so I'll draw a simple outline of a tree. Trees have a round top, so I'll make that part round and just some lines for the trunk. Maybe I should add some grass too, but I'll just draw lots of lines near the bottom because grass is hard to do. Now for the water habitat; water is wavy, so I'll draw some wavy lines to show the water. Hmm, a fish lives in water, so I'll add a plain shape that looks like fish I’ve seen. Let's see, I've put a tree and some grass for land, and a fish for water. I think I'm supposed to add more types of things, but I'm not sure what else goes where. Maybe I’ll just draw another fish in the water since I'm not too sure if animals like frogs or birds go in the water or land.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two habitats side by side, one representing land with a basic tree outline and simple lines for grass, and one representing water with wavy lines and repeated basic fish shapes. The land habitat is drawn with a brown trunk and a green, rounded tree canopy. The water habitat shows blue wavy lines and several fish shapes in light blue. The drawing is in the style of a young child, simple and with few details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to include simple representations of land and water habitats by using a basic tree for land and wavy lines for water, adhering to their understanding. The inclusion of only one type of living thing in each habitat—a fish for water and a tree for land—aligns with their inability to distinguish or diversify the habitats with various living things. The style of the drawing, simplistic and childlike, illustrates the student's introductory level of understanding."
