  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw two different habitats, but they may both look similar or generic (e.g., basic shapes for land and water).",
    "The student can include some living things in each habitat, such as one tree or a fish, but these may not be appropriate or varied."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to consistently distinguish between land and water habitats (e.g., may draw more land elements in the water habitat).",
    "The student cannot show a variety of living things accurately (e.g., using the same plant type for both habitats).",
    "The student has difficulty illustrating different plants in the land habitat, like bushes or flowering plants (e.g., drawing only one type of plant or incorrect plants).",
    "The student struggles to depict different animals specific to land or water habitats (e.g., placing aquatic animals in land habitats).",
    "The student is unlikely to compare living things between habitats effectively (e.g., no visible differences in the types of plants or animals).",
    "The student cannot show patterns in biodiversity clearly (e.g., no clear groupings or categories of plants and animals)."
