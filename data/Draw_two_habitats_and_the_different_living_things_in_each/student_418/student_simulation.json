  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different habitats. I remember that one habitat is land, and the other is water. So, for the land habitat, I'll draw a big tree in the center because that's what I usually see. I think I’ll add some grass because it makes sense to have grass on land. For the water habitat, I'll draw a wavy line to show water. I’ll put a fish in there because fish live in water. Maybe I’ll add a small cloud above the water, though I’m not sure where else to put it. I think I might add the same tree and grass I drew for the land habitat in the water habitat too, because it looks kind of empty without them.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two habitats side by side. The left habitat is land with one large tree in the center and a patch of grass. The right habitat is water, indicated by wavy blue lines, with a single fish swimming in it. There is a repeated tree and grass from the land habitat in the water habitat too. The sky is a bright blue, and there is one small cloud above the water. The drawing is basic, with simple shapes and vibrant colors, done in a childlike style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt illustrates the student's capabilities by showing their ability to attempt drawing two habitats with some effort (e.g., a land habitat with a tree and a water habitat with a fish). However, it also highlights their struggles by including inappropriate or misplaced elements (e.g., the same tree and grass appearing in both habitats, lack of variety in plants or animals). The lack of distinctive features between the habitats reflects their misunderstanding and minimal knowledge on the topic."
