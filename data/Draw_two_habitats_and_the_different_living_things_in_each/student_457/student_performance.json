  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately depict two different habitats, such as one land habitat and one water habitat. (clear distinction between habitats)",
    "The student can include different types of plants found in each habitat, such as trees, grasses, or flowering plants for land habitats and aquatic plants for water habitats. (clearly illustrates at least one type of plant for each habitat)",
    "The student can illustrate different types of animals that live in each habitat, like squirrels or lizards in land habitats and fish or clams in water habitats. (includes at least one animal per habitat)",
    "The student can compare and contrast the diversity of living things between the two habitats by showing at least two different living things in each habitat. (captures basic biodiversity)",
    "The student can observe and represent patterns of biodiversity, showing how different plants and animals exist in various habitats. (identifies that biodiversity varies between the two habitats)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label all plants and animals in the habitats. (some labels might be missing or incorrect)",
    "The student might not fully depict all expected variety and interaction of organisms within each habitat. (e.g., some common species might be omitted)"
