  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats. First, I’ll draw a land habitat on the left side of my paper. I remember land habitats often have trees or grasses, so I’ll draw a big tree with a few smaller bushes and some grass around it. I know there are animals like squirrels and lizards in land habitats, so I’ll try drawing a squirrel on the tree and a lizard on a rock underneath it. Now, for the second habitat, I’ll draw a water habitat on the right side of my paper. I’ll draw a big body of water, like a pond, with some aquatic plants like lily pads. In the water, I’ll draw a fish. I’ll also add a clam at the bottom of the pond. I need to make sure both habitats show at least two different kinds of plants and animals. I think these clearly show the differences between a land and a water habitat. Remembering to label everything is hard, but I’ll label what I can. I might forget or get some labels mixed up, though.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing depicting two distinct habitats side-by-side. On the left, a land habitat with a large green tree, bushes, and grass. A brown squirrel is perched on the tree, and a green lizard is on a gray rock. On the right, a water habitat featuring a blue pond with green lily pads. A fish swims in the water, and a clam rests at the bottom. The style is childish and colorful, illustrating biodiversity in simple, clear shapes. Some labels are present, but not everything is labeled.",
  "Explanation": "The drawing includes a clear depiction of two distinct habitats—a land habitat and a water habitat—highlighting the biodiversity in each with different plants and animals. While the student successfully captures basic biodiversity and clearly distinguishes between habitats, their struggle to label accurately is depicted by not all elements having labels, fulfilling what the student cannot do according to their skill level description."
