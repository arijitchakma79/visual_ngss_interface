  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the land habitat. I remember that an oak tree is a great example of something found in these environments, so I’ll start there. I'll put the oak tree slightly to the left side of my drawing to leave room for other living things. Next, I'll draw a few squirrels on the branches because they love to climb trees. I’ll add a robin perched on one of the branches too. Let's also put some daisies and wildflowers on the ground to show the variety of plants. I want to make sure I label everything so it's clear which is which. Now, I'll move on to the aquatic habitat. I want to make it distinct from the land one, so I'll start by drawing water across the bottom half of the page. For the aquatic life, I’ll draw a trout swimming mid-water and some water lilies floating on the surface. I know frogs like to stay near the water, so I'll add one sitting on a lily pad. I'll also sketch some clams on the bottom of the waterbed, and there should be algae too, so I'll include some around the clams. I’ll label all these to show the different living things. I’ll make sure to keep my land and aquatic habitats separate to show the patterns in biodiversity.",
  "Prompt": "A student's drawing showing two distinct habitats: On the top half, a land habitat with a large oak tree on the left, squirrels on the branches, a robin perched on a branch, and the ground scattered with daisies and wildflowers. On the bottom half, an aquatic habitat with water covering it. In the water, a trout is swimming, water lilies and a frog are on the surface, and clams and algae are on the waterbed. Each living thing is clearly labeled. The drawing is colorful, with rich greens for the land plants, red and gray for the robin and squirrels, yellow and white for daisies, and blue for the water, mimicking colored pencil style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the 'can' descriptors by incorporating a variety of living things specific to each habitat and making the distinct environments clear, using labels effectively. It also avoids 'cannot' aspects by ensuring all living things are labeled and no attempt at conveying advanced concepts like symbiotic relationships is made, focusing instead on fundamental elements of each habitat."
