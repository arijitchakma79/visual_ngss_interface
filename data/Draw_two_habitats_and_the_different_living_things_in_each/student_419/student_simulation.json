  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by dividing the paper in half so I have two sides. One side can be the forest, and the other side could be the ocean. But I’m not sure if they look very different. I’ll draw some squiggly lines on both sides to be... trees, I think? On the ocean side too, though I’m not sure if trees are in the ocean. I’ll add some circles or blobs on both sides because I know living things are there. Maybe that’s a bird in the forest and a fish in the ocean? I can’t really tell. I forgot to label them, and I don’t have two different things in each place, just whatever I drew. Forests have lots of trees, but I only drew some squiggles here. I think the ocean has fish, but I’m not sure. I’ll add a few more random shapes. Did I make the habitats different enough? They look kind of the same to me.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing that shows two side-by-side undefined areas, loosely representing separate habitats. On the left, a few vague squiggly lines and circles representing trees and animals, without specific detail or accuracy. On the right, similar shapes and squiggles that are meant to depict aquatic life, but lacking distinction from the left. Both sides show minimal detail and have a mix of color scribbles—greens, browns, blues—but without clear separation or accurate representation. The drawing lacks labels and any obvious diversity of plant and animal life.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two separate areas but fails to clearly differentiate between habitats like land and water. The hazy shapes and indistinct lines indicate the student's efforts to depict living things but their lack of understanding shows in the non-distinctive representations and absence of labeling. The drawing has a variety of colors and basic shapes, showing the student's attempt, but ultimately does not display diversity or clear comparison between the habitats."
