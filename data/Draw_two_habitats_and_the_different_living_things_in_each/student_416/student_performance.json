    "The student cannot accurately compare or label the different types of living things in each habitat, missing labels or using incorrect names for organisms *(e.g., calling a fish a squirrel)*.",
    "The student does not identify patterns in plant and animal diversity across habitats, showing no distinction or pattern in living things *(e.g., placing all creatures in a random order)*."
