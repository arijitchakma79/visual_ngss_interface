  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two habitats and the different living things in each. I know one habitat can be land and another water. I’ll start by drawing a big circle for land, like a playground. I can add a tree because I remember trees grow on land. I'll draw just one tree. It looks a bit lonely, so I'll try adding another shape that might be an animal. I'll draw some circles and lines; maybe it's a bird or something. Now, I'll draw the water habitat. I know it's different from land because fish are in water. I’ll draw a circle here too. For the fish, I'll draw a blob with a tail. Oops, I also put a tree next to the fish by mistake. I'm not sure what else goes in the water habitat. Both habitats have about the same things, like my circles. I know they should look different, but I'm more focused on drawing my circles and shapes now.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child's drawing of two habitats showing land and water. The land is a simple circle containing one tree and several indistinct shapes representing potential animals. The water is another circle with a fish-like shape but also mistakenly contains a tree. Use bright colors like green and blue and a very basic, childish drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities by including basic shapes, like circles for the habitats, which are simple and consistent with the student's limited understanding. There's a tree on both land and water, demonstrating the student's confusion about distinct habitats. Living things are represented by nonspecific, repeated shapes, showing minimal animal diversity and inaccurate positions, aligning with the student's tendency to misplace or misunderstand environment-specific features."
