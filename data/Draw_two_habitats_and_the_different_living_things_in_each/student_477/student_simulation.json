  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start by drawing the forest habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I’ll draw different types of trees like tall pine trees and broad oak trees. I should add some animals I’ve learned are common in forests, like squirrels, some birds flying between the trees, and maybe a deer or two. I’ll also include some insects like butterflies and ants on the ground. Next, I’ll move on to the ocean habitat. I know there should be water all around, and I will draw waves at the top. I’ll include various ocean animals like different kinds of fish, perhaps a crab on the ocean floor, and maybe an octopus. I should remember to add seaweed to show some plant life in the ocean. I will label the habitats, and make sure I write down the names of the plants and animals next to what I’ve drawn. I might accidentally label something incorrectly or draw something not typical for the habitat, like a tropical fish that doesn't fit the ocean type I meant to show, but I’ll do my best to get it right.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two distinct habitats: A vibrant forest on the left with diverse plants and animals, featuring tall trees like pines and oaks, squirrels, birds, deer, butterflies, and ants. The forest is in lush greens and browns, with animals in natural positions. On the right, an ocean habitat with rolling blue waves, containing various fish, a crab, an octopus, and seaweed waving in the water. Both habitats have labels for plants and animals in clear handwriting. Drawing style is detailed and colorful, with realistic proportions reflecting an advanced understanding of both habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures student capabilities by focusing on accurate representation of two distinct habitats, each carefully populated with appropriate and diverse living things in alignment with their detailed observations. It reflects their understanding by including a variety of flora and fauna, labeled for clarity, satisfying the advanced level of detail expected. It also acknowledges possible misunderstandings where labels might be wrong or a species slightly out of place, as per the 'cannot' description."
