  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a simple outline of a land habitat, such as a basic playground or a rudimentary garden, with some recognizable features.",
    "The student can attempt a basic illustration of a water habitat like a pond or stream, though it might be less detailed.",
    "The student can sketch a few types of plants in each habitat, such as a simple tree or a flower.",
    "The student can include some animals, possibly a common one like a squirrel in the land habitat or a fish in the water habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to show complex or specific details in either habitat, such as the exact types of plants or animals specific to those environments (e.g., confusing a bush for a type of grass).",
    "The student has difficulty comparing the diversity of living things between the two habitats and does not clearly indicate any patterns (e.g., may place same animals in both habitats without distinction).",
    "The student may mix plants and animals incorrectly between habitats, such as placing land animals in water habitats *(student misunderstands habitat-specific species)*.",
    "The drawings may not clearly organize or separate the plants and animals specific to each habitat, leading to confusion in intended illustration purpose *(student lacks organization in demonstrating the concept)*."
