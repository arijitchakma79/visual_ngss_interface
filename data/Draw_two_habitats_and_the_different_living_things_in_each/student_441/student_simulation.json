  "Reasoning": "I’m going to start by drawing a land habitat. I remember my playground, so I’ll draw that. I’ll make a simple rectangle for the ground, and I’ll put a big tree because there’s always a tree in parks. A squirrel could live there, so I’ll draw a small animal, maybe an oval with a bushy tail. Now, for the water habitat, I’ll try a pond. I’ll draw an oval shape for the pond and a skinny tree next to it. I remember ponds have fish, so I’ll draw a basic fish shape - like an oval with a triangle for a tail. I should add some plants – maybe a flower in the playground and a single grass-like plant near the pond. I might mix up what goes where; I’ll try my best, but I worry I’ll put the wrong thing in the wrong place like a fish near the tree. I can’t think of any complex details like the exact types of trees or which specific fish it is. I’ll try coloring them, maybe green for plants and blue for the pond water.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like illustration. On the left, show a land habitat with a large tree, a basic outline of a playground with a squirrel, and a small flower. Use greens and browns. On the right, depict a water habitat with a simple pond shape, a single fish hovering above it, and a thin tree close by. Use blues for the pond and hint at some green for the reeds. Do not focus on intricate details, keeping the style rudimentary and somewhat mixed up between habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to draw basic features and common animals or plants but struggles with specificity and organization. The focus is on capturing a simple representation of land and water habitats without complicating features, evident from both mixing and misplacement of species. The use of colors and lack of complex detailing aligns with the level description of 'Developing'."
