  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the land habitat on the left side of my paper. I remember that in a land habitat there are usually trees, grass, and some bushes. I'll start by drawing a big tree, and since I know that squirrels live in trees, I'll draw a squirrel on one of the branches. I'll add some grass at the bottom and a bush beside the tree. Now, I should include another animal; I'll draw a lizard on the ground because I know they like sunny places. Next, I'll draw the water habitat on the right side of my paper. I need to include fish and water plants in this part. I'll draw a pond and a couple of fish swimming. I'll add some wavy lines to show the water. For plants, I'll draw some water lilies on the surface. I'll make sure to label the squirrel, tree, and fish, though I might forget to label all of them, like maybe forgetting what a lizard is called. I hope I've included enough variety in both habitats to show the differences. It's tough to remember everything, and I have to make sure not to mix up any labels.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing two distinct habitats on the same page. On the left, a land habitat with a large green tree, a squirrel on a branch, grass, and a lizard on the ground beside a bush. The tree, squirrel, and grass are labeled. On the right, a water habitat with a blue pond, two fish swimming, and water lilies on the pond's surface. The fish are labeled. The drawing is colorful and made with colored pencils with clear labels, though not all organisms are labeled. The style is childlike and moderately detailed.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a distinct land and water habitat with clear characteristics. The student successfully draws essential elements like trees and squirrels in the land habitat and fish and plants in the water habitat, demonstrating understanding. While the labels for most key organisms are present, some may be forgotten due to the student's struggle with consistent labeling. Additionally, the variety in living things is limited in accordance with the level of proficiency described, showing the student's challenge in fully capturing the diversity of each habitat."
