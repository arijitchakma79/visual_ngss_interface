  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can successfully draw one land habitat and one water habitat, with distinct characteristics for each.",
    "The student can include a variety of living things in the land habitat, such as trees, grasses, bushes, and at least one animal like a lizard or squirrel.",
    "The student can include several types of living things in the water habitat, like fish and water plants.",
    "The student can provide labels for most of the living things in each habitat to demonstrate their understanding of the diversity present."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently show a wide variety of plants and animals in both habitats, potentially leaving out some expected examples (e.g., only includes one type of animal in each habitat).",
    "The student might inaccurately label a few organisms or leave out labels for some entirely, causing partial misinterpretation of the drawing (e.g., mislabeling a clam as a fish).",
    "The student could struggle to clearly show nuances in the diversity of land vs. water habitats, leading to minor gaps in comparison (e.g., fewer differences highlighted between the two habitats)."
