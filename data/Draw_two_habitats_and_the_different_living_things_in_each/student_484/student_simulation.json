  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a land habitat. I know a forest is a perfect example, so I'll draw tall trees with branches and leaves. I'll also add some grasses and label them. Birds should be flying or sitting in the trees, and I’ll draw a few squirrels on the branches or ground. I remember that it's important to label each living thing, so I'll clearly label 'tree,' 'bird,' 'squirrel,' and 'grass.' Now, onto the water habitat. A pond seems suitable, so I’ll draw some fish swimming, and aquatic plants like reeds growing around it. I’ll add some insects on the water surface too. These aquatic plants and fish need clear labels, so I don't forget. Comparing these, I see that the forest has more trees and animals like birds and squirrels, while the pond has fish and aquatic insects. I should make sure to organize everything so it’s easy to see the differences. Sometimes I might forget a label, or not draw an insect as clearly, but I'll check to avoid that.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed and labeled pencil drawing of two habitats. On the left, a land habitat: a forest with tall green trees, labeled 'tree,' green grasses labeled 'grass,' colorful birds labeled 'bird,' and brown squirrels labeled 'squirrel.' On the right, a water habitat: a pond with clear water and brown reeds labeled 'aquatic plants,' fish swimming beneath the water labeled 'fish,' and small insects hovering over the surface labeled 'insects.' Both habitats include vibrant colors to differentiate each living thing, with each species accurately represented. The layout is clear, emphasizing diversity and allowing easy comparison.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by emphasizing detailed and labeled illustrations of the habitats and living things. The student shows a strong understanding of the habitats and can depict and label them accurately with minor exceptions, such as occasionally missing a label or simplifying background elements. This prompt captures their capability to compare habitats and ensure information is organized, reflecting both their strengths and their minor challenges."
