  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats: a garden for the land habitat and a pond for the water habitat. I remember that a garden can have trees, grasses, lizards, and squirrels. So, I'll draw a big tree with green leaves on one side and some grass patches around it. I’ll add a cute little squirrel on the tree branch and a lizard on a rock nearby. Now, moving to the pond habitat, I'll draw the water with blue and some ripples. I’ll put a fish, which I know should have fins and a tail, swimming under the water. There's room for aquatic plants, so I'll draw some with long green leaves. Maybe a clam on the pond bottom too, because I read they live there. I know I need to show differences, so I'll make sure the plants look different in both habitats. I might forget to label something specific like the species of the tree, but I'll try my best to cover most details. This part excites me as it makes my drawing look alive! I don't need to worry about tiny plants or microbes since it's not a big deal if they don't show up.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two distinct habitats. On the left, depict a land habitat resembling a garden, with a large leafy green tree, patches of grass, a squirrel on the tree branch, and a lizard on a nearby rock. Use earthy colors for the ground. On the right, show a water habitat like a pond, with blue water and gentle ripples. Include a fish swimming below the surface, tall green aquatic plants, and a clam at the bottom. Ensure that the land and water habitats show clear differentiation in plant and animal life. Use a colorful and detailed, child-like artistic style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately represent both habitats and their distinguishing features. Inclusion of trees, grasses, and specific animals like squirrels and lizards in the garden shows capability in land habitat depiction, while the pond's fish, aquatic plants, and clam reflect their skill with water habitats. Minor gaps, such as lacking specific species labels, reflect what the student might overlook but are minor in impact. The colorful, detailed style matches the advanced level of representation the student is capable of, with an emphasis on clear differentiation between the habitats."
