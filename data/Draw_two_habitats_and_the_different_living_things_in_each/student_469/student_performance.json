  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw distinct habitats, such as a forest and a pond, with noticeable features to differentiate them.",
    "The student can include diverse plants and animals in each habitat, like trees, shrubs, birds, and squirrels in the forest; aquatic plants and fish in the pond.",
    "The student can show reasonable placement of plants and animals within each habitat that makes sense (e.g., fish in the water, birds on trees).",
    "The student can label some aspects correctly, like naming common animals and plants in each habitat.",
    "The student can attempt to illustrate patterns, such as showing or labeling why certain animals live in a specific habitat (e.g., fish need water)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully illustrate or label all diverse elements in each habitat, potentially omitting less common species (e.g., insects like dragonflies might not be shown or labeled).",
    "The student might confuse some habitat elements, occasionally misplacing certain animals (e.g., placing a land mammal like a rabbit in the pond instead of on land).",
    "The student may inconsistently label features or elements, sometimes leaving out labels due to forgetfulness or misunderstanding (e.g., not labeling the pond or forest clearly).",
    "The student might not completely explain the patterns in why certain species live in each habitat, lacking detailed descriptions or reasoning (e.g., just showing fish in water without explaining why they need it)."
