  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two habitats: a forest on the left and a pond on the right. For the forest, I’ll draw some big trees and some bushes. I know that birds live in trees, so I’ll draw a bird sitting on a branch. I’ll also add a squirrel climbing one of the trees because that’s what I’ve seen in pictures. For the pond, I’ll draw the water with some fish inside it, making sure they look like they are swimming. I’ll add a few aquatic plants in the water, like lily pads, because I remember seeing those in ponds. I know frogs live near water, so I’ll draw a frog sitting on a lily pad. I should label some of these so it’s clear what they are. I’ll write 'forest' above the trees and 'pond' by the water. I’ll try to label the bird, squirrel, fish, and frog but sometimes I forget these things, or maybe I’m not sure if I’m spelling them right. I’ll make sure that the fish are in the water and remember that birds should be on trees. I might accidentally put a rabbit near the water because they like eating plants, but I’ll try to avoid putting it in the pond. I’ll try showing that fish need water but might forget to write why. I think it’s done but might have left out some tiny animals like insects because they’re easy to miss.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split scene. On the left, illustrate a bright green forest with tall trees and shrubs. Include a bird on a tree branch and a brown squirrel climbing one of the trees. Label the area as 'forest'. On the right side, show a blue pond with fish swimming in the water and lily pads floating. Place a green frog on a lily pad. Label this side as 'pond'. Add color to the plants and animals, keeping the style simple and child-like, with some labels missing or inconsistent. Avoid intricate details, showing basic but clear distinctions between the forest and pond habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by having clear and distinct habitats with correctly placed animals. It reflects their level by ensuring some elements are labeled correctly, like ‘forest’ and ‘pond’, while missing other details. Simple patterns and correct placements are shown, like fish in the water. The student’s challenge is represented by the possibility of omitting less common species, not labeling everything, and not fully explaining why certain animals are in specific habitats."
