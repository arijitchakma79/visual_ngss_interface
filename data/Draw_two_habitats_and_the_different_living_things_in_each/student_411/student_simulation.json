  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm supposed to draw two habitats. I'll start with a land habitat. I remember that there are trees in forests, so I'll draw a big tree in the middle. Maybe there's some grass around it. I don't really remember what else goes in a land habitat, but I think there can be a bunny under the tree. Now for the second habitat, it has to be different, right? Water is different, so Iâ€™ll make this one with water. I'll use blue to show the water, and maybe draw some waves. I think fish live in water, so I'll draw a big fish. I know there are other things in these places, but I can't really think of anything else to add. Both my habitats have animals and something from nature, so I think I'm done.",
  "Prompt": "A simple crayon drawing by a child featuring two habitats: On the left, a land habitat with a large green tree at the center, surrounded by patches of green grass and a simplistic bunny drawn underneath the tree. On the right, a water habitat represented by a wavy blue patch to indicate water and a single, large outlined fish swimming in it. The drawing is colorful but lacks detailed elements or additional animals, maintaining a straightforward and basic style.",
  "Explaination": "The student's drawing includes an attempt to create a land habitat with a prominent tree and some grass, and a single, simplistic bunny which aligns with their capability to only include a basic habitat representation. The water habitat is indicated with blue waves and a basic fish, showing effort but lacking detail or diversity. There are no significant differences in the complexity or content between the two habitats, reflecting the student's struggle to depict varied living things or differences between the environments."
