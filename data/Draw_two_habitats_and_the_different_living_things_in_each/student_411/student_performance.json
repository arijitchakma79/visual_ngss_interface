  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a basic land habitat, perhaps including one prominent feature like a tree, but may not accurately depict other living things expected in the habitat.",
    "The student may start drawing a second habitat, potentially indicating water by using blue color or drawing waves, but the representation may lack clarity or detail."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to include or depict multiple living things accurately, such as squirrels or fish, potentially drawing unrelated or unrealistic items (e.g., a random animal not typically found in that habitat).",
    "The student does not show significant differences between the two habitats, possibly drawing similar features for both or failing to distinguish between them (e.g., drawing the same animals in both habitats).",
    "The student is unable to illustrate or identify the patterns of plant and animal diversity (student may not understand what diversity means or looks like in this context).",
    "The drawing might lack any meaningful comparison or explanatory elements, as the student is not yet able to differentiate interactions in land vs. water environments (student doesnâ€™t know how habitats differ in function or appearance)."
