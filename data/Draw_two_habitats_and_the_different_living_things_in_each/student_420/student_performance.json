  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,

  "CAN": [
    "Attempt to draw a single type of habitat. The student may draw a simple land environment with minimal details, such as a patch of grass or a single tree.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Identify and illustrate two different types of habitats (one land and one water). The student might show only one habitat or confuse the types, such as adding a fish in a forest environment.",
    "Illustrate a variety of living things found in each habitat. The student may repeat living things across habitats or fail to distinctively show different organisms.",
    "Visually compare the diversity of plants and animals between the two habitats. There may be no obvious differences or similarities shown in the studentâ€™s drawings.",
    "Demonstrate patterns of plant and animal diversity across the two habitats. The drawings may lack organization or fail to highlight any patterns. Expect random placement and grouping.",
    "Clearly label their drawings. The student might not include labels or might label incorrectly due to limited understanding."
