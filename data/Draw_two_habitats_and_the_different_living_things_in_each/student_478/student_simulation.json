  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two habitats, one on land and one in water. First, I'll draw a forest since it's a common land habitat with lots of trees like oaks and pines. I'll add a deer, a squirrel, and some mushrooms near the base of the trees because these are living things found in a forest. I should remember to label each of them. Next, I'll draw an ocean habitat. I'll include a coral reef, which will have bright colors with corals, fish like clownfish, and some seaweed. I should label these as well. Now, I need to make sure the forest and ocean look distinct. The forest will have lots of green and brown, and I'll add some pine needles on the ground. The ocean habitat will have blue water and a sandy seabed. I can also add a dolphin and some bubbles. I'll make sure to label everything, but I might forget a small plant or two, especially in the ocean habitat where there are so many details. Overall, my drawing should show different living things in each environment, clearly labeled, with each habitat's unique patterns.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed picture featuring two separate habitats: a lush green forest on the left, with trees like oaks and pines. Include a deer, squirrel, and mushrooms, all appropriately labeled. On the right, illustrate an underwater ocean scene with a vibrant coral reef. Include colorful corals, a clownfish, seaweed, and a dolphin, ensuring each is labeled. The forest should have green and brown tones, while the ocean habitat should have blue and sandy colors. Label all elements clearly but note a minor omission of some smaller plants in the ocean habitat. Present the drawing with a realistic and clear style using colored pencils, focusing on the distinct features and organisms of each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's mastery by including two fully detailed habitats with appropriate plants and animals, reflecting their ability to depict distinct environments. Labels are included for all major features, showcasing the student's strength in organization and clarity. Minor omissions are acknowledged by mentioning that some small ocean plants might not be labeled, addressing a potential oversight consistent with what the student might miss at their level."
