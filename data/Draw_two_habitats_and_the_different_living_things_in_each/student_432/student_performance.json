  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the basic outline of two habitats, such as a land area with simple trees or shrubs, and a water area with waves or water symbols.",
    "The student can label some living things, like a tree or fish, but may only identify a few correct examples, such as squirrels or fish."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely to omit or incorrectly label more complex living things, like clams or water plants (student may not recognize these as distinct living things).",
    "The student may not effectively compare plant and animal diversity across habitats, possibly drawing similar animals in both without distinction (student may think all animals can live in all habitats).",
    "The drawing might lack clear patterns showing plant and animal diversity or the labeling might be inconsistent and incomplete (student has emerging but incomplete understanding)."
