  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two different places that animals and plants live in. I remember from class that habitats can be on land or in the water. So, I'll start with a land area. I'll draw some trees and maybe a bush or two because I know trees are living things and animals live there. Next, I'll try drawing a water habitat. I think I should draw some wavy lines to show water because that's where fish live. I'll label a tree next to the land habitat. I might add a squirrel because they live in trees, but I'm not sure if there's anything else I can add there. I'll label a fish in the water, since I know fish live in water. I might add another fish even though it's the same as the first one. I know there are more living things, but I'm not sure what else lives in the water or what other animals live in the trees besides squirrels.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple landscape split into two sections. On the left, a basic land habitat with simple green trees and a small bush. Include a tree and a squirrel labeled. On the right, a water habitat with wavy blue lines indicating water. Add two fish, both labeled 'fish'. Use bright colors and a simple, childlike drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw simple representations of two habitats with basic examples of living things. The land habitat includes a tree and squirrel, which are correctly labeled items the student can identify. The water habitat has a couple of fish, correctly labeled, displaying the student's recognition of fish as living in water. The student fails to show more diverse or complex life forms or differentiate their environments comprehensively, aligning with what the student 'cannot' do in their current understanding."
