  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two habitats. Let's start with the land habitat. I think I'll draw a big tree because trees are important for animals to live in. Next, I'll draw some grass around it and maybe some flowers. For animals, I know squirrels live in trees, so I'll draw a squirrel. Oh, maybe a bird too, because they live in trees as well. Now for the water habitat, I'm thinking of the ocean. I'll draw some waves to show the water. Fish definitely live in the water, so I'll draw a fish. I can add some seaweed and maybe a crab on the sand. I feel like I should separate the animals, but I might make a mistake. I hope I put everything in the right place. I remember a fish can't live on land, but maybe it's okay if my drawing isn't perfect. I don't think I need to label everything because I've already drawn the animals where they should be.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a simple tree with green leaves and a squirrel and a bird. The ground has a few patches of grass and colorful flowers. On the right, an ocean habitat with blue waves and a fish swimming. Below the waves, there's green seaweed and a crab on the sand. The drawing is colorful, with basic shapes and some mix-ups, like a bird close to the water. The style should be simplistic and childlike, using bright colors like green, blue, brown, and yellow.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do: drawing basic land and water habitats with familiar animals and some plants. It also reflects their struggles by potentially placing some species close to or in incorrect environments, such as a bird near the water, highlighting their difficulty in distinguishing species-specific habitats. The drawing style reflects their developmental level, showing recognizable but basic elements without labels."
