  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two different habitats, typically one resembling land (e.g., a basic tree or piece of playground equipment) and one containing water, although details may be limited.",
    "The student can include some plants in one or both habitats, likely focusing on more recognizable types like trees or flowers.",
    "The student can include some animals in the drawings, generally focusing on familiar ones like squirrels or fish, but may not be a diverse set."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show a clear distinction between all the plants and animals unique to each habitat, possibly mixing species that belong exclusively in one environment (e.g., drawing a fish on land).",
    "The student might struggle with showing meaningful comparisons between the plants and animals in the two habitats, possibly overlooking labels or relevant illustrations (e.g., drawing without labels or mismatched plant-animal pairing).",
    "The student may not effectively demonstrate the concept of biodiversity and might not depict how different living things are ideally suited for their respective habitats (e.g., placing non-aquatic plants in a water setting)."
