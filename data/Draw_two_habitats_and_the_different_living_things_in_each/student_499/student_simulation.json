  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the two different habitats. I think I'll start with a forest because I know a lot about the things that live there. I'll include some tall trees with green leaves and a grassy ground. I'll make sure to draw some animals like birds in the trees, and maybe a squirrel with its bushy tail. On the ground, I'll add some small plants and maybe a lizard because I remember lizards like to sun themselves on rocks. I also know a pond would be a good aquatic habitat. I'll draw it with some blue water and put a fish in it. I'll add some water plants like lily pads and maybe a frog on one of them. I’ll also include a turtle since they love ponds. I need to make sure each habitat looks distinct, so I'll use different colors for each one. For the labels, I'll write 'forest' and 'pond' to clearly show the difference. I'll try to label most of the living things, like 'tree', 'bird', 'fish', and 'frog'. Sometimes I forget to label everything, but I'll try my best not to miss any major details. I won't name every specific plant species, but I'll capture the diversity in each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful illustration featuring two distinct natural habitats side by side. On the left, depict a forest with tall green trees, a grassy floor, and some small plants. Add animals like birds in the trees, a squirrel on a branch, and a lizard on a stone, with clear, simple labels. On the right, draw a pond with blue water, lily pads, a frog sitting on one, a fish visible under the water, and a turtle on the water’s edge. Use bold, bright colors and a child-like drawing style, with labeled elements to indicate diversity in each habitat.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw two distinct habitats and populate them with various living things, indicating an understanding of diverse ecosystems. It reflects the student's competence in using labeling to show differentiation, though it acknowledges their occasional tendency to use more general terms instead of specific species names. The prompt ensures that the forest and pond are easily distinguishable, and it uses color and style appropriate for an advanced elementary-level task, focusing on effort rather than perfection in detail."
