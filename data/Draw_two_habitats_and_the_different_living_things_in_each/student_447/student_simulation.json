  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two big sections on my paper for different habitats. On the left side, I'll make a forest because I know forests have lots of trees. I'll start by drawing a few tall trees with green leaves, maybe a bush, and some simple lines for grass. I remember I can add a bird in one of the trees and maybe a squirrel on one of the branches because those animals live in forests. Now for the right side, Iâ€™m going to draw a water habitat. I'll make waves to show the ocean and use a blue crayon for the water. I'll draw fish swimming and maybe a big whale because I know they live in the ocean. I have to remember to make a few plants like seaweed, but I might forget to add different types of ocean plants. I'm trying to make both sides different, but I find it hard to think of more plants or animals for each place, and I'm not sure how to make the animals look very different. I might mix up where some animals go or forget to label things properly, so someone might not tell which habitat is which.",
  "Prompt": "Draw an image showing two habitats side by side: on the left, a simple forest with a few green trees, a bush, and lines for grass. Add a bird in the trees and a squirrel on a branch. On the right, depict an ocean scene with blue waves, some fish, and a large whale. Include a few strands of seaweed. Use a childlike, simple style with basic shapes and bright colors. Make sure the drawing reflects an emerging understanding with limited variety and detail in each habitat.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by focusing on basic elements like trees, an ocean wave, and a few well-known animals. It aligns with their level by maintaining a simple depiction of each habitat, with limited variety and clear but not detailed differences. It also incorporates struggles by not having a wide diversity of plants and animals and leaves room for possible confusion or lack of detail as described in the student's constraints."
