  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and draw two different habitats, but the representations may be simplistic or lack detail (e.g., basic outline of a forest and ocean).",
    "The student can illustrate a few types of plants and animals in each habitat, such as a tree in the land habitat and a fish in the water habitat, though the variety might be limited."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show a comprehensive variety of living things in each habitat; they may repeat similar plants or animals without showing diversity (e.g., several trees instead of including grass or bushes).",
    "The student may not effectively use patterns to illustrate diversity or might not include enough detail to show clear differences between habitats (e.g., animals in each habitat may look similar or be inaccurately placed, such as a land animal in a water setting).",
    "The student might not organize the drawing to clearly communicate differences between the two habitats, leading to potential confusion about where specific living things belong (e.g., mixing up habitat types or mislabeling them)."
