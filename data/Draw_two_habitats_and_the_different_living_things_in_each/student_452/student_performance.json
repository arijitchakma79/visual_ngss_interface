    "The student can show some differences in plant diversity between the two habitats, like deciduous trees in the forest versus reeds in the pond.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to accurately show the full diversity of both habitats, possibly omitting less obvious organisms like insects or microorganisms (student may not have a complete understanding of ecosystem diversity).",
    "The student might inconsistently label or identify the species correctly, such as labeling a squirrel as a rabbit (minor mislabeling of organisms)."
