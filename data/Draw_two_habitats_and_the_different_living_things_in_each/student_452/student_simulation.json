  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats. First, I’ll draw a forest because I know a lot about forests. I’ll include big trees, maybe some oak and pine trees, and some bushes and grasses on the ground. I remember that forests have animals like squirrels, lizards, and maybe some birds. I know I should add those next. On the other side, I’ll draw a pond as the aquatic habitat. Here, I’ll draw water with reeds and some lily pads. I know ponds have fish, so I’ll draw a couple of them in the water. I also think there are frogs on the edge, so I’ll put one there too. I’m not sure about smaller creatures like insects or bacteria in the pond, so I might leave those out. I’ll use different labels to try and name the animals, but I have to be careful I don’t mix them up. Squirrels and rabbits look kind of similar, so I hope I get the labels right.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing two separate habitats. On the left, depict a forest with tall oak and pine trees, bushes, and grasses. Include a few animals such as squirrels, lizards, and birds in the forest. On the right, draw a pond with blue water, green reeds, floating lily pads, and fish in the water. Add a frog sitting on the edge of the pond. Use bright and clear colors with a simple, child-like drawing style to reflect the student’s understanding. Some animals might have incorrect labels, such as a squirrel being labeled as a rabbit.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s ability to depict two distinct habitats and include different living organisms, such as trees, grasses, fish, and frogs, accurately capturing the more common elements of each environment. It also shows the student's struggle to represent the full diversity, omitting smaller organisms, and the potential for minor labeling errors. The colors and style suggested match the student's proficiency level, showing effort and understanding while also indicating some limitations."
