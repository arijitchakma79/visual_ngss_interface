  "Reasoning": "I'm going to start with the land habitat. I remember that forests have a lot of trees, so I’ll draw some big, tall trees with green leaves. I’ll also add some grass on the ground. Since squirrels live in trees, I’ll make sure to draw a few squirrels. Next, I'll move on to the water habitat. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a few fish swimming around. I’ll include some aquatic plants; they also grow in water. I can draw clams at the bottom since they like to stay there. Now I’ll add labels to everything. I’ll write \"tree\" next to the trees, \"squirrel\" by the squirrels, and so on. I might forget to label something like a common plant or use 'animal' instead of 'aquatic animal' sometimes. Lastly, I’ll look to see if I've drawn at least a few different plants and animals in each habitat to show how they are specific to the habitat. I hope I didn’t miss any labels.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two distinct habitats: a forest and a water-based habitat. On the left side, depict a forest with tall green trees and patches of grass. Include small squirrels on the trees. On the right side, create an underwater scene with several fish of different colors swimming and clams situated at the bottom. Include swaying green aquatic plants in the water. The drawing should be colorful and in a hand-drawn, childlike art style. Some elements such as trees, squirrels, fish, and aquatic plants should be clearly labeled, though a few labels are missing or use less specific terms like 'animal'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's abilities: they can illustrate two different habitats with appropriate plants and animals, label most of them, and show the specificity of living things to their environments. However, it also highlights their struggle with inconsistently labeling elements or using general terms, aligning with the 'CANNOT' factors."
