  "Reasoning": "I’ll start drawing a land habitat first. I remember there are trees on land, so I’ll draw a big tree with green leaves. I'll also add a squirrel on the tree because I’ve seen squirrels live in trees. Now, I should draw a water habitat. Water has some plants too, like algae, so I’ll put some algae in the water. I’ll draw a fish swimming because fish live in water. I think I should use blue for the water and brown for the land. I might accidentally put a tree in the water because I think some trees can grow near water. I may also have similar colors for both habitats like using green for both trees and algae, which makes me unsure about how different they should look.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two habitats. On the left, a simple land habitat featuring a large tree with green leaves and a brown trunk, with a squirrel next to the tree. The ground is brown. On the right, a basic water habitat with blue water and simple green algae, featuring a fish swimming. The water habitat includes a tree mistakenly placed in the background. The drawing is done with basic colors and crayon-like strokes, showing a straightforward understanding of habitat differences.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt matches the student's abilities by depicting simple elements such as a tree and squirrel on land and algae with a fish in water, showing basic awareness of habitats. The drawing includes the mistake of placing a tree in the water habitat, illustrating the student's misunderstanding. The use of similar colors for both habitats indicates the student's difficulty in showing the diversity between them."
