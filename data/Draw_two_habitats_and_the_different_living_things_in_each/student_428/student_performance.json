  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two different habitats, one on land and one in water, but the representations might be simple or lack detail.",
    "The student can include basic types of plants, like a tree on land and simple aquatic plants like algae, demonstrating an introductory understanding of habitat-specific vegetation.",
    "The student can include common animals such as a squirrel on land and a fish in water, showing an emerging awareness of animal habitats."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not show a diverse range of plants in each habitat, possibly including the same kinds of plants in both habitats (e.g., trees in water) due to misunderstandings about plant habitats.",
    "The student might place animals incorrectly or include unrealistic animals in the habitats, such as placing a tiger in a water habitat or a dolphin on land.",
    "The student may struggle to make clear comparisons or show how the types of living things differ between the two habitats, potentially using similar colors or shapes for both habitats, indicating difficulty in understanding the diversity between them."
