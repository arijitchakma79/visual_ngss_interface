  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing the forest habitat on the left side of my paper. I remember that forests have a lot of trees, so I'll draw several tall trees with big, green leaves. I'll make sure to include different types of plants, too, like some bushes and grasses, so that it's a complete environment. I'll label the trees as 'Oak Trees' and the bushes as 'Berry Bushes.' Now, for the animals, I'll draw a couple of squirrels in the trees and a bird – maybe a robin – flying above. I'll write 'Squirrel' and 'Robin' near them. On the right side, I’ll draw a pond habitat. I know that ponds have aquatic plants, so I'll draw some water lilies and reeds. Underwater, I'll sketch a fish and label it 'Bass,' and near the pond's edge, I’ll add a clam and write its label. I'll compare the two habitats by showing that the forest has more types of trees and ground animals, while the pond has aquatic plants and water-dwelling animals. I might get a little confused with the size of the fish compared to the clam, making it slightly bigger than it should be, but I’ll make sure all parts are clear and labeled. I think this shows the different plants and animal species well and highlights the adaptations between living in water versus on land.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing depicting two distinct habitats: a lush forest on the left and a serene pond on the right. In the forest, tall oak trees with broad green leaves dominate, accompanied by smaller berry bushes and patches of grass. The trees host two playful squirrels, while a robin flits above. All elements are clearly labeled. On the right, the pond is bordered by tall reeds, with floating water lilies on its surface. Underwater, a moderately-sized bass swims, and a clam nestles near the water's edge, both labeled. The forest is vibrant with shades of green and hints of brown on tree trunks, while the pond is depicted with blue water and green aquatic plants. The overall drawing style is child-like yet detailed.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to create a detailed and accurate representation of two different habitats, as per the CAN section, by showing diverse plants and animals in each setting. Their comparison of the habitats through labeled drawings demonstrates understanding of species adaptations. Minor inaccuracies, such as proportion issues in the underwater scene, align with the CANNOT section, showing where the student might struggle without impacting overall clarity."
