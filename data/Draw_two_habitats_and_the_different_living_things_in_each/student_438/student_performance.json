  "Code": "2-LS4-1",

  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label two habitats, likely depicting a basic land habitat like a forest and a basic water habitat like a pond.",
    "The student can draw at least two different plants and animals in each habitat, although they might not always label them correctly.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to label at least three different plants and animals in each habitat consistently (student forgets or lacks knowledge of additional species).",
    "The student may not effectively compare and contrast the living things in the two habitats (student may depict similar plants and animals in both habitats without showing differences).",
    "The student may not clearly illustrate patterns in biodiversity, as they might not understand that certain plants and animals are specific to each habitat (student believes all habitats have the same types of living things)."
