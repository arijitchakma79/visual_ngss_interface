  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a forest for the first habitat. I know that forests have trees, so I'll draw a big tree with a trunk and branches. I'll add some leaves on the branches. Next, I'll draw a few small animals. A deer and a bird should work! I remember that deer have antlers, so I'll try to draw those. For the bird, a simple shape with wings should look good. I’ll label the tree and the deer but might forget to label the bird. For the second habitat, I’ll draw a pond. Ponds have fish, so I’ll draw a big fish with fins. I’ll add a frog near the water since frogs like ponds, and maybe a duck swimming. I’ll label the fish and try to label the frog. I want to show that these two habitats are different, but I might end up drawing things that look kind of similar because I don’t know many different plants and animals. Also, I’m not sure how to show diverse plants in these places, so they might look a little plain.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child's drawing with simple shapes and bright colors. The art depicts two habitats side by side. On the left, there's a forest scene with a large green tree and a brown deer with antlers; an unlabeled small bird flies nearby. On the right, a blue pond holds a large fish with fins and a frog near the edge; a duck floats in the water, but only the fish and frog are labeled. The style should be basic and slightly uneven, reflecting a child's developing drawing skills, with bold outlines and vivid colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two habitats with some living things, showing effort while indicating their struggles. The forest and pond are represented, with key living things included like trees, fish, and basic animal shapes. The use of labels aligns with what the student can label correctly, while the lack of labels and slight similarities in living things illustrates their emerging understanding and struggles in this task."
