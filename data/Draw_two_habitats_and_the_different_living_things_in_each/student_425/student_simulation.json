  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two habitats with different living things in each. Hmm, I remember that ponds usually have water, so I'll start by drawing a large blue circle for the pond. I'm not sure what else belongs there, so I'll add a simple fish shape in the water. For the second habitat, maybe a garden? I'll draw a patch of green for grass and a brown rectangle for a tree trunk with some green blob on top for leaves. Now, I'll put a stick figure bird at the top of the tree and a bug on the grass. I wonder if fish might be in the garden too, but maybe not. I think the bird and the bug are different enough for now. It's hard to think of what else goes where, so I might end up using the same creatures again.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing with two basic habitat scenes. On the left, a large blue circle represents a pond, with a simple fish shape inside it. On the right, a green patch of grass with a brown rectangle tree trunk and a green blob for leaves. There's a stick figure bird on top of the tree and a small oval shape on the grass meant to be a bug. The drawing is in crayon with basic colors and simple forms, showing minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by including basic shape representations of habitats and a couple of simple living things. It does not include diverse plant types or accurately matched animals to their habitats, as the student struggles with recognizing proper habitat elements and diversity."
