  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a land habitat. I remember that land habitats have trees and I should include animals like squirrels and lizards. I'll start with a big tree on the left side, maybe an oak, because I know squirrels like to climb trees. I'll draw a squirrel on one of the branches and label it. Below the tree, I'll make some bushes, and maybe a lizard hiding among them. Oh, I remember grass too, so I'll add some patches of grass around. Next, I'll tackle the water habitat. I know aquatic habitats have fish, so I'll draw a wide body of water on the right side, like a pond or lake. Iâ€™ll add two fish with different colors to show diversity and label each one. I've seen drawings with water plants like reeds and lily pads, so I'll include them too. I'll try to make it clear these are water plants, but I shouldn't confuse them with land plants. I'll add some details to the fish's fins, but I might not be able to show specific adaptations that well. I should remember to label everything, 'Fish,' 'Reeds,' etc., but sometimes I forget a label here and there. I'll try my best not to mix up where the animals belong in each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a student's illustration of two habitats. The left side shows a land habitat with a large oak tree with a squirrel labeled on a branch, bushes below, and patches of grass with a lizard nearby. The right side features a water habitat with a large pond containing two colorful fish labeled beneath the surface and labeled water plants like reeds and lily pads. The drawing is colorful, made with colored pencils, emphasizing large, clear labels. The style is detailed enough to be recognizable but still somewhat simplistic and childlike.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate and label two distinct habitats, with reasonable but not exhaustive detail. It encompasses the 'can' elements by including a variety of organisms specific to each habitat and labeling them, which reflects the student's level of proficiency. The limitations or 'cannot' elements are considered by acknowledging the student's potential pitfalls like missing labels and difficulty in depicting subtle ecosystem variations or adaptations."
