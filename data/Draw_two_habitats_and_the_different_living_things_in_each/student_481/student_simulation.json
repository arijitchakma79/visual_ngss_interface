  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a forest for the land habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I’ll draw several big trees with different types of leaves. Next, I'll add some bushes and smaller plants to show the plant diversity. Now, I’ll add animals like squirrels and deer because they live in the forest. I’ll make sure to draw them properly, even if I might accidentally make a squirrel look a bit bigger than it normally is. I also want to draw insects, but sometimes I forget to label them. Now, I'll draw the water habitat, like a pond. I'll include water plants like lily pads and reeds, and I’ll draw fish and frogs in the pond since they are typical pond animals. I might add a few small water insects but I could miss labeling those. I’ll use colors to differentiate these two habitats clearly: greens and browns for the forest, and blues and greens for the pond. I'll make sure I show the differences in plant and animal life between the forest and the pond clearly to demonstrate the diversity and adaptations in each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Create an educational drawing that features two distinct habitats. On one side, show a lush green forest with tall trees, shrubs, and a variety of forest animals like squirrels and deer. Use different shades of green and brown to depict the forest environment. On the other side, illustrate a vibrant pond habitat with lily pads, reeds, fish, frogs, and a couple of small aquatic insects. Use blues and greens to reflect the water habitat. The drawing style should be colorful and detailed, suitable for educational purposes, with labeled elements such as 'forest', 'pond', 'tree', 'deer', 'frog', to show clarity and educational value.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what a student at this level would accomplish by capturing advanced details like plant and animal diversity in both forest and pond habitats. It includes a range of species while acknowledging potential minor errors, such as occasionally unlabeled insects or the incorrect proportional size of some animals. The use of color and labeling in the prompt ensures key distinctions are clear, aligning with the student's ability to accurately distinguish and represent the two habitats."
