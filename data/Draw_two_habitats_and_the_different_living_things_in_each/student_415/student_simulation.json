  "Reasoning": "I’m supposed to draw two habitats and the living things in each one. Hmm, I think one habitat could be land and the other could be water. I'll start with the land. I remember land is like where we have parks, so I’ll draw a big blob for the land area, and I’ll make a green shape like a tree using a circle for the leaves and a stick for the trunk. Okay, for animals, maybe a circle and four lines for a dog. Now, the water habitat... I'll draw a big blue oval to show the water. I think fish live in the water, so I'll draw a simple fish shape, kind of like a pointed oval with a triangle for the tail. I think both places have plants, so I'll draw similar green blobby shapes in both. I should probably label stuff, but I don't really know what they're all called or where to put them.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing by a beginning-level student depicting two habitats: one land and one water. The land habitat is represented by a simple green blob on a flat surface with a basic tree shown as a circle on top of a stick, and an animal represented by a circle with four lines as legs. The water habitat is depicted with a blue oval shape representing water, with a fish shape that’s a pointed oval with a triangle tail. Both habitats include similar green shapes representing plants. The drawing uses minimal detail and does not include clear labels or distinctions between habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to form basic shapes for the habitats using simple outlines and generic representations of living things, such as blobs or basic shapes like circles and ovals. However, it also highlights their struggles – the habitats are not clearly differentiated, similar plant shapes are used in both environments, and there is no labeling or accurate positioning of specific living things."
