  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw two separate habitats with some basic shapes or outlines. The student might use simple shapes to represent land and water but may not distinguish the habitats clearly.",
    "Include one or two living things like a generic plant or animal, though these might not be recognizable or specific to a habitat. Example: a blob representing 'plant' or 'animal'."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Clearly identify or differentiate between the habitats, such as a garden and a pond. They may mix elements of land and water across habitats without realizing it or draw similar features for both (e.g., plants in the pond and fish on land).",
    "Identify and illustrate specific types of living things accurately (e.g., misplacing animals/plants that belong to water in a land habitat).",
    "Label any of the components correctly or show relationships between the plants and animals depicted. For example, they may not include any labels for trees, fish, etc.",
    "Demonstrate any understanding of biodiversity patterns or compare differences and similarities between the habitats due to a lack of comprehensive depiction or knowledge."
