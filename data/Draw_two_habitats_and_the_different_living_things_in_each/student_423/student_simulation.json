  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two different places where animals and plants live. Hmm... I'll start by drawing a big, open area on the left side and I'll call it a forest. I think I remember that trees go in a forest, so I'll draw a few tree shapes here. I'm not sure what else goes in a forest, so I’ll just add some bushes that look kind of like blobs. On the right side, I’ll try to draw a water place...maybe it’s a lake. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw one in the lake, but I'm not sure what else belongs there. Maybe a tree fits there too? I'll put a tree above the lake just in case. I think I should add some animal shapes, like a bird, somewhere in the forest, but I might also draw the same bird near the lake since I’m not sure where they live. I'm not sure what else to add, but I think insects or maybe a snake could be in both places. Coloring would be fun—I’ll make the trees green and the water blue; other parts can just be whatever color I feel like.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two habitats: on the left is a simple forest with uneven tree shapes and a few undefined green bushes. On the right is a water scene with blob-like blue water for a lake, and one tree hovering above the lake. A basic fish shape (misplaced for a land animal) and a similar bird shape appear in both habitats. The drawing is colorful, with flat, unrealistic coloring – green for trees and blue for water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's minimal understanding by including simplified shapes of trees in the forest and water in the lake. The placement of a tree above water, a fish in the forest, or similar birds in both is consistent with the confusion typical at this level of understanding. The drawing lacks clear differentiation between habitats and randomly places elements that are colored in a child-like style."
