  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw two different images without clearly identifying them as separate habitats.",
    "The student might include a few basic elements like simple shapes for plants or animals, but without distinction between land and water habitats."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly distinguish between a land habitat and a water habitat in their drawing (e.g., may draw two similar environments).",
    "The student may not illustrate different types of living things correctly between the habitats (e.g., might put a fish on land and a tree underwater).",
    "The student is unlikely to label or represent a variety of plants and animals in each habitat, possibly leaving elements unlabeled (unclear idea of what belongs in each habitat).",
    "The student will probably not depict comparisons of plant and animal diversity meaningfully (e.g., might draw the same few plants or animals in both habitats).",
    "The student can't effectively show patterns or distinctions in the distribution of living things across the habitats (might randomly place elements without pattern)."
