  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw two habitats and show the different living things in each. I'll start by drawing a big shape for land on the left side because I remember that land habitats have more soil and trees. I think I'll draw a simple tree. Trees need to go on the land, so I'll draw one with branches and some leaves. Then, I'll add a few shapes that look like clouds or maybe bushes. Next, I want to draw a water environment on the other side, so I'll make a big blue wavy shape for water. I think fish live in water, so I'll draw a simple fish shapeâ€”maybe a triangle and an oval together. I remember something about birds, so maybe I'll add a bird shape anywhere. But if I draw water on land, will that be okay? I'm also not sure how to make these two habitats look very different. For labels... I guess the tree can be 'tree' and the fish can be 'fish'. I'm not sure what else to add or how to show that there are lots of different plants and animals in each area. This seems more confusing because I can't remember different plants or animals clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two habitats. On the left, a land habitat with a simple tree that has green leaves and a brown trunk. There are a few cloud-like or bushy shapes in light green. On the right, a water habitat with a wavy blue shape representing water and a basic fish shape in it, drawn in blue as well. A simple shape representing a bird might be misplaced in the drawing. The drawing is colorful but lacks detail, variety, and clear distinctions between the habitats. There are a couple of labels, possibly misapplied, like the word 'tree' next to the tree and 'fish' near the fish.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents the student's ability to draw basic shapes that might be habitats but lacks clear distinction between land and water. The student can draw a few simple illustrations of living things, like a tree or a fish, but does not include variety or recognize different species. There is no effort shown to compare habitats, and the labels are minimal or possibly incorrect, highlighting the student's current limitations in understanding and expressing habitat diversity and differences."
