  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two habitats: a forest and a pond. I'll start with the forest because I know it well. I'll draw tall trees like oaks and pines, and add some bushes and grasses on the forest floor. For animals, I can draw a deer standing near some bushes, a squirrel climbing one of the trees, and a couple of birds flying in the sky above. Now for the pond. I'll draw a blue pond with some lily pads floating on the water. In the pond, I'll draw a fish swimming underneath, and maybe a frog sitting on one of the lily pads. Around the pond, I can add tall grasses and some algae in the water. I'll include a turtle on a rock in the pond, and a dragonfly flying above the water. Finally, I'll make sure to highlight the differences, like the frogs and fish only being in the pond and the deer only in the forest, but I'll also show some common things like the birds, which can be found in both habitats. I might forget to label each organism or not place them exactly in their usual spots, like maybe the fish is a bit too close to the pondâ€™s edge. Also, I might not show how all these animals interact with each other, like predator-prey relationships.",
  "Prompt": "Create a colorful hand-drawn style image of two distinct habitats side by side. On the left, a dense forest with tall oak and pine trees, bushes, and grassy floor. Include a deer, a squirrel on a tree, and birds in the sky. On the right, a pond with blue water, lily pads, and fish below the surface. Include a frog on a lily pad, algae in the water, and a turtle on a rock. A dragonfly hovers above the pond. The forest and pond should show clear differences and some similarities, like birds being present in both habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw and differentiate between two habitats, showing a variety of living things within each. The forest includes trees and animals like deer and squirrels, while the pond features aquatic life such as fish, frogs, and algae. The similarities, such as birds, are included as common elements in both habitats. The prompt aligns with the student's ability to show diversity and habitat-specific organisms but may lack details like labeling or precise placement, reflecting the student's potential struggles as mentioned in the 'CANNOT' section."
