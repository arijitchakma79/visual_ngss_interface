  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately identify and draw two distinct habitats, such as a forest on land and a pond in water, with clear and recognizable features unique to each environment.",
    "The student can correctly draw a variety of living things, including both plants and animals, within each habitat. For example, they might include trees, grasses, and squirrels in the forest, and fishes, algae, and water plants in the pond.",
    "The student can effectively show the diversity of life by including a wide range of living organisms within each habitat, representing both common and unique species.",
    "The student demonstrates an understanding of habitat-specific organisms by accurately showing plants and animals that are specific to one type of habitat, such as frogs in the pond and deer in the forest.",
    "The student can proficiently compare and contrast the living things in the two habitats by visually presenting what is common (e.g., birds) and what is unique (e.g., aquatic plants vs. terrestrial trees) to each habitat in their drawing."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit or misrepresent minor details, such as not labeling every organism they draw or slightly misplacing certain species (e.g., placing a common fish too close to the pond's edge which is usually land).",
    "The student might sometimes show less clarity in how certain animals interact within their habitats (e.g., relationships between predator and prey might not be illustrated)."
