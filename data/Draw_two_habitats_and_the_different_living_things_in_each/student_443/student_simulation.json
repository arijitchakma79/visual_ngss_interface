  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat on one side of my page. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I will draw a few tall, simple trees with green circles for leaves and brown rectangles for trunks. I should include some animals, like a bird. I'll just draw a simple bird shape with a small beak sitting on one of the trees, and maybe I'll add a few green triangular shapes for bushes. On the other side, I'll draw a pond habitat. I know there's water, so I will make a big blue oval shape for the water. I think a pond has fish, so I'll draw one fish shape with a triangle tail. I'll put some wavy lines for water plants. I remember birds can be in water areas too, but I won't add the same bird here. I'll draw a big sun in the sky too. I might get confused and add a small squirrel on the ground near the pond, even though they don't belong there, but it seems okay because I think they can be everywhere.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with two distinct halves: on the left, a simple forest with simple tree shapes in green and brown, a bush, and a simple bird on a branch. On the right, a pond with a big blue oval representing the water, one fish, and some wavy green lines for plants. Include a small brown shape for a squirrel near the pond and a big yellow sun in the sky. Use bright colors and child-like drawing style with simple shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's developing ability to identify basic elements of each habitat—trees and bush for the forest, water and fish for the pond—and includes a misunderstanding by placing a squirrel near the pond. The description uses simple shapes, bright colors, and child-like drawing style to reflect the student's emerging understanding and their typical drawing capabilities at this level."
