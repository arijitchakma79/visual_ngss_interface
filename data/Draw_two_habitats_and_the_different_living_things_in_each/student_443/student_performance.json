  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two different habitats, one on land, such as a basic representation of a forest, and one in water, like a simple pond.",
    "The student can include some living things in each habitat, like basic shapes representing trees and a few animals like a simple fish and perhaps a bird.",
    "The student can attempt to show different kinds of plants by drawing a few basic shapes but might not differentiate them clearly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show a variety of living things accurately, possibly drawing the same animal in both habitats without distinction.",
    "The student may misunderstand the kinds of plants or animals typical to each habitat, potentially placing a squirrel in the water habitat or a fish in the land habitat.",
    "The student cannot effectively compare the living things in both habitats, perhaps not highlighting differences and similarities correctly or at all.",
    "The student may inconsistently illustrate patterns, missing common features of each habitat type (e.g., thinking all trees look the same across different habitats)."
