  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different habitats. First, I'll make the land habitat. I think I'll add some trees and grasses there because I remember seeing those outside my house. Hm, I'm not sure if there's a specific tree or grass type needed, so I'll just draw a big tree and some grass patches. Now, I'll add a squirrel because I've seen them in trees before. I'm not quite sure what other animals should be here, so I'll just keep it simple. Now, for the water habitat. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll definitely include a couple of fish. I think I'll put some waves to show it's in water. I know there should be other living things, but I can’t really think of what else, so I'll leave it as just fish. It’s a bit confusing which plants go in water, so I'll skip that here. I'll make sure the colors are bright, with green for the land and trees, and blue for the water. I hope this shows the difference between land and water habitats.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two side-by-side habitats. On the left, a land habitat with a big green tree, patches of grass, and a simple drawing of a squirrel, all on a light green background. On the right, a water habitat with blue waves and two simple, yellow fish swimming. The drawings are bright and colorful but lack specific detail. The styles are simple, with thick outlines and basic shapes, resembling a beginner's sketch.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict two distinct habitats but with limited complexity in detail, particularly in distinguishing features and inhabitants. The land habitat includes basic elements like a tree and grass but lacks diverse flora and fauna. Similarly, the water habitat shows fish but no other aquatic life form, matching the student's struggle with accurately depicting a variety of living things. The bright colors and simple style communicate an emerging understanding characteristic of a developing level."
