  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a land habitat. I think I'll start with a green ground to show the grass. Then, I'll add a couple of trees, like big green blobs for leaves. Maybe an animal that I remember, like a deer, standing in the grass. I think deer go in this kind of habitat. Next, I'll draw a water habitat. I should make it blue for the water. I'll put a fish in the water, but I'm not sure if I should add other things. Oh, I’ll add some seaweed by making wavy lines. I know these are different places because one is on land and one is in the water, but I might forget some animals. I shouldn’t put a fish on the land or a deer in the water. I think that's it for now. I know there are more things that live in these places, but it's hard to remember all of them. I'll try to make the two parts look separate so it's clear they aren't the same habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two habitats on a single page. The left side shows a green land habitat with simple tree shapes and a brown deer in the grass. The right side shows a blue water habitat with a simple fish and hints of green seaweed. The style is like a child's drawing with bold, solid colors and minimal detail. Clear division in the middle to separate land from water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by including two distinct habitats, one land and one water, with basic elements like trees and a deer for the land, and fish and seaweed for the water. The student struggles with diversity of species and specific ecological details, which is reflected in the simplicity and lack of variety in the drawing. There's a clear separation of habitats to avoid mixing, but the selection of living things is basic, and there aren't more complex elements such as annotations or diverse species."
