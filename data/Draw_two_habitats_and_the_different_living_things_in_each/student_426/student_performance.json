  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to comprehensively show diverse types of plants and animals in each habitat or may mix habitats (e.g., placing aquatic animals in a land habitat).",
    "The student may struggle to make accurate comparisons through their drawings and may not effectively show differences in the types of living things present in each habitat.",
    "The student cannot clearly explain how their observations depict patterns in plant and animal diversity across different habitats, often lacking labeled elements or annotations to convey this understanding."
