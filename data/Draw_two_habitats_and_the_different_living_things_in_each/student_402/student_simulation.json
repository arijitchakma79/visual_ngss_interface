  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw two habitats. Hmm, I know there’s land and water, so I'll start with that. I’ll draw a big circle; that can be the land. Then I’ll draw a wavy line or something separate for the water. The animals, right, let me think. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a fish, but I don't really know what else goes only in water. Maybe I can draw a tree and a fish somewhere in the picture. I'll just put them anywhere because I'm not sure where they belong. A tree, maybe it goes on land but looks nice anywhere, and a fish, maybe it can be on land too, like fish fly sometimes! I remember animals like bears and lions, but I think I'd like to draw a bush. Oh, should that be called a squirrel? Sometimes trees have fluffy things like squirrels. I won't label all of these, as I don’t remember the names. Maybe I draw a line for water and a square for land, then put life in random places.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing featuring two very basic shapes to represent different habitats: a large irregular circle for land and a wavy rectangle for water. In both habitats, there's an inconsistent scattering of animals and plants: a fish drawn inside the circle for land, a tree extending from the edge of the water area, and a bush labeled as 'squirrel' somewhere in between. Colors are bright and simple, with green for land, blue for water, brown for the tree trunk, and a colorful mix for the animals. The drawing style is rough and childish, with no clear boundaries between habitats, capturing a playful but confused understanding of the task.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes for land and water, but without any clear differentiation between the two habitats. The student includes a tree and a fish but places them randomly without associating them with a particular habitat, demonstrating confusion over what belongs where. The fish on land shows the mixing of habitats, while the incorrect labeling of a bush as 'squirrel' shows the conflation of plants and animals. The overall randomness and lack of specific detail in placing animals and plants match the student's level description of minimal understanding."
