  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic shape that represents land and a separate shape that represents water, but without clear distinction between the two habitats.",
    "The student might draw a few common animals like a tree or a fish, but without placing them in a specific habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot clearly differentiate between the land and water habitats, often mixing up which living things belong in each (e.g., drawing a fish in the land habitat).",
    "The student is unlikely to label the different living things correctly, if at all, and may confuse plants with animals (e.g., labeling a bush as a 'squirrel').",
    "The student cannot provide specific examples of plants and animals in each habitat (e.g., drawing random squiggles as plants without specificity).",
    "The student is unable to observe or illustrate patterns of the types of living things typically found in each habitat (e.g., drawing the same animal in both land and water)."
