  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll draw two habitats. First, I'll start with a land habitat. I think land has grass, so I'll draw a big rectangular shape and color it green for the grass. For the sky, I want a blue arc on top. There should be some animals, so I'll add a few round shapes with legs to show animals. I remember trees are tall, so drawing brown lines with green circles on top might look like trees. Now for living things, I'll just draw whatever comes to mind; maybe a fish, even though it's not very clear if they belong here. Next, I should draw a water habitat. I'll draw a big blue area under a big yellow circle for the sun. I'll add wavy lines to make it look like water ripples. For water animals, I'll draw some fishes and an animal with long legs, like a bird or something. For plants, I'm not sure, but I'll add some flowers in the water because that seems right. I'm trying to show different things in each picture but sometimes I think of what should be in the water but draw them on land and vice versa.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing with two habitats: on the left, a simple rectangular green area representing land with a blue sky. There are basic shapes like circles with legs to represent animals and brown vertical lines with green tops symbolizing trees. Some fish shapes are present mistakenly on the land. On the right, a large blue area with wavy lines for a water habitat under a yellow circle resembling the sun. It includes fish shapes and an animal with long legs (like a bird) and basic flower shapes floating. Drawing style should be simple, with bright colors and minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities and challenges. They can draw basic shapes and use colors to indicate different habitats, but confuse habitat elements, like placing fish on land. Their understanding of plant and animal diversity is limited, often mixing things up, like adding flowers to water without clarity. This confusion is typical for their level where consistent differentiation between habitats is not achieved."
