  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and accurately draw two habitats, one on land and one in water.",
    "The student can draw a variety of plants in each habitat, effectively distinguishing between terrestrial and aquatic plants.",
    "The student can illustrate a selection of animals found in each habitat, showing a good level of diversity in living things.",
    "The student can demonstrate some patterns by comparing plant and animal life between the two habitats in their drawings, showing at least basic differences such as aquatic animals having fins vs. land animals having legs.",
    "The student can organize the drawing to clearly separate different plants and animals within each habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently show the full diversity of animal life, possibly repeating a few species rather than presenting a wide range.",
    "The student might miss some subtle patterns or interactions in ecosystems (e.g., may not depict interactions such as predator-prey relationships accurately).",
    "The student might leave out labels for some species or mislabel a few due to confusion about specific plant or animal types."
