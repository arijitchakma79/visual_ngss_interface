  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two habitats: one on land and one in water. I’ll start with the land habitat. I remember there are forests, so I'll draw a few trees with trunks and green leaves. Maybe I'll add some small bushes too. For animals, deer have legs, and I know there are birds like owls that might live here, so I'll draw them too. Oh, and bugs like butterflies and ants are good for land. Next, I’ll move to the water habitat. I think of it like a pond or maybe a small section of the ocean. I’ll draw wavy blue water lines to make it look like water. I'll include fish because they have fins, and maybe a turtle or frog, since they can be in water too. For plants, I think seaweed fits, so I'll draw some long, wavy green plants. I can also include some water lilies floating on the surface. Now, I need to show the differences. The fish and seaweed in water are different from things on land like trees and deer. I have to keep them separate so it's clear, but I could accidentally mix up some labels if I’m not careful. I think I can label most things, but I might get confused with certain plants or animals. I should draw it using simple cartoon style with bright colors so the animals and plants stand out.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split scene with two distinct habitats. On the left, depict a land habitat with green trees, a deer, an owl, butterflies, and ants in a cartoon style using bright colors. On the right, show an aquatic habitat with blue wavy water, fish, a turtle, a frog, and long, wavy green seaweed and water lilies. Use simple lines and make sure the habitats are clearly separate. Include labels for most species, focusing on clear differences like legs on land animals and fins on aquatic animals.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt incorporates the student’s ability to draw and distinguish habitats clearly, with diverse plant and animal life in each habitat, such as trees and deer on land, and fish and seaweed in water. It reflects their struggle with labeling consistency and the possible repetition of species due to challenges with showing full diversity, while still using bright colors and cartoon styles to match their proficient level."
