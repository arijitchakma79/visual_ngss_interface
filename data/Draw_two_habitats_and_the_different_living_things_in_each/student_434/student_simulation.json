  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two habitats, one for land and one for water. First, I’ll draw the land habitat. I remember that a simple land habitat can have things like trees or squirrels. I'll start with a big tree on the left side; trees have trunks and leafy tops, so I'll make sure to include those. I’ll add a squirrel next to the tree because squirrels live in trees. I think some grass should go on the ground too. Now, for the water habitat, I remember ponds are water habitats. I'll draw a pond shape on the right side. Let me add a fish in the pond. Fish live in water, so that makes sense. I think I can draw a lily pad floating on the pond too, because I’ve seen those before. I'm supposed to show that the land and water habitats are different, so putting different animals helps. Wait, what were those plants called again? Nevermind, I’ll skip putting names since I’m not sure. Sometimes I mix up where things go. I think I'll just keep it simple and hope I put the fish and the squirrel in the right places.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with two distinct habitats: on the left, a land habitat with a big tree, green grass, and a squirrel next to the tree. On the right, draw a water habitat with a pond that includes a fish and a lily pad. The drawing should use simple, child-like shapes and bright colors like green and blue to make it look vibrant. The style should be basic and cartoonish with bold outlines, resembling a young student's art project.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to draw basic elements of a land habitat (tree, squirrel) and a water habitat (pond, fish, lily pad). It recognizes the student's emerging understanding by showing differentiation with different animals and plants for each habitat. However, it does not include the labeling of plants and animals or a diverse range, as these are areas the student struggles with. The cartoon-like style reflects a developing skill level."
