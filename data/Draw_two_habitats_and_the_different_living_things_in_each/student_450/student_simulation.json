  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two habitats and show different living things in each one. I’ll start with the forest habitat. I remember that forests have trees, so I’ll draw a few big ones with green leaves. Maybe some bushes, too, because I think there are bushes in forests. Now, I’ll try to draw some animals. I think there are deer and squirrels in forests, so I'll draw those. Oh, but I’m not so sure if the fox I drew belongs. Now for the pond habitat. I’ve seen ponds with water, obviously, so I’ll draw a big blue pond. I recall there are cattails near ponds, so I’ll add those. Hmm, maybe a frog and a fish, too, but I’m not sure if adding a duck above the water is right. I’ll add it anyway because I think it can go there. I’m done! I know I haven’t drawn many different plants or animals, but I hope it’s okay.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of two habitats side by side: on the left, a simple forest scene with a few large green trees and some bushes. Include a deer and a squirrel, but also a misplaced fox. On the right, a pond scene with blue water, some cattails, and a frog and fish. There is also a misplaced duck above the water. The drawing is done with bright colors in a child-like, simple style, with minimal details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do: drawing simple scenes of a forest and a pond, including basic trees and aquatic plants. It also reflects their struggles: inaccurately placing some animals, showing minimal diversity, and lacking in comparison or grouping between habitats. These aspects match the student's emerging understanding at Level 2, as they show effort but have misunderstandings and inaccuracies."
