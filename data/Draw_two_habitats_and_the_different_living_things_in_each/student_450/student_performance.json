  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately draw or label several types of animals unique to each habitat, as they might include animals that don't belong (e.g., drawing a bear in the pond) or not label them (student doesnâ€™t know or is unsure).",
    "The student may struggle to draw clear comparisons between the habitats, providing limited visual evidence of how the living things differ (student does not see or understand the differences).",
    "The student may not effectively group similar plants and animals within each habitat, placing unrelated organisms together (e.g., grouping a fish with a squirrel in the forest habitat)."
