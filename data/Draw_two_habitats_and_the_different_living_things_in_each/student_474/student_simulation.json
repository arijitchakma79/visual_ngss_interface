  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the land habitat on the left side of my paper. I know that a land habitat can have trees, so I'll draw a big tree first. I remember that grasses are common too, so Iâ€™ll add some patches of grass around the tree. Next, I'll include animals like a squirrel and a lizard. I'll draw the squirrel up in the tree and the lizard on the ground near the grass. I think ants live on land, so I'll draw an underground ant tunnel and some ants around it. Now for the water habitat, I'll draw it on the right side. I'll start with some waves to show it's water. Fish should definitely be there, so I'll draw a few fish swimming. I think clams live in water too, so I'll draw a couple near the bottom. I need to label everything to make it clear. I'll write 'Tree' next to the tree and 'Grass' next to the grasses. The squirrel in the tree gets a label, as does the lizard on the ground. I'll put a label for the ants and their tunnel too. For the water, I'll label 'Fish' and 'Clam'. Sometimes I forget where things go, but I think I got it right this time. I may mix up details like specific plant types or exact animal features, but I understand what's needed in general.",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing with a simple but colorful style. On the left side, a land habitat with a large green tree, patches of green grass, a brown squirrel in the tree, a small green lizard on the ground, and an underground ant tunnel with little black ants around it. On the right side, a water habitat with blue wavy lines to represent water, several fish in different colors swimming, and two clams near the bottom. Each element has hand-drawn labels: 'Tree', 'Grass', 'Squirrel', 'Lizard', 'Ant', 'Fish', 'Clam'. The drawing should convey a basic understanding of the habitats with minimal detail in flora and fauna.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two distinct habitats and include appropriate living things, following the task guidelines. The student demonstrates their understanding by correctly placing labeled animals and plants in their respective habitats. The drawing is simple and not overly detailed, which corresponds with the student's described proficiency level, and minor inaccuracies, such as possible mislabeling or lack of detail, are acknowledged without impacting the overall correctness of the habitats and their living things."
