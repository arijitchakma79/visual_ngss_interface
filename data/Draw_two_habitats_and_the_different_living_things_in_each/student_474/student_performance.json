  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two distinct habitats, one representing land and the other representing water, with clear differences.",
    "The student can include a variety of appropriate living things in each habitat, such as trees, grasses, lizards, squirrels, and ants for the land habitat, and fish and clams for the water habitat.",
    "The student can label most of the different living things found in each habitat, demonstrating an understanding of their proper placement.",
    "The student can show some degree of pattern or diversity in the plant and animal life of each habitat, though this might not be very detailed."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally mislabel some living things or place them in the wrong habitat (e.g., a clam on land or a lizard in water, possibly due to momentary confusion or oversight).",
    "The student might not fully capture more subtle patterns of biodiversity, such as the specific adaptations of plants and animals to their habitats (student shows a general understanding but lacks depth)."
