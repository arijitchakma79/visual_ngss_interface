  "Reasoning": "Okay, I have to draw two different habitats and show the living things in each one. First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I remember forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw some big, green trees. I should add animals like a deer and a bird. I think birds and deer live in forests. I'll try to label them, but I might spell them wrong. In the second habitat, I'll draw an ocean. Oceans have water, so I'll draw lots of blue waves. I'll put a fish and a crab in there because I know they live in oceans. But I have to be careful to make sure I donâ€™t mistakenly put land animals in the ocean habitat. I remember fish, so I'm doing okay. I think crabs are in the ocean too. I'll label them, but sometimes I might forget. I should try to make the forest and the ocean look different. Hmm, I might forget to show some important parts, like other plants or more animals, because I'm not sure what else should go in each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two separate areas: on the left, a forest with big green trees, a deer, and a bird, with each living thing roughly labeled. On the right, an ocean with blue waves, a fish, and a crab, each one labeled simply. The drawing style is simple and colorful, with bold crayon-like strokes, reflecting an emerging understanding of habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's level because it describes a child-like, colorful drawing that includes the basic elements of two habitats: a forest with trees and a few animals, and an ocean with water and sea creatures. The student is able to show some recognizable features and living things, but the details might be missing or labels can be incorrect, reflecting their developing understanding."
