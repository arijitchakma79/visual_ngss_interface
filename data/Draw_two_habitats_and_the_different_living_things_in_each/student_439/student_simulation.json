  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the land habitat. I'll make some simple outlines for trees with a brown trunk and green leaves. I will add a few scattered bushes using green blobs. For living things, I can draw a basic, simple bug, maybe like a small circle with legs to look like an ant, and some birds in the sky. I'm not sure about including more animals or different plants. Now, I'll try to draw a water habitat. I'll make a big blue blob to show a body of water. I should include some fish, so I'll draw a simple fish shape with a triangle for a tail and a small dot for the eye. I'm not sure what else to add around the water, so my water habitat is just the water and the fish right now. I know I have to show living things in both habitats, but I might use the same bugs and birds in both land and water since I can't think of different animals.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two habitats with emphasis on simplicity and basic shapes. On the left, depict a land habitat featuring simple trees with brown trunks and green, circular tops, a few scattered green blob-shaped bushes, and small bugs resembling circles with lines for legs. Include simple V-shaped birds in the sky. On the right, show a water habitat with a large blue shape representing water, containing basic fish shapes with triangle tails and dots for eyes. Ensure minimal environmental detail around the water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic elements for each habitat, such as trees and a water body, as per the 'can do' list. The student includes some living things, like bugs and fish, but lacks diversity, mainly repeating similar designs across both habitats, which aligns with the 'cannot do' elements. The prompt accounts for the student's emerging understanding and their focus on a few basic living things."
