  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a land habitat. I remember that in a forest habitat, there are lots of trees, so I'll draw some tall trees with green leaves. I'll also add grass because I know different kinds of plants grow on the ground. For animals, I'll draw a squirrel in one of the trees and a lizard sitting on a rock. To show variety, I'll include a few birds flying in the sky and a deer standing among the trees. Next, I'll draw a water habitat. I'll use blue to show water, and I'll draw seaweed and some aquatic plants underwater. I'll add fish swimming around, and I remember that frogs live in water, so I'll draw a frog on a lily pad. I'll include a duck on the water surface to show different types of animals. I need to label the plants and animals, but sometimes I might forget to label every single one. Also, I should remember that there are tiny creatures like insects, but I often leave them out of my drawings. I'll make sure that what I draw shows that land and water habitats have different kinds of plants and animals.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two habitats: on the left, a vibrant forest with tall green trees and grass, featuring a squirrel, lizard, birds, and a deer, all under a clear blue sky. On the right, an aquatic habitat with blue water, seaweed, aquatic plants, fish, a frog on a lily pad, and a duck on the water's surface. The drawing style is advanced and colorful, focusing on clear distinctions between land and water environments, highlighting the biodiversity and unique adaptations of plants and animals in each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a variety of both plants and animals in two distinct habitats with an emphasis on showing the different adaptations in land and water environments. The vivid and detailed description reflects the student's advanced level of understanding. However, consistent with the student's limitations, the prompt acknowledges a lack of specific labeling for some plants and animals and the absence of smaller organisms, which is typical in the student's work."
