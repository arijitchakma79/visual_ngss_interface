  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start with the forest habitat. I remember seeing forests in pictures with lots of green trees—so I'll draw tall trees. I'll draw a few different types, maybe a pine tree and leafy ones like an oak. In the forest, I’ll add a squirrel because I know squirrels live in trees. I'll also draw a bird, like a robin, flying above. I think rabbits live in forests, too, so I'll draw one on the ground. Next, I'll move to my aquatic habitat—a pond. I know ponds have water, so I'll draw a big area of blue to show the water. I'll add a couple of fish swimming. I remember seeing water lilies in a pond before, so I'll draw some of those floating on the surface. I’ll also draw a frog sitting on a lily pad. Ducks swim in ponds, so I’ll add a duck swimming as well. Now for labeling, I'll label the trees, the squirrel, and one or two more things, but I might forget to label everything. I notice I'm not including insects like ants or small pond bugs, but I find bigger things easier to remember. I wish I could make more connections, like what these animals eat or how they adapt to the habitat, but right now, I'm focused on making sure I've drawn a variety of living things. I think my drawing looks good, mostly showing different living things in each habitat clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful illustration of two habitats side by side. On the left, depict a vibrant, green forest with tall trees—some look like pine trees, others like broad-leaved trees. Add a squirrel climbing one of the trees, a bird such as a robin flying above, and a brown rabbit on the ground. On the right, show a blue pond with a duck swimming on the water, a few fish visible under the surface, and lily pads with a frog sitting on one. Include some green aquatic plants. Use bright colors and a child-like, hand-drawn style. Label a few but not all organisms in the drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student is able to do, such as correctly depicting two different habitats with a variety of living things typical to each, like the forest with trees, a squirrel, and a rabbit, and the pond with fish, ducks, and frogs. The limitations in the prompt, like incomplete labeling and the absence of smaller or less obvious living things such as insects, align with what the student struggles with. The drawing style suggested is simple, resembling a child's illustration, indicating that the student is focusing more on appearance than advanced ecological concepts."
