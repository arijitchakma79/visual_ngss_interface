  "Topic": "Draw two habitats and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can identify and illustrate two different habitats, such as a forest and a pond, clearly depicting one on land and one in water.",
    "The student can draw several types of living things found in each habitat, such as trees and squirrels in the forest, and fish and aquatic plants in the pond.",
    "The student can make partial comparisons between the types of living things in the two different habitats, possibly noting that animals in the pond swim and those in the forest walk or fly.",
    "The student can demonstrate some diversity by including a variety of plants and animals in each habitat, showing a range of species like evergreens, ducks, lily pads, etc.",
    "The student can organize their drawing to mostly clearly show patterns of plant and animal diversity across the habitats, with creatures appropriately placed in their respective habitat."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may miss some specific or less obvious types of living things, such as insects in the forest or microscopic organisms in the pond (student focuses on larger or more noticeable organisms).",
    "The student might have incomplete labeling or inconsistently apply labels to all organisms, sometimes not clearly linking names to the drawn items (lack of detail in labeling).",
    "The student may struggle with making more sophisticated ecological comparisons, such as food chains or specific adaptations in each habitat (focuses more on appearance rather than ecological interactions)."
