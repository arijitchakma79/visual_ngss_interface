  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the two different habitats. First, I’ll draw a forest for the land habitat. I remember forests have a variety of trees, so I’ll include tall pine trees and oak trees. I should also add some smaller plants like bushes and colorful flowers to show more diversity. Next, I’ll draw some animals that live in the forest. I'll include a deer, a fox, and some birds flying above the trees. For the water habitat, I'll choose a pond. I know ponds have water plants, so I’ll draw lily pads and some tall grasses at the edge of the pond. I’ll add fish swimming in the water, a frog on a lily pad, and maybe a turtle sunbathing on a rock. I need to make sure that each habitat looks different and shows different living things. I can show patterns by having multiple trees in the forest and several fish in the pond. I’ll label each plant and animal, but I need to be careful not to mix up the labels, like labeling a tree as a bush by mistake. I'll focus on the main elements first and might not add much background detail like clouds.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed colored pencil drawing showing two distinct habitats side by side. On the left, a lush green forest with tall pine trees, oak trees, bushes, and colorful flowers. Keywords are trees, deer, fox, birds, and clear labels. On the right, a serene pond with water plants, lily pads, and tall grasses. Include fish, a frog on a lily pad, and a turtle on a rock, all clearly labeled. Use realistic colors: greens, browns for the forest, blues, and greens for the pond. The scene should be organized, but without extensive background elements like clouds or incidental rocks, to depict a clean and focused representation.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's strengths in creating accurate representations of distinct habitats with appropriate and diverse living things. It highlights the student’s ability to show differences in plant and animal life by specifying distinct species for each habitat. The prompt acknowledges the student's potential for minor mislabeling and lack of background details, ensuring the primary focus remains on the habitats and their inhabitants, aligning with the student's described capabilities and limitations."
