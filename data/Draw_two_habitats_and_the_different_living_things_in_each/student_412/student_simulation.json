  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw two different habitats and the living things in each. I remember there are places like forests and oceans, but I think they might look kind of similar when I draw them. Maybe I'll start with one habitat on one side where I can put some trees—trees are in habitats, right? I'll make them simple, just sort of triangle shapes with a brown line for a trunk. Then I'll add some animals. I like animals, so I'll draw circles with ears for some. I think I'll put the animals I remember, like a bear and a bird, but these might look the same as ones in the other habitat. For the second habitat, I'll draw another scene next to the first one. I'll try to make it different by maybe coloring the ground blue, but it might still look like the first one. I'll put some fish shapes in there because fish live in some habitats. Even though I want to show they're different, there might be the same trees and some of the same animals too. I hope the color difference kind of helps show they aren’t exactly the same place.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing featuring two side-by-side habitats. The left habitat shows simple trees with green triangles and brown lines for trunks. In there, are simple circle shapes with ears resembling animals, possibly a bear and a bird, but not distinct. The right habitat has a differently colored ground, possibly blue, to signify a different environment but with similarly simple trees and animal shapes, including some fish-like shapes. The drawings use colorful crayons or markers, without much detail, and both habitats appear similar despite color differences.",
  "Explanation": "The prompt reflects the student's level of understanding that involves minimal differentiation between habitats. The trees and animals are similar in both scenes, emphasizing the student's struggle to show distinct features of the habitats. The usage of blue suggests an attempt to differentiate between land and water, but both drawings share basic shapes and lack clear diversity between each habitat, which is consistent with the student's capabilities and limitations."
