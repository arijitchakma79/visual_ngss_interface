  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a land habitat. I'll start by drawing some trees because I remember that many animals live in or around them, like squirrels and birds. I'll add a bush and some grass too for more variety. I’ll then draw a little lizard on a rock to show another type of creature that lives there. Ok, now time for the aquatic habitat. I'll draw the water first, like a big pond or a small lake. Inside, I'll make sure to draw some fish swimming—maybe a big one and a small one. I'll also sketch a clam on the bottom of the pond because I know they can live there. Some aquatic plants will also be in the water, with their long stems reaching upward. I know I should label these things, so I'll label some of the bigger ones like the tree, fish, and lizard, but sometimes I forget to label every single plant I draw. Finally, I should compare the lizard with one of the fish to show they're in different habitats. I think the lizard is best compared with the fish because one swims and one crawls. I think my drawing mostly shows what kinds of living things are in each place, even though I might forget to draw special things like plants and animals helping each other.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed drawing of a land and aquatic habitat side-by-side. On the left, depict a vibrant land habitat with tall green trees, a lizard on a rock, a squirrel on a tree branch, and some grass and bushes. On the right, show an aquatic habitat with clear blue water, including fish swimming, a clam resting on the bottom, and aquatic plants with long green stems. Use labels like 'Tree', 'Lizard', 'Fish'. The style should be colorful and slightly cartoonish, showing clear effort in illustrating diversity but with a few missing labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by including distinct land and aquatic habitats with appropriate living things in each. The prompt includes trees, grasses, and small animals in the land habitat and fish, clams, and plants in the water habitat, matching the student's strengths. The student occasionally forgets labels, as noted in the 'cannot' section, thus not all living things in the drawing are labeled. The drawing demonstrates patterns of plant and animal diversity in the student's own expressive, slightly cartoonish style."
