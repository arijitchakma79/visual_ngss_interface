  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely to show limited differences in the biodiversity of the habitats beyond a few examples *(student sees habitats too generally and might not represent the full diversity)*.",
    "The student may struggle to clearly illustrate patterns or comparisons between the two habitats, such as showing similar types of organisms, without guidance *(student hasn't grasped the concept of habitat comparisons yet)*.",
    "The student often omits detailed labeling or labels incorrectly, which can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of their intended message *(labeling is inconsistent or unclear)*."
