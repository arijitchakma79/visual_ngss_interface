  "Reasoning": "First, I'll think about two different types of habitats. I'll choose a forest for the terrestrial habitat and a pond for the aquatic habitat. In the forest section, I'll draw several tall trees with lots of green leaves and some bushes underneath. I know that birds and squirrels live in the forest, so I'll add a couple of birds in the branches and a squirrel on one of the trees. Next, for the pond habitat, I'll draw some water with lily pads floating on top. I remember that fish are often underwater, so I'll draw a few fish swimming below the water's surface. I'll make sure to show some aquatic plants next to the fish. Now, for the patterns and labeling: I'll be careful to label the trees, birds, squirrels, pond, fish, and lily pads. I want to clearly show the differences between the habitats, like how the birds are in the trees and the fish are underwater. I might forget to label something small, but I'll try my best to get it all. Iâ€™ll use different colors to make it clear: green for the trees and bushes, blue for the water, and various colors for the animals.",
  "Prompt": "Create an image of a child's drawing featuring two distinct habitats. The first habitat is a forest with tall green trees, bushes, and animals like birds in the branches and a squirrel on a tree. The second habitat is a pond with blue water, lily pads on the surface, and fish swimming underwater. Include labels for the trees, birds, squirrels, pond, fish, and lily pads. Use bright colors and a playful, childlike drawing style to indicate effort and attention to detail appropriate for an advanced student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by depicting two distinct and detailed habitats, complete with accurately placed living organisms, such as birds in trees and fish underwater. The prompt also includes the use of labels, enabling clear communication of observed patterns and differences between the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The inclusion of bright colors and a childlike style reflects the student's advanced effort while acknowledging the potential for minor omissions in labeling."
