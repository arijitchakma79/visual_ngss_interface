  "Reasoning": "I think I'll start by drawing the land habitat. I know forests usually have big trees, so I'll draw a couple of those with green leaves. I'll add a squirrel because I remember seeing them in my local forest. I'll also draw a few birds sitting in the tree branches, maybe some brown or red ones like I see sometimes. For the grass, I'll just use green underneath the trees. Now for the water habitat, I'll draw a pond. I'm going to make some wavy lines to show water and put a fish in there since fish live in the water. I'll put a duck on the surface of the water. Maybe I'll also add a few lily pads floating around. Oh, I almost thought of adding a dolphin, but I know they're not in ponds, so I'll keep them out this time. I should remember to add more plants around the pond, some reeds or small bushes. I know there are probably bugs or algae too, but Iâ€™m not sure exactly how to show those.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a child's illustration that features two distinct habitats: a forest and a pond. The forest side should have tall, leafy green trees with brown trunks, a brown squirrel on one of the branches, and a couple of colorful birds perched in the canopy. The ground is covered in green grass. The pond should be depicted with light blue wavy water, a fish swimming beneath the surface, and a duck on top of the water. Add a few lily pads floating on the pond. Surround the pond with green reeds and small bushy plants. Use a bright, cheerful color palette and a simple, hand-drawn style typical of elementary school artwork.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns well with what the student can do: drawing two different habitats showing recognizable features and including appropriate living organisms, like squirrels in the forest and fish and ducks in the pond. It avoids placing the dolphin incorrectly in the pond and acknowledges the student's limited ability to represent or remember smaller organisms, like bugs or algae."
