  "Reasoning": "Okay, let's start with drawing two habitats. I'll begin with the land habitat. I think a forest would be a good choice. I remember forests have trees, bushes, and some animals like squirrels, birds, and maybe a lizard. So, I'll draw a few tall trees, some smaller bushes at the bottom, and a squirrel climbing a tree. I can add a couple of birds flying or sitting on branches. I have to make sure the trees look tall and leafy; that looks accurate enough. Now, let's do the water habitat. I choose a pond because I remember ponds have fish. I’ll draw some water with some fish in it. I think clams live in water too, but I'm not entirely sure which ones. I'll put a couple of oval shapes at the bottom as clams. Maybe adding some water plants would make it look better. Oh, I should remember to show some differences between the habitats, like how one has trees and the other has water. Adding labels might help; I'll label the forest and pond, and label the squirrel and fish. I won't label every single thing since I might get them wrong. Let's draw a comparison... Trees only in the forest and water only in the pond. I think I have a variety of living things, although I could have added more, like insects or more water animals, but I'm not sure exactly what other species to draw. I'll make sure everything’s spaced out so it doesn’t look too crowded.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed student drawing featuring two habitats side by side. On the left, a forest scene with tall, leafy trees, small bushes, a squirrel climbing one of the trees, and a couple of birds. The trees are big and green, and the ground is covered with various greens representing bushes and grass. On the right, a pond with blue water, fish swimming, a couple of brown oval shapes representing clams at the bottom, and water plants visible. Some labels are visible: 'Forest', 'Pond', 'Squirrel', 'Fish'. The drawings highlight differences like trees versus water and include a moderate array of living things. The style is colorful and childlike, showing an effort to capture the general feel of each habitat without intricate details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities by showcasing their competence in drawing both land and water habitats with evident features such as trees, water, and basic living organisms, demonstrating the proficiency level. The student is able to depict a variety of living things, though some may not be as intricately detailed or accurately labeled, which matches the 'cannot do' list of potential inaccuracies in identification and label precision. Further, the use of labels and distinct features like trees and water bodies cater to their capacity to make basic informative comparisons between the habitats."
