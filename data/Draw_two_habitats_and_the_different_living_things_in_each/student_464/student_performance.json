  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw two different habitats, one land (like a garden or forest) and one water (like a pond or stream), with mostly accurate depictions of the environment.",
    "Include different living things in the land habitat such as trees, grasses, bushes, and some animals like lizards or squirrels.",
    "Show different living things in the water habitat, likely including fish or clams, although details might be less intricate.",
    "Display some comparisons between the two habitats, possibly through labeling or drawing features that highlight differences.",
    "Show patterns in diversity by depicting a variety of living things in each habitat, though some variety might be less detailed.",
    "Organize the drawings fairly well, with clear indications of which living things belong to which habitat, though there might be minor misplacements."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Accurately label or identify all specific living things, as some species might be incorrectly named or missing appropriate labels *(student might not remember exact names)*.",
    "Include all possible comparisons between the habitats, as the student might overlook some less obvious differences *(student may not recognize all diversity aspects)*.",
    "Capture the full range of habitat-specific characteristics, such as water flow in streams or canopy layers in forests, due to incomplete understanding or rushed execution."
