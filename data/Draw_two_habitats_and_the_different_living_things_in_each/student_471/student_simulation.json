  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a land habitat. I’m going to make it a forest because forests have lots of different living things. I’ll start with drawing some trees; tall ones with big, green leaves. I'll add some bushes around the trees too. Now, I need to draw some animals. I’ll draw a squirrel on one of the tree branches and a few ants on the ground near the bushes. I think I should draw a bird flying above the trees too. Now, I’ll draw a water habitat. I’m thinking of a pond, so I’ll draw the water first, making it a nice blue color. Next, I'll draw some fish swimming in the pond. I’ll also add some water plants. Maybe I can draw a frog on one of the rocks by the water and a turtle on the shore. I have to make sure each habitat is different. They look pretty good side by side. I might forget to label all the living things or put everything in the right spot, like remembering to keep land animals on land and water animals in water. I hope I included enough variety in each habitat!",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two distinct habitats. The first is a forest with tall trees with green leaves, bushes, a squirrel on a branch, ants on the ground, and a bird flying above. The second is a pond with blue water, fish swimming inside, water plants, a frog on a rock, and a turtle on the shore. Use bright colors and a simple, hand-drawn style. Place the two habitats side by side with attempts at labeling, but some labels might be missing or misplaced.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two distinct habitats with a reasonable variety of living things in each, which aligns with the student's proficiency level. It incorporates trees, bushes, and animals like squirrels and ants in the land habitat and fish and water plants in the water habitat. While the drawing reflects effort and basic understanding, it also allows for minor inaccuracies, such as potential omissions in labeling or slight misplacement of elements, consistent with the student's potential struggles."
