  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I remember that a forest has tall trees, so I'll start with sketching a few different types of trees. Oaks, pines, and maples all have different shapes of leaves and branches, which I need to show. I'll add some animals like birds. They’ll be sitting or flying around the trees, and I'll try to detail their feathers. Let’s not forget the squirrels; they’re often seen climbing trees, so I'll draw a couple on the branches. That's three living things: trees, birds, squirrels. Now moving to the pond habitat. I'll draw water with some water plants like lilypads or cattails on the edges. Inside the pond, I'll include fish, swimming near the surface, and a frog sitting on a lilypad. I have to show that these are very different from the forest creatures. I’ll make sure to add labels to both drawings to show the variety. Let’s use colored pencils to bring it all to life; green and brown for the forest, and blue, green, and a bit of gray for the pond. I need to remember the size balance; sometimes my fish end up too big. Let's see if I get that right this time.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two habitats. On the left, a forest scene with various trees such as oak, pine, and maple, showcasing different leaf shapes and brown bark textures. Birds are perched or flying around the trees, drawn with colorful feathers, and squirrels climbing branches. On the right, an aquatic pond habitat with clear blue water. Include lilypads and cattails at the edges. Within the pond, fish swim just below the surface, and a frog sits on a lilypad. Use soft colored pencils, emphasizing greens, browns, blues, and grays. Both habitats have labels identifying the types of plants and animals. The drawing should be neat with clear distinction between the habitats, but note minor proportion inaccuracies, like some fish appearing slightly large relative to the pond size.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's capability to accurately illustrate and distinguish between forest and pond habitats with specific living things. It covers the requirement for diversity and organization while being aware of the occasional proportional mismatches, like fish size, which aligns with the student's level description of advanced understanding with small errors."
