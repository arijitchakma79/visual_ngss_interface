    "The student can accurately identify and illustrate a terrestrial habitat such as a forest and an aquatic habitat such as a pond, clearly distinguishing between the two.",
    "The student can draw at least three different kinds of living things in each habitat: for example, trees, birds, and squirrels for the forest; fish, water plants, and frogs for the pond.",
    "The student can clearly delineate the differences in the types of living things that exist in each habitat, such as showing land animals in one and aquatic creatures in the other.",
    "The student can illustrate patterns in the diversity of plants and animals across both habitats, such as showing a wide variety of tree species in the forest and different types of fish in the pond.",
    "The student can organize the drawing clearly, compare the variety of life present in each habitat, and possibly label them accurately."

  "CANNOT": [
    "There may be minor inaccuracies in illustrating specific details or proportions of the living things, such as the size differences between species (e.g., drawing a fish too large relative to the pond).",
    "The student may occasionally omit labels for some living things or forget to include a certain type of plant or animal in one of the habitats, but these are rare and do not detract from the overall understanding."
