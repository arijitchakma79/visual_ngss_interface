  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a string telephone connecting two students, demonstrating a basic understanding of how it functions.",
    "The student can illustrate the path of sound waves traveling through the string, often with arrows or lines (though arrows might be inconsistently applied or not fully explained).",
    "The student can identify and depict the specified materials (e.g., cups and string) used to create the string telephone.",
    "The student can show how the string serves as a medium for sending and receiving information across a distance, reflecting understanding that the string is crucial for the sound to travel."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully depict or misrepresent how sound waves travel through the air and string (e.g., waves drawn inaccurately or waves shown stopping at the cups).",
    "The student might not explicitly label all parts of the system, such as failing to label one or both 'cups' or neglecting to identify specific components necessary for the device's function.",
    "The student might show incomplete or inaccurate details about solving communication over long distances (e.g., unclear why the string telephone is effective over long distances without explaining tension or material)."
