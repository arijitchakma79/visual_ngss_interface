  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students standing apart from each other. I’ll make sure there is a lot of space between them so it's clear they are far away. I remember that the string is important because it’s what carries the sound. I'll draw a cup in each student's hand, connected by a taut string. I need to make the string straight to show that it's being used effectively. Now, I'll draw lines or symbols near the string to indicate the sound waves traveling through it. I’ll add some labels to each part, like 'cup' and 'string.' Oh, I might forget one label, but I’ll try my best not to. The cups are important because they help with the sound, so I’ll draw them clearly. I know the task is about how the string allows them to talk, so I'll draw one student speaking and the other listening. I might use some colored pencils to make it more vivid, like using blue for the cups and red for the sound waves.",
  "Prompt": "A colored pencil drawing of two students standing far apart, each holding a cup with a taut string connecting the cups. The students are in a grassy field under a blue sky. One student is speaking into the cup while the other listens. Label each cup and the string. Include dashed lines around the string to symbolize sound waves traveling through it. Use colors like blue for the cups, green for the grass, and red for the sound waves. The drawing style is neat and detailed, reflecting an advanced level of understanding, but with one minor label missing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all the elements the student can effectively draw, such as the students far apart, the string as the medium for sound, and detailed labels like 'cup' and 'string.' It includes symbols to indicate sound, highlighting their understanding of communication through the string, not light. The use of colors demonstrates an effort to represent the materials accurately. A minor forgotten label aligns with the rare omissions described in their abilities."
