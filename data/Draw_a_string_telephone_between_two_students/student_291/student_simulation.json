  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students. On the left, I'll draw a boy holding a cup to his ear. On the right, I'll draw a girl speaking into another cup. I'll remember that the cups are important for our string telephone. Now, I'll connect the cups with a line to represent the string. I know the string is crucial because it carries the sound, so I'll make sure it looks straight to show it's under tension. I'll draw some arrows along the string to show the sound waves traveling, but I'm not sure if I need to show them continuing past the cups. I'll try anyway, just in case. I'll label the string but might forget to label the cups since I'm focusing on the string. Let's use colors to make it clear: blue for the string, red arrows for the sound waves, and different colors for the kids' clothes. I think I should include the environment too, like a small patch of grass and a sunny sky to show it's happening outdoors. I'm not sure how to show why the string telephone works over long distances, but I'll do my best with the basic setup.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a string telephone setup with two students. On the left, a boy with brown hair holds a cup to his ear. On the right, a girl with blond hair is speaking into a cup. Both cups are connected by a straight blue string. Red arrows are inconsistently placed along the string to indicate sound waves, with some arrows not fully extending beyond the cups. The cups are not labeled. The background includes a grassy field and a sunny sky, with the scene in bright, cheerful colors. The drawing style is simple and colorful, with a focus on presenting the main concept rather than detailed explanations.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to correctly depict the string telephone setup and the use of the string as a medium for sound. It shows the student's understanding of illustrating sound waves with arrows, though not fully extending them correctly. The lack of labels for the cups and incomplete depiction of sound wave travel illustrates the student's current limitations. The inclusion of a bright and colorful outdoor setting matches the student's effort to contextualize the scene and aligns with the proficiency level described."
