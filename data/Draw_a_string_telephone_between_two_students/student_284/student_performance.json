  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a string telephone device, showing two cups with a taut string between them, allowing communication over a distance.",
    "The student can clearly depict in the drawing that the device uses sound waves to communicate by illustrating sound waves moving along the string.",
    "The student can identify and label all the materials used in the string telephone, such as the cups and string, in their drawing.",
    "The student can include two people using the device, illustrating the concept of communication over distances.",
    "The student can illustrate and label how the string telephone allows the transmission of sound, possibly with arrows indicating the direction of sound travel.",
    "The student can add labels or annotations explaining how this technology is used by humans and how life would be different without such devices."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There may be minor inaccuracies in the depiction of sound waves or the visual representation of sound transmission, such as inconsistent wave patterns or slightly incorrect direction arrows (e.g., waves drawn inaccurately).",
    "The student might miss adding a small detail, like labeling the exact material type of the string (e.g., twine, yarn), but overall, these do not detract from the understanding."
