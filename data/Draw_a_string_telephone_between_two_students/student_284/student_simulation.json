  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick-figure students standing apart from each other. I’ll draw one on the left and the other on the right. I remember they need to be connected by a string telephone. I’ll draw a straight line for the string that connects them. I know a string telephone uses cups at each end, so I’ll draw a simple cup shape at the end of the string that each student is holding to their ear or mouth. Next, I want to illustrate how the sound travels along the string, so I’ll draw some arrows along the string pointing from one student to the other to show this direction. I think I could try to draw some wavy lines around the string or near the cups to show sound waves or vibrations. For labeling, I need to remember to label the string and the cups – I can write 'string' alongside the line and maybe 'tin can' or 'cup' near the cups. Lastly, maybe I can draw a little speech bubble above each student to show them talking, but this is a bit tricky. It could show them saying 'hello' or something simple. I might forget to label one cup, but it shouldn’t be too big of a problem, as the main elements are clear.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn style image depicting two stick-figure students using a string telephone. One student is on the left, the other on the right, connected by a long, straight line representing a string. Each student holds a small cup at the ends of the string against their ear or mouth. Along the string, arrows are drawn to indicate the direction sound travels. Wavy lines suggest sound waves or vibrations. Labels are present: 'string' written along the string and 'cup' next to at least one of the cups. Speech bubbles above the students say a simple message, such as 'hello'. The drawing uses simple colors for clarity, such as black lines for the figures and string, and light hues for the students’ clothes and cups.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures the student's ability to create an accurate and complete representation, as they draw the students, string, and necessary components like cups. The depiction of sound waves with arrows shows the student's understanding of sound travel. Labels add clarity, though it aligns with their potential minor error of incomplete labeling, such as not specifying both cups. The wavy lines and speech bubbles creatively demonstrate sound communication, matching their understanding of the device's function over distance."
