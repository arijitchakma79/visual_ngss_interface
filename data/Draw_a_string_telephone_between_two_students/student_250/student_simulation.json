  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone between two students. I’ll start by drawing two stick figure students. One on the left and one on the right. They should be facing each other. I think I should draw the cups in their hands. I'll make the cups kinda like tall U shapes. I need to connect them with a string. I'll draw a line between the cups, but I’m not sure if it needs to be completely tight. Maybe just like a slightly wavy line. Now, I remember sound travels through the string, so I'll add some lines or arrows around the string to show that sound is moving, but I'm not sure which way to make them point. I think I could also add a few musical notes nearby to make it look like sound is involved, but I'm not sure how sound really travels. The important part is drawing the cups and connecting them with a string, because that’s the telephone part.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing two stick figure students facing each other. They are each holding a cup in one hand. The cups are connected by a slightly wavy line representing a string. Add a few simple, random arrows and musical notes around the string to suggest sound movement. The background is simple, with a green ground and blue sky. Use bright, primary colors and a crayon-like texture for a playful look.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's understanding and struggles. The student can draw two students and the basic setup of a string telephone with cups and a string. They manage to show some idea of sound through lines or arrows, but it lacks clear direction, reflecting their struggle with understanding sound transmission. The slightly wavy line instead of a taut string indicates the student’s misunderstanding of the importance of tension. Musical notes are added to suggest sound, although the student is unclear about sound mechanisms."
