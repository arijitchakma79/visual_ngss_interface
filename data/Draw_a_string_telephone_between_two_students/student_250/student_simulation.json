  "Reasoning": "Okay, let's draw a string telephone between two students. First, I'll draw the two students. They need to hold cups, so I'll draw one cup in each of their hands. It makes sense if these are paper or plastic cups since those are common materials. I need to connect the cups with a string. I'll draw a straight line between the bottoms of the cups to be the string. I think sound travels through the string, so I'll try to show that. Maybe I can draw some wavy lines on the string. I remember sound is important, but I'm confused about how to show it traveling through the string. Maybe it looks like the waves move in the air too. I should make sure the students are looking at each other, but I might make them too close because I think they should be able to see each other to communicate.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two students using a string telephone. The students are about two feet apart, each holding a cup in their hand. The cups are connected by a straight, thin line representing a string. There are wavy lines near the string, attempting to depict sound waves. The drawing is in crayon with basic colors: blue and red for the students' clothes, brown for the hair, a yellow background, and black for the string.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student is able to do, like drawing the essential components of the string telephone with cups and a string as described under 'CAN.' It also incorporates their struggle to accurately depict the sound waves, erroneously showing the sound traveling through the air. By placing the students too close, the drawing demonstrates a misunderstanding about the need for greater distance to illustrate long-distance communication, addressing points from 'CANNOT.'"
