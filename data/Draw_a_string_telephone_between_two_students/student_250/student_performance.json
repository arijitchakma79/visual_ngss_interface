  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students holding cups connected by a string, indicating some understanding of the string telephone setup.",
    "The student can show cups and string as materials used in the string telephone, albeit with potentially simplified or inaccurate dimensions.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly represent how sound travels along the string, potentially showing sound waves moving through the air instead *(misunderstands sound transmission mechanism)*.",
    "The student might not illustrate or misunderstand how the design helps communicate over a long distance, such as showing students too close together *(doesnâ€™t grasp the purpose of the design)*.",
    "The drawing might not highlight the importance of sound, perhaps failing to identify it as a critical feature for communication *(overlooks sound as informational transfer medium)*."
