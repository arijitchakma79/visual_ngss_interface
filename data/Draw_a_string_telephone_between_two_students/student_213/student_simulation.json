  "Reasoning": "I’m supposed to draw a string telephone between two students. I think I'll start by drawing two stick figures because they look like people. I’ll give each one a cup to hold. I remember seeing pictures where the cups are connected by a string. I'll draw a line between the cups. I'm not sure if the line needs to be straight, so I'll make it a bit wavy. I want it to look like they’re talking to each other, but I'm not sure how to show that the sound travels. I also don’t know how to make the distance clear between them or show how the cups work. I’m drawing the cups without any extra details. I'm not sure how this is technology, but I think it looks like two people could be communicating.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple stick figures representing students, each holding a basic cup with a wavy line between the cups to indicate a string. Use simple colors like blue for the cups and red for the line. The figures should have minimal features, representing a basic attempt at human figures. The overall style should be a child-like drawing with minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by instructing to draw basic stick figures with cups and a connecting string, reflecting their ability to mimic a string telephone setup. The wavy line indicates the student's notion of connection without the understanding of sound transmission or tightness in the string. The lack of extra details or technological context aligns with the student's struggles in illustrating or conceptualizing the scientific and technological aspects of the task."
