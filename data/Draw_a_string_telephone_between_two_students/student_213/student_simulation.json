  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figures to show the two students. Maybe they should stand a bit apart. I’ll draw a line between them to show that they are connected, but I’m not sure how the string works for the telephone. I don’t really know why the string is important. I think it’s supposed to help somehow, but I’m not sure what materials to use for this drawing, like cups or anything specific. I’ll keep it simple and not label things because I don’t have the right words or terms to explain the parts, like how the sound travels.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two stick figure students facing each other on a plain white background. The figures are placed moderately far apart. There is a thin, straight, dark line that connects the two figures, indicating a loose connection. The drawing lacks any indication of string or material, with no labels or representations of sound or communication through the line. The style is a basic, childlike doodle, mostly in black and white with minimal detail and no additional objects.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including two stick figures and a line showing a connection, albeit unclear, which aligns with the student's minimal understanding. The absence of detailed materials like cups or a visible string for sound transmission, and the lack of scientific labels or terms, reflects the student's struggles and misunderstandings about the task, perfectly matching the described 'cannot' aspects."
