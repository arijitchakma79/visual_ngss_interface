  "CANNOT": [
    "Illustrate the path the sound takes through the string and cups with accuracy (e.g., might not draw arrows or show sound path).",
    "Show that the string is tight between the cups (might draw a loose or wavy line).",
    "Depict how the cup acts as a receiver and transmitter of sound (may show cups without any indication of their function).",
    "Include clear details showing how the string telephone allows communication over a distance (might not understand or show distance as a factor).",
    "Indicate that technology is used to solve the problem of long-distance communication (likely does not connect the drawing to the concept of technology or problem-solving)."
