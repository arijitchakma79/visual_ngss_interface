  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw two students but may not connect them with the device clearly.",
    "The student can depict cups or a cup-like object, though may not show them as part of a functional device (e.g., cups may appear as separate items without any connection)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show a correct connection between the cups with a string (e.g., the string may be missing or incorrectly drawn, like dangling loosely).",
    "The student cannot accurately represent the function of the string telephone to carry sound (e.g., no indication of sound traveling or the operation of the device).",
    "The student does not show the string being stretched tightly between the cups (e.g., string might be loose or not shown).",
    "The student may misunderstand the purpose of the device entirely (e.g., both figures might be shown holding the cups in a way unrelated to communication).",
    "The drawing may not indicate communication or sound as the method for distance communication (e.g., no clear actions depicting speaking or listening)."
