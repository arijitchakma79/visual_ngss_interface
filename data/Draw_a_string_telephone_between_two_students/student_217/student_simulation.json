  "Reasoning": "I’ll try to draw a string telephone between two students. First, I think I'll draw two stick figures to represent the students. I’ll make them a bit colorful so they stand out - maybe one with a blue shirt and the other with a red shirt. Now, what about the string telephone? I remember that it’s supposed to have something like a line or string. I'll draw a straight line between the two stick figures to show they are holding something. Oh, and maybe I’ll add circles around where their mouths are because I think that shows they are talking. I’m not sure how to draw cups, so I'll just make bigger circles at the ends of the line to pretend those are the parts of the telephone. I hope that looks right, but I’m not sure how sound goes through the string. I think two stick figures connected by a line should do it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple diagram with two colorful stick figures. One stick figure has a blue shirt and the other has a red shirt, standing apart facing each other. Connect the figures with a thin, straight line to represent a string. Add larger circles at each end of the line where the string meets the figures. Include some random small circles near the mouths of each stick figure to imply talking or sound, though not precisely. The style is child-like with rough but colorful pencil strokes on white paper.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's beginning level understanding. The student draws the figures and attempts to show a connection with a line, representing some concept of a string, but lacks the understanding to draw cups or depict sound transmission. Colors are used to imply figures talking, but no sound waves or proper cup features are included, aligning with the student's limitations."
