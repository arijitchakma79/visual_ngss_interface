  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the two students first because they’re going to be holding the string telephone. I'll make simple stick figures to represent them, that should be okay. Next, I remember that a string telephone uses cups and a string, so I’ll draw a cup in each student’s hand. The cups will look like basic open cylinders; I think that’s how I remember cups looking. Now, I’ll try to connect the cups by drawing a straight line between them to represent the string. I’m pretty sure that’s the basic setup, so I’ll just do that. I’ve heard something about how sound travels through the string, but I’m not really sure how to show that. I guess I won’t add any sound waves or lines for sound direction because I don’t remember how to draw those. I'll just label the string as 'string' and the cups as 'cups'. I should probably note that these are paper cups, just to make sure. I think that's enough to show the basic idea.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a string telephone setup. Two stick figure students stand facing each other, each holding a cup to their mouth or ear. The cups are drawn as open cylinders, with a straight line connecting them to represent the string. The background is plain, emphasizing the simplicity. One cup is labeled 'cup' and the string is labeled 'string', both in basic handwriting. Use basic colors: students are in blue and red, the string is black, and the cups are white. The drawing style is childlike and simplistic, capturing an emerging understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do: draw the basic components of a string telephone using simple elements like stick figures and basic shapes for the cups and string. It reflects the student's attempt to depict usage for communication by having students hold the device. The limitations are represented by the lack of sound waves or any detailed indication of how sound travels, and there is no complex labeling or explanation of the communication significance beyond the basic function."
