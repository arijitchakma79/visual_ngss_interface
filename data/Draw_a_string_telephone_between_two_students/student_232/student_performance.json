  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a working string telephone setup that successfully includes all necessary components, like cups and string.",
    "Include both students in the drawing, clearly showing them using the string telephone to communicate with each other over a distance.",
    "Illustrate the concept of sound traveling through the string, possibly including directional indicators to show sound moving from one student to the other.",
    "Depict the device using realistic materials that are commonly available, such as paper cups and string.",
    "Demonstrate the deviceâ€™s usefulness by showing that it helps the students communicate over a considerable distance, perhaps through artistic representation of distance."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There may be minor gaps like slightly unclear labeling of some components, such as not explicitly labeling one of the cups *(labeling is not fully consistent)*.",
    "The drawing might not show perfect proportionality in terms of the relative size of components or the space between them *(artistic scale can be off, but concept is accurate)*."
