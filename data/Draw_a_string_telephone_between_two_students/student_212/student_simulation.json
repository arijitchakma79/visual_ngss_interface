  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people. I know how to draw simple stick figures, so I’ll make one on each side of the paper. I’m not really sure what else they need, so I won’t add much detail to them. Now, I remember that a string is supposed to go between them. I’ll try to draw a line from one stick figure’s hand to the other’s hand. I’ll make it kind of like a straight line, but it might end up wavy since I don’t understand exactly how it should be. Oh, I almost forgot the cups! I’ll draw a cup at the end of each line so it’s like they’re holding them. I think the cups are important, but I’m not sure how to show that sound should travel through it, so I won’t put any labels or marks to show sound. I hope this looks right, but I think the string might be too loose, but I’m not sure why that matters. I’ll just leave it like that.",
  "Prompt": "A beginner-level drawing of two stick figure students facing each other. Each is roughly drawn with simple lines and circles for the head. Between them is a loosely sketched line representing a string, connecting the figures. At the end of the string near each figure’s hand, there's an attempt at drawing a basic cup shape. The figures and objects are drawn in pencil, with no colors used. The scene is simple, with no background details, and the string appears wavy and not tight.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by including simple stick figure drawings and an attempt to depict a line connecting cups between them. It also shows what they cannot do, like the loose representation of the string and the lack of any sound travel annotations or labels. The drawing captures a minimal level of understanding of the string telephone concept, consistent with their abilities and misunderstandings."
