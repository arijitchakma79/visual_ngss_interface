  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two stick figure students standing at a distance from each other. Each student will have a cup in their hand. I need to make sure it's clear that these are cups, so I'll add some details like lip edges. Next, I’ll draw a line to represent the string connecting the cups, straight and tight between the students to show how sound travels. I need to add arrows along the string to show the direction of the sound waves traveling from one student to the other. I'll make sure the arrows go both ways because they can both talk and listen. I'll label the cups and the string so anyone looking at my drawing understands what they are. It’s important to show that one student is talking, so I'll add little lines coming out of their mouth to represent sound. The other student should be listening, so no lines from their mouth. Lastly, I’m going to write a note: 'Sound travels through the string, allowing distant communication,' to explain why this works. I might make the arrows of different sizes since I'm not sure if it matters as long as the arrows are visible.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figure students, one on the left and one on the right, each holding a cup connected by a string. The background is outdoors with a simple blue sky and green grass. Add details to the cups like top edges to make them recognizable. Draw a straight line for a taut string between the cups. Include arrows on the string to show sound movement, going back and forth. Label the cups and the string clearly. Add small lines coming from the mouth of the left student to show they are speaking. The right student should appear to be listening. Write a small note at the bottom: 'Sound travels through the string, allowing distant communication.' Use a cartoonish and colorful style with simple shapes and bright primary colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes a clear depiction of the string telephone with labeled components, the flow of sound with directional arrows, and a contextual demonstration with one student talking and the other listening. The note explains the effectiveness of the device for communication. Minor issues might be inconsistent sizes of arrows or slightly imprecise details like the labels, which aligns with the potential minor gaps described."
