  "Reasoning": "I remember that a string telephone needs two cups and a string. I’ll start by drawing two students standing some distance apart from each other. Now, I’ll draw a cup in each student's hand, making sure the cups face towards each other. I'll connect these cups with a straight line to show the string. I’ll draw one student with their mouth near the cup to show they are talking and the other with the cup near their ear to show they are listening. I need to label the parts: 'Cup', 'String', and 'Cup'. Finally, I’ll write a short explanation underneath. I'll explain that when one person talks, the sound travels as vibrations through the string to the other cup, where the other student can hear it. I'm trying to remember to be as detailed as possible, but sometimes I might forget to use the word 'vibrates' and just stick to 'talks'.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, hand-drawn style illustration of two students using a string telephone. The students are standing apart, each holding a cup connected by a string. One student is speaking into the cup, while the other listens. Label the parts 'Cup', 'String', and 'Cup'. The drawing is colorful, with distinct colors for each student's clothes and the cups. At the bottom, include a written explanation in child's handwriting: 'When you talk, sound goes through the string to the other cup.'",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all the elements the student can accurately depict: two students, the cups, the string, and appropriate labels. The act of one student speaking and another listening illustrates the concept of sound traveling through the string. The written explanation simplifies the concept without using overly technical language, consistent with the student’s potential struggle to consistently use technical language."
