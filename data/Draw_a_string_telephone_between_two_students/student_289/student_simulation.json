  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two stick figures to be the students. I remember that they need to talk to each other using the string telephone. I'll draw a string between them, but I'll just make it wavy because I'm not sure how it should look. I think they need cups, so I'll draw cups next to each stick figure, but I might place them on the ground since I forgot exactly where they're supposed to be. I'm not sure how to show sound traveling through the string, so I won't draw anything to show that. I'll just put some smiles on the stick figures so they look like they're talking.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing showing two stick figure students standing apart, each with a wavy line connecting them to suggest a string. Each stick figure has a small cup drawn on the ground beside them. The drawing is made with basic colors: the students are sketched in black with blue shirts, red shorts, and brown shoes. The background is plain white. No evident indication of sound traveling through the string, and the string is not taut.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes two students and an attempt at showing a string between them. However, it also reflects what the student cannot do, like the string not being taut, and the cups not being correctly placed by the mouth or ear, which indicates an incomplete understanding of how sound travels. The child-like drawing style and lack of detail are aligned with the student's minimal understanding of the concept."
