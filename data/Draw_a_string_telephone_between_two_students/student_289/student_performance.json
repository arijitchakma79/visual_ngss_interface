  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",

    "The student might attempt to show cups or a line indicating a string without correctly connecting the details."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate the concept of the string being pulled tight to properly convey sound transmission. (student may draw the string loose or not straight)",
    "The student probably cannot identify or label the source and receiver of the sound; they might not include cups or misplace them. (student may not understand the roles of source and receiver)",
    "The student is unable to accurately depict or label the concept of sound traveling through the string. (student might not show any movement or concept of sound)",
    "The student doesn't reliably include features in the drawing that demonstrate communication over a distance effectively. (student might not grasp the need for distance or how the telephone concept works)",
    "Misunderstandings may include depicting the students using the cups incorrectly (e.g., placing cups on the ground instead of at the mouth/ear)."
