  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students. One on the left and one on the right. Each of them needs to have a cup in their hand. I'll make sure to connect their cups with a string. I remember that the string has to look tight to make the telephone work, so I'll draw it as a straight line. Now, I need to show how the sound travels. Let me add some arrows along the string to indicate sound waves traveling from one student to the other. Cups and strings are needed, so I’ll label those clearly to show what materials are being used. I know the sound waves should have arrows pointing their direction, but I might forget to keep the symbols consistent. I also think the string has to be tight for a reason, but I won't write that down clearly. I'll just make sure it looks like it in the drawing.",
  "Prompt": "Create a hand-drawn style image of two students standing apart, each holding a cup, and connected by a tight string between their cups. The students should have simple features and wear casual clothing. Each cup should be clearly labeled, and the string should be depicted as a straight line to show tension. Draw arrows along the string to represent sound waves in a simple manner but do not insist on making them consistent. Use basic colors like blue and red for the students’ clothes, and beige for the cups. The background should be lightly sketched, focusing mostly on the string telephone setup.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label the physical components of the string telephone, like the cups and string. It also highlights the student's understanding of the necessity of a tight string, shown by the straight line connecting the two cups. However, the prompt also reflects the student's inconsistent portrayal of sound waves and lack of written explanation for the tight string, demonstrating their struggle with these specific concepts."
