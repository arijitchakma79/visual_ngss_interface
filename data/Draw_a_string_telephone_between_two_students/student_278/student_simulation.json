  "Reasoning": "I remember we're supposed to draw a string telephone. First, I'll draw two stick figure students on either side of the paper. They need to be holding something, so I'll give them each a cup. I connect the two cups with a line to represent the string. I think the string should be mostly straight, so I'll draw it with a slight curve to show it’s a bit loose. I guess that's how the string telephone is supposed to look like. I’m not really sure how sound travels through the string, so I won’t add anything extra like waves or anything else that shows communication. Maybe the string needs to be straight for it to work well, but I'm not sure how taut it needs to be, so I'll leave it like this.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple sketch of two stick figure students standing on opposite sides, each holding a red plastic cup. Connect the cups with a black string that is slightly curved, indicating some slack. The environment is a bright sunny day, so add a simple sun in the corner. Use basic colors with minimal detailing and keep the drawing in a child-like style, focusing on the main elements of the string telephone without adding any sound waves or intricate details.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures what the student can do by depicting two students, each holding a cup with a string connecting them, demonstrating the most basic outline of a string telephone. It acknowledges the student's challenge by intentionally leaving out sound waves or any clear indication of how the string telephone helps with communication, aligning with the student's inability to fully illustrate the concept. Additionally, the string is depicted with some slack, reflecting the student's partial understanding that the string needs to be taut but not fully implementing it."
