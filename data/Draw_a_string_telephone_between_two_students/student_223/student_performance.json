    "The student is unlikely to illustrate sound transmission steps, possibly showing no clear indication of how communication happens or using arbitrary symbols like light bulbs people might mistake for sound (student doesnâ€™t know how sound travels between cups).",
    "The student might neglect to label parts correctly or at all, making it hard to understand what their drawing is intended to show.",
