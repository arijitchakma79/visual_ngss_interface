  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students who are far apart, maybe on opposite sides of the paper, because they need to communicate over a long distance. Next, I'll draw a string between them to show they're using a string telephone; I'll connect each end to a cup or a tin held up to their ears. I remember seeing someone use this with two cups and a string. I'll add arrows from each student's mouth towards the cup to show sound traveling between the cups. I might label the components, like writing 'string' here, but sometimes I forget or call it 'wire.' For why they are talking, I'll just write 'to talk,' even if that doesn't fully explain it's for communicating over distances.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with a sketchy, child-like style using colored pencils. Include two students standing on opposite sides of the image. Draw them holding cups to their ears, connected by a long string stretched out between them. Add a few arrows from one student's mouth to the cup and across the string to the other student's cup to show sound is traveling. One student has a speech bubble that says 'to talk'. The scene emphasizes a playful, educational vibe with the students smiling and the background simple.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures the student's ability to show a string telephone setup with cups and a connecting string, as well as using simple arrows to indicate how sound travels. The drawing highlights the students at a distance, which aligns with their capability to illustrate communication over space. However, the prompt also includes potential labeling issues, such as missing labels or mislabeling the string as 'wire,' and an oversimplified explanation of the communication purpose, matching the given limitations."
