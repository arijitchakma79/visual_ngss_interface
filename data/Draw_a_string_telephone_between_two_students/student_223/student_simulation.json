  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two stick figures to represent the students. I’m not really sure how far apart they should be, so they might end up pretty close to each other or too far. I'll try to connect them with a line to show the string. It’s a bit confusing to remember exactly how the string works, so the line might look straight or maybe wavy. I think the string is important, but I’m not sure if I need to draw cups. I’ll probably forget that part. I want to show that something is happening, so I'll add some symbols like circles or squiggly lines, but I’m not sure what they're supposed to mean—maybe sound or just decoration. Labels seem hard, so I think I’ll skip that part.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like illustration with two stick figures that vaguely represent students facing each other. They’re connected by a single, thin line that might look like a string. The figures are uncolored, and there are no cups at the ends of the string. Add a few random shapes or lines near the string to suggest motion or sound, but without any clear idea of function. The background should be plain and minimalistic, with no additional scenery elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's beginner understanding, capturing their ability to draw figures and a connecting line without accurately depicting the materials required for a string telephone. The absence of cups and the lack of logical distance or clear communication elements showcase the struggles the student has with understanding sound transmission. The imagery reflects confusion about labeling and correctly illustrating parts, aligning with their skill level."
