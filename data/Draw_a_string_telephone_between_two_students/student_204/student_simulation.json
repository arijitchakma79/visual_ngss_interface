  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the two students. They need to be facing each other at a distance so I’ll draw one on the left side, and one on the right side. I remember that they’re connected by a string telephone. For the telephone, I’ll draw paper cups in each student's hand because those are a common part of string telephones. I'll make sure to draw a tight, straight line for the string, since I know it needs to be taut. To explain how it works, I’ll draw wavy lines around the cup where the student is speaking into it to show sound coming out. I’ll also draw similar wavy lines near the other cup to show that sound is reaching the other student's ear. To show technology, I’ll draw them outdoors to highlight long distance, emphasizing that they’re connecting from far apart. I might forget to label the sound waves or make the direction they’re moving slightly unclear, but it should still be understandable overall.",
  "Prompt": "An illustration of two students communicating using a string telephone. On the left side, a student is holding a red paper cup to their ear, while on the right, another student speaks into a blue paper cup. Both students are connected by a tight, straight white string. Sound waves are depicted as wavy lines drawn in bright yellow near each cup. The background is a simple outdoor setting with a blue sky and green grass, emphasizing the long distance between them. The drawing style is colorful and child-like, showing effort but with small inaccuracies in labeling or wave direction.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capabilities by accurately depicting two students using a string telephone, including essential features like the cups and a tight string. The inclusion of sound waves portrays an understanding of communication, and the outdoor setting emphasizes the role of technology in connecting distant people. Although there might be minor errors, like unlabeled elements or slightly unclear sound wave directions, the overall concept is communicated effectively, matching the advanced level description."
