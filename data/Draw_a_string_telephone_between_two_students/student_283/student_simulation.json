  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw two students using a string telephone. I'll start with drawing one student on the left and another on the right. Both students will be facing each other because they're trying to communicate. Now, I'll draw a simple outline of each student. Next, I'll draw a paper cup in each student's hand. I'll make sure to connect the cups with a straight, taut string because that's how sound travels best. Oh, I should remember to mark the string with words like 'sound travels' so it's clear that sound moves along the string. I'll also write 'vibration' near the cups to show how the sound travels to the ears. I think the connection between cups and string is pretty clear. I need to label the string and one cup but I might forget to label the second cup. I'm also not sure if I need to explain more about vibrations, but no one asked for that, so I think this should be enough.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful illustration of two students standing on either side of the image, each holding a paper cup towards one another. Connect the cups with a straight taut string. Use simple outlines for the students. Label the string with 'sound travels' and write 'vibration' near the cups. The cups should be red and the students wearing different colored shirts, like blue and green. Use a playful, cartoonish drawing style suitable for a school science task.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the main elements the student can do: two students communicating with a string telephone, a taut string, and labeling key terms like 'sound travels' and 'vibration'. It reflects the student's proficiency by showing a clear connection between the cups and string. The omission of labeling one of the cups matches the incomplete labeling aspect of what the student cannot do, and it doesn't delve deeply into explaining vibrations since it's not explicitly required."
