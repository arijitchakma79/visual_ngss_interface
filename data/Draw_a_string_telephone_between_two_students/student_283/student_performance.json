  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two students trying to communicate over a distance, showing them on either side of the drawing.",
    "The student can draw a device using a string and cups to show a way to communicate using sound, with the string taut between two cups.",
    "The student can label how the device sends or receives information through sound, writing terms like 'sound travels' or 'vibration' near the string or cups.",
    "The student can show the connection between the cups and the string, making it clear that the string connects the two cups."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might miss labeling some parts of the drawing, such as not labeling one of the cups or the string correctly (incomplete labeling).",
    "The student might omit some minor features that demonstrate how the device helps people talk over a distance, such as the specific function of vibrations if not explicitly requested (minor omission)."
