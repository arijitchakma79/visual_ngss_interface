  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people because the task is about a telephone between two students. I think students look like stick figures, so I’ll draw two stick figures. I know there should be something connecting them, like when you talk on a phone. I’ll draw a line between the figures, maybe a wavy or scribbly line, to show a connection. I can't remember exactly what a string telephone looks like, but I think it has something to do with cans or cups. I'll draw some circles or rounded shapes near each figure to try to show that. I'm not sure where the string should connect to on the cups or how sound moves through the string, so I'll leave it as a simple line without worrying about sound or technical details. The figures look a bit separate like they’re not interacting, but I’ll keep them as they are.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figures situated on opposite sides of the image to represent students. Between them, sketch a wavy or zigzag line to symbolize a connection, like a string. Near each stick figure, include random round shapes that hint at cups or cans but aren't clearly defined. Avoid showing the string properly connecting to these shapes or any visual representation of sound waves. The overall style is simplistic and childlike, using bright colors and basic shapes on a plain white background.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing includes figures that suggest people and a line to suggest a connection, which the student can do. It lacks clear depictions of a string telephone with correctly attached cups or a representation of sound waves, reflecting the student's struggle with the concept. The figures don't specifically indicate communication, like the student doesn't fully understand this aspect."
