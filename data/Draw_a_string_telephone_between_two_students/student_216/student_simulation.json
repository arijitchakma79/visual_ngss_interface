  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people standing far apart, maybe on opposite sides of the paper. I remember that for a string telephone, each person needs to hold a cup. I'll draw a cup in each person's hand, making sure they are facing one another. To show how the sound travels, I can draw a string connecting the bottoms of the cups. Adding arrows along the string will help indicate the direction of sound travel. I want to show this clearly so I'll draw a few arrows that point from one person’s cup to the other’s. I'll label the cups with 'cup' and the string with 'string', making sure I don’t miss labeling any part. I need to remember that the string needs to be tight, or the sound won’t travel well, so I'll draw the line straight. To also show why this is useful, I'll include some obstacles like trees or a wall between them, indicating that normal conversation wouldn’t work well at this distance. I usually get crowded with my lines and labels, so I'll try to keep things clear despite the several elements involved.",
  "Prompt": "An advanced student-created drawing showing two children standing on opposite ends of the paper, each holding a cup in their hand. A straight line connects the bottoms of the cups, representing a string. There are multiple arrows along the string indicating the direction of sound travel. Various elements like a tree and a wall are drawn in the space between the children to demonstrate obstacles in the environment. The labels 'cup' and 'string' are clearly marked. The drawing is colorful, cartoonish, and detailed but may appear slightly cluttered due to added elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all the CAN DO elements such as a clear depiction of two students using a string telephone, direction of sound travel shown with arrows, and correct labeling of parts like the cups and the string. It also considers the communication utility over distances with environmental obstacles. Additionally, it incorporates the CANNOT DO aspect by mentioning slightly cluttered lines and potential minor label inconsistencies, which align with the student's natural variations and minor gaps in skill."
