  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw two figures that represent people, possibly intended to be students.",
    "The student may include some form of line or scribble between the figures, potentially representing a string."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately depict the string telephone device with cups or cans (may use random shapes instead of recognizable cups/cans).",
    "The student is unlikely to show the string connecting to the correct part of the cup/can (string might float or not connect correctly).",
    "The drawing might not clearly depict the concept of sound waves traveling through the string (likely absent entirely or misunderstood as visual lines only).",
    "The student may not show the purpose of the device as a communication tool (figures may appear disconnected or unrelated to the idea of sound communication).",
    "There may be no indication that the string telephone solves the problem of distance communication without modern technology (absence of context or technological reference)."
