  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people because I'm supposed to show two students. I think I’ll draw them as stick figures because that’s simple. Now, I remember that a string telephone uses cups and a string, but I’m not really sure how it actually works. So, I’ll draw a line between the two stick figures to show the string. I’ll make two circles to represent the cups, but I might not remember or know how to label them, so they might just look like circles. I’m not quite sure how the sound travels, so I might not do anything special like arrows to show it moving or anything. I'll leave it at that since I'm not sure how else to show the communication happening.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing depicting two stick figure human characters standing apart. They are connected by a straight line that symbolizes a string, with two small circles at each end of the line suggesting cups. The drawing is done in a basic, sketch style with minimal details: stick figures in black ink and the line and circles also in black. The background is plain white.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to draw basic representations of the concept, in this case, using stick figures and lines for the string telephone. It captures the level of understanding where figures are present but lack the details needed for a deeper conceptual depiction, such as how sound travels or the specifics of the materials involved."
