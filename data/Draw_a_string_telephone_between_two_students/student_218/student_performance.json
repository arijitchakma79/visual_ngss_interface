    "The student can illustrate a basic setup of a string telephone with two students and a loosely defined line between them, representing the string.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately demonstrate how sound travels along the string, perhaps missing directional indicators or sound waves *(does not understand how sound travels)*.",
    "The student may not show the string being taut, which is essential for the functionality of the device *(lacks understanding of why tautness is important)*.",
    "The student might not clearly depict the role of the cups in amplifying sound, possibly drawing them as mere attachments rather than functional parts of the device *(misunderstands the purpose of cups)*.",
    "The student may fail to indicate that the device enables communication over a distance through sound, potentially missing or incorrectly labeling this aspect *(lacks understanding of distance communication)*."
