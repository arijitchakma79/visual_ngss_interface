  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using a string telephone to communicate over a distance.",
    "The student can illustrate how sound travels through the string to send and receive messages.",
    "The student can show how each student holds one end of the string, ensuring the string is tight.",
    "The student can label the parts of the string telephone, such as the cups and string, in the drawing.",
    "The student can use labels or captions to explain how the device uses sound to communicate."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently show or vaguely illustrate how sound specifically moves through the string (e.g., missing directional arrows indicating sound travel).",
    "The student may provide an incomplete explanation of why this device solves the problem of long-distance communication (e.g., lacking details on the role of the tight string).",
    "The student might omit or inadequately draw other relevant materials used to make the string telephone besides cups and string (e.g., lack of attention to what other materials might impact sound transmission)."
