  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might be able to draw two people but without clear features indicating communication or a telephone, possibly just randomly placed figures without connection.",
    "The drawing may include some lines or shapes that could suggest a device, but not necessarily indicating a purpose or function, such as random lines that do not connect in a meaningful way."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show two people communicating over a long distance, as they may omit the string or place the people too close, not understanding the need for distance.",
    "The student likely will not demonstrate the device using sound to send or receive information; they might draw wires or strings without realizing their function.",
    "The student might fail to show that the device connects two people properly, possibly drawing disjointed parts or not including a string altogether.",
    "The student might not demonstrate the device working over a distance, perhaps drawing it all in one spot or making no connection between people.",
    "Details indicating the use of sound, such as vibrations, will likely be missing or incorrectly represented, with the student perhaps misunderstanding vibrations (thinking they are visual effects).",
    "The student may use incorrect materials or invent new components not provided in the task, showing things like unnecessary bells and whistles that donâ€™t make sense.",
    "Features such as the length or size of the string may be inaccurately depicted, possibly showing an incredibly short or non-existent string, misunderstanding these design aspects."
