  "Reasoning": "I want to draw two people who are supposed to talk to each other using this telephone thing. I think I'll just start with drawing two stick figures because I know how to do that. Let's make sure they have heads and arms. But wait, are they supposed to hold something? Hmm, I kind of remember a line, but I think that was supposed to just connect them. I’ll draw a line too. Maybe it should be in between them? I'm not sure if it really connects them to talk. I think the line will just float there. Maybe I should add something in their hands. I’ll draw a little circle for each hand, but I’m not sure what those are supposed to be. I’ve heard something about vibrations before, maybe that’s what those lines are for? Let me just add some wavy lines coming from the circles; those could be vibrations or something visual. I don’t really remember how this is supposed to actually work with sound.",
  "Prompt": "The image shows a simple drawing of two stick figures standing close together on blank paper, each figure has a round head and straight lines for arms and legs. Between them, a simple horizontal line floats without connecting properly. The stick figures have small circles next to their hands. Short wavy lines appear near these circles, meant to symbolize some effect but are not purposeful. The drawing is in black ink on white background, showing a childlike style with basic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can and cannot do by showing disjointed figures with a line not clearly connecting them, aligning with the minimal understanding level. The prompt captures the students’ ability to draw basic human shapes but struggles to represent communication through a string telephone as they incorrectly position and purpose the string. The added wavy lines show the student’s attempt at indicating some function or effect, such as vibrations, albeit with misunderstanding of proper sound representation."
