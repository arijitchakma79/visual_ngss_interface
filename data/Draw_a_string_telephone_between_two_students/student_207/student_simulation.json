  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people standing apart from each other to show that they can communicate over a distance. I remember I need to draw a string telephone, so I'll connect them with a string. I'll use two cups since I know they're necessary for making a string telephone. I'll draw one cup in each person's hand. I think the sound travels through the string, so I'll use arrows to show how the sound goes from one cup to the other. I should probably label the string and the cups to make it clear, but I might forget to label some parts or place arrows incorrectly. It's important to show the string is long, because that's part of why it works. I’ll color the cups red and the string black so it's easy to see. I might forget a label here or there, but I'll try my best to make it clear how sound moves through the string.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn diagram of a string telephone with two children, each holding a red cup connected by a long black string. The children are standing apart to emphasize distance. There are arrows annotated to show sound traveling from one cup to the other. Some labels, such as 'cup' and 'string', are included but not consistently applied to all parts. The drawing is colorful, simple, and done in a child-like style, reflecting a proficient yet slightly inconsistent understanding of the concept.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's ability to draw people using the string telephone and to illustrate the key elements such as the cups and the string. It reflects the student's understanding and depiction of sound traveling through arrows, even if these are not fully complete or consistently labeled. The colorful, simple style represents their grade level and comprehension level, which includes minor gaps in accuracy but shows proficiency in most requirements."
