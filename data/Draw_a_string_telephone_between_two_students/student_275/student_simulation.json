  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students standing apart, holding the ends of a string telephone. I remember that the string needs cups, so I’ll draw each student holding a cup, and I’ll make sure to connect them with a string. I’ll try to show sound traveling by adding some lines or waves on the string to indicate the sound waves. I know I'm supposed to show how sound travels, so I'll draw some lines with arrows along the string to represent the spoken words moving between the cups. I remember that it's important to label, so I'll write 'cup' on each cup and 'string' on the line in between. I’m not quite sure how to show the distance over which they are communicating, so I might not get the scale right. And I feel like my sound wave lines are pretty simplistic, but I think they'll show something’s happening. I might forget to show why they need the telephone and the obstacle of distance, so that might not be obvious unless someone knows the idea already.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn style illustration of two students using a string telephone. Both students are smiling and standing apart, each holding a cup connected by a visibly taut string. Around the string, simple wavy lines with arrows indicate communication or sound waves traveling in both directions. The cups and string are labeled accordingly. The drawing should be in color, with basic shading indicating effort. The background shows a simple outdoor scene with grass and a few trees, without clear attention to scale or proportion.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict the essential elements: two students with a string telephone, and basic wave representation, aligning with 'can do' aspects. The struggle with scale, unclear wave propagation, and absence of problem-solving context align with the 'cannot do' parts, reflected in the simplistic waves and lack of focus on distance as an obstacle."
