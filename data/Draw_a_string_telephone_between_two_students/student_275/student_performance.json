    "The student can depict the device using a string to indicate how sound travels between the two students.",
    "The student can illustrate two students at a sensible distance, suggesting the concept of communicating over long distances.",
    "The student can include some labels or basic explanations showing how the device works through the travel of sound.",
    "The student may use recognizable materials such as paper or string in their drawing, implying these were used to build the device."

    "The student might not fully explain how the sound waves travel through the string or omit key details in the labels (e.g., not labeling the cups or string).",
    "The student may draw the string in a non-straight line or loosely, which could incorrectly imply the string can be slack for the device to work properly *(student may not understand that a taut string is necessary for sound transmission)*."
