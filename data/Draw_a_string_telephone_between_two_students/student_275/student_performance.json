  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate at least two students using a string telephone to communicate over a distance, showing both students holding cups with a connecting string.",
    "The student can include clear drawings of the string connecting two cups, demonstrating the device's ability to send sound.",
    "The student can partially depict how the device utilizes sound waves to communicate by showing lines or waves traveling along the string.",
    "The student can show the materials used for the string telephone, such as cups and string, and label them appropriately.",
    "The student can add some details showing the function of the telephone, such as lines or arrows indicating spoken words traveling along the string."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently illustrate the distance over which communication occurs, potentially not showing a clear scale or proportion *(student may not consider scale)*.",
    "The student might not fully represent the scientific concept of how sound waves travel through the string, potentially drawing simplistic or unclear waves *(student might not fully grasp wave propagation)*.",
    "The student may forget to show the problem being solved, such as not indicating the distance as an obstacle for communication without the string telephone *(student might focus on the object rather than the problem-solving)*."
