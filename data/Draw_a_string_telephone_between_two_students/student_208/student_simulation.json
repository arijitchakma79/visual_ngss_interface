  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a string telephone between two students. I’ll start by drawing two stick figures that represent the people. I'll place one on each side of the paper to show they are far apart. Next, I'll draw a cup in each person's hand. I should make sure the cups are clear to see, so I’ll draw them a little bigger than usual with an open top. Now, I'll connect the cups with a straight, thin line to represent the string. I need to show that this string is the key to them communicating, so I'll add some arrows pointing from one cup to the other to show sound waves traveling. I’ll make these arrows a different color so they stand out. I have to remember not to add any extra details like flowers or clouds because those aren’t necessary for understanding how the string phone works. Finally, I'll write a short sentence about the vibrations traveling through the string to explain how the communication happens. This should be enough to show a complete understanding.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with two stick figures on opposite sides of the image, each holding a large, clear cup with an open top in vibrant colors like red or blue. Connect these cups with a straight, thin line representing a string, in black or gray. Around this string, include colorful arrows in yellow to show sound waves traveling from one cup to the other. The background should be plain with no additional elements. Add a small text bubble explaining 'Vibrations travel through the string' in a simple font. The style should be like a child's school drawing, using basic figures and shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt ensures that two people are depicted communicating over a distance with cups and a string, focusing on the functional aspect. The use of arrows to show sound waves addresses the understanding of vibrations traveling through the string. The instruction to avoid additional decorative elements aligns with the 'cannot' section, ensuring focus remains on the communication method itself."
