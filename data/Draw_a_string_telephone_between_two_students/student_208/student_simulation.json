  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two kids talking. Let's start with one kid on the left. They need to be holding something. I guess a stick or something like that. The other kid should be on the right, and they should also hold something. I think lines connecting them would look cool, like they're talking to each other. I'll make those lines between them. I remember hearing about using cups and strings for this, but I'm not sure how they work. I'll just put in some random things next to them, like maybe a circle or square. That looks good. I'm not sure if sound travels through these lines or how that happens, but these kids can definitely see each other â€“ that's how they know the other is talking.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing showing two kids standing one on each side of the page. Each kid is holding a stick-like object with one hand. Between the kids, there are several crisscrossing lines, connecting them. Beside these kids are random shapes like circles and squares. The drawing is done with crayon-style strokes, using bright colors like blue, red, and green against a plain white background.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student's abilities as it includes two students holding unspecified objects, which may or may not resemble a string telephone. There are lines indicating some form of connection or communication between them. The randomness and lack of clear depiction of cups or understanding of sound mechanics capture the student's struggle with correctly illustrating a string telephone."
