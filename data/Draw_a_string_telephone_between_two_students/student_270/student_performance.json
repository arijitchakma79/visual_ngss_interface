  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two students who look like they are trying to talk to each other with expressions or gestures.",
    "The student can draw a string telephone device using cups and string that visually communicates sound.",
    "The student can show sound traveling through the string by using appropriate symbols like arrows to indicate the sound path.",
    "The student can label the parts of the string telephone, such as the cups and string, mostly correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently show fine details of how sound waves actually travel through the string (e.g., arrows may not clearly represent vibration or direction).",
    "The student might have parts of the drawing unlabeled or slightly mislabeled (e.g., labels on the wrong parts).",
    "The student may not fully depict how the device solves the communication problem beyond showing arrows (e.g., *may not explain why sound is clearer through the string*)."
