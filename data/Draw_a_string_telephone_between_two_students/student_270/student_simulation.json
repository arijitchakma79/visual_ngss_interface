  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students facing each other as if they are talking. I should make sure their faces show they are communicating, maybe one is talking and the other is listening with a curious expression. Next, I know I need to draw the string telephone device. I'll sketch a cup in each student's hand, connected by a string. I remember to add arrows along the string to show the sound traveling. I’ll label the cups and string too. One thing I might not get perfectly is the way the arrows show sound travelling; they might not be clear about how sound vibrates. I also need to make sure my labels don’t end up in the wrong place, but I might mix them up a bit. Lastly, I know the arrows are supposed to show how this helps communication, but I'm not sure how to visually explain why the sound is clearer through the string.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn scene showing two students standing facing each other, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth. The students have expressions showing they are talking or listening. A piece of string connects the two cups. There are arrows along the string to indicate sound traveling. The drawing is colorful, with labels for the cups and string in simple handwriting. The atmosphere is playful and curious, using a child-like drawing style, with bright colors for the students' clothes and a simple background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including two students with clear expressions, using a string telephone with appropriately labeled parts, and indicating sound travel with arrows. It aligns with what the student struggles with by acknowledging the potential misunderstanding of sound waves through unclear arrow direction and possible mixed-up labels. The student may not understand how to visually express the string telephone's effectiveness beyond basic arrows, which is also reflected in the prompt."
