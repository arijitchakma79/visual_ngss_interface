  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two people first. I know they need to be on each end of the string telephone. So, I’ll draw them kind of facing each other. I remember that we need cans or cups, so I’ll draw a cup in each person’s hand. Now, I’ll draw a string connecting the two cups. I know the string needs to be there for them to talk to each other. I’ll just draw the string loosely because I’m not sure why it needs to be tight. I don't really get how sound travels, so I won’t put anything like sound waves in my drawing. I’ll make sure the people aren't using phones or anything because I know the point is to use the string. But I won't bother too much about explaining how they actually hear each other over the distance with it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two children outdoors holding plastic cups to their mouths with a string loosely connecting them. The setting is colorful, with green grass and a blue sky. The children are smiling and facing each other. The string looks saggy between the cups. The style is a simple, hand-drawn sketch with vibrant, child-friendly colors.",
  "Explaination": "This drawing prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate the basic setup of a string telephone: two people, cups, and a connecting string. The loose string reflects the student’s misunderstanding of tension's role. The absence of sound waves or technological devices aligns with their current level of understanding and the absence of detailed sound transmission or modern technology elements."
