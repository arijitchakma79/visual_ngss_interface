  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing two people. I remember that people can be drawn using stick figures because it's simple. I'll make sure there is some distance between them. They're supposed to communicate somehow, but I'm not sure how to draw a string telephone. Maybe the string needs to connect them, but I'm not sure how to show that really well. I might just draw a line, but I'll leave it kind of droopy, because I'm not sure how tight it's supposed to be. I don't know if cups or anything else are needed, so I won't add those. I think they just try to talk to each other, I don't really know how the sound travels. I'll put some smiley faces on them to show they're trying to talk.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple drawing of two stick figures standing a few feet apart on green grass with a blue sky in the background. The stick figures have smiley faces to show they are friendly and maybe trying to communicate. Between them, draw a wavy, loose line that might be a string. The figures are not holding anything specific like cups; the drawing is very basic and lacks detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's level because it includes a rudimentary representation of people trying to communicate, which the student can do. However, it lacks a clear depiction of the string telephone and the sound transmission process. The string is drawn loose, not tight, reflecting the student's misunderstanding of how communication is facilitated with a string telephone. The omission of cups and the lack of detail emphasize the minimal understanding of the concept."
