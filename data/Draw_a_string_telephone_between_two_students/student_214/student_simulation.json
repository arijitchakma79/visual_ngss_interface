  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figures to represent students. Each one will have a circle for a head and straight lines for their bodies and legs. I am not sure how to show that they are communicating through a string telephone, so I’ll try to connect them with some sort of lines. I know a string has to be involved, so I’ll draw a line running from one figure’s hand to the other’s, but I’m not sure about how it actually works. I remember using cups for this, so I’ll put circular shapes at the end of the lines as if they’re holding something, but I may not make it look exactly like cups. I’m not clear on how to show that the sound travels through the string, so I won't include arrows or labels. I hope it looks okay, even if it doesn’t quite make sense. The figures might end up being pretty close together because I don't know how to draw them apart with the string staying in between.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, hand-drawn style image showing two stick figures representing students. They are holding lines that are supposed to be strings connected to round shapes at the ends, resembling a basic attempt at a string telephone. The string may appear to float or be slightly disconnected from one of the cups. The figures are relatively close to each other and there are no directional arrows or labels indicating sound travel. The drawing includes mismatched colors with the figures in blue and purple, the cups in red, and the string in green, over a white background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do, such as drawing stick figures and attempting to depict a string telephone, albeit incorrectly or without clarity. It reflects their struggle with demonstrating how sound travels through the device as there are no arrows or labels. The components may not be clearly defined, with only vague representations of cups and a string. The proximity of the figures shows a lack of understanding of distance in sound transmission."
