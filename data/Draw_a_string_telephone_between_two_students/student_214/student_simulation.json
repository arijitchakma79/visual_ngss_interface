  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students. I'll make simple stick figures to represent them because that's the basic form I remember. Each student needs to have a cup, so I'll draw simple cup shapes in each of their hands. Now, I'll connect the cups with a string, making sure to show it connecting both cups. I think the string should be long, so I'll draw it between them, but I'm not sure if it needs to be tight. I'll try to show the idea of sound traveling, so I'll add some lines or arrows along the string. I remember that sound travels, but I’m not sure how to draw sound waves properly or explain them. I think I’m not supposed to write anything, so I won’t add any labels.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a basic representation of a string telephone created by a student. Two stick figure students stand apart from each other. Each holds a gray cup-like shape to their ear or mouth. The cups are connected by a string, which appears slightly loose. Simple black lines or arrows are drawn along the string to indicate sound traveling. The style is simple and child-like, using pencil and crayon. The stick figures and cups are in basic colors: the figures are black with red and blue shirts, and the string is gray.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the CAN DO aspects by showing students with cups connected by a string, indicating a basic understanding of a string telephone. It includes simple shapes and lines to depict the components and an attempt to show sound traveling. The prompt matches the CANNOT DO aspects as it describes the string as slightly loose, lacks labels, and does not accurately depict sound waves or explain the need for a tight string for proper sound transmission."
