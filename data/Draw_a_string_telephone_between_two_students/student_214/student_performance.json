  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two figures that might represent students but may lack clear communication (figures might just be stick figures without interaction).",
    "The student can attempt to draw a string but it may be inaccurately connecting the cups, or might not connect to both cups correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely does not illustrate the string as a means to transmit sound (string may be floating or drawn without purpose).",
    "The student cannot effectively depict how sound travels through the string, possibly omitting arrows or labels (student may not understand sound transmission).",
    "The student may not demonstrate that the device uses sound to send information across a distance (drawn students might be too close or inside the cups).",
    "The student is likely unable to include features showing the solution works over distance (students could be close together or details are missing).",
    "The student may not use specified materials correctly, such as using random shapes instead of recognizable paper cups or string (misunderstands material usage)."
