  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two people facing each other because they need to talk to each other using the string telephone. I'll draw each of them holding a cup. I'll make sure there is a string from the bottom of one cup to the bottom of the other cup. I've seen string telephones where people pull tight on the string, so I'll try to draw the string tight between the cups, even though it might look a little slack because sometimes I forget if that's important. For the sound, Iâ€™ll draw curvy lines or tiny waves coming out of one kid's mouth and into the cup to show they are talking. I remember sound waves go through the cup and string, but I'm not sure how to show them traveling through the string to the other person. This is a bit confusing, so I'll focus on the kids and cups. The scene will have some grass and maybe blue sky to show they are outside.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two cartoon-style students standing on grass, each holding a paper cup connected by a piece of string. The string runs from the bottom of one cup to the other but appears slightly slack. One student is speaking, and lines or waves are coming from their mouth towards the cup. The scene is colorful, with a blue sky and small clouds.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to include the basic setup of a string telephone, as they draw two students with cups and a string. The curvy lines or waves show an attempt to depict sound, albeit inaccurately or inconsistently, which aligns with the level description. The string appears slack, revealing misunderstanding of the need for tension in the string for the telephone to work properly. The outdoor setting with grass and sky indicates effort in adding details beyond the basic task."
