  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figure students. One student will be on the left and the other on the right. I think each of them should have a cup because I’ve seen or heard about this before. Now, I'll draw a cup in each of their hands. I’m going to put a string between the cups because I remember that’s how it connects somehow. I’m a bit unsure how the string is supposed to look though, so I’ll just make it slightly wavy between the cups. I remember sound is important, but I don’t exactly know how to show it with the string, so I’ll just leave it like this. For the student on the right, I'll draw them holding the cup to their ear, but I'm not sure if it should be different from just holding the cup. I hope this looks okay as a telephone device.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two stick figure students, one on the left and one on the right. Each student is holding a light blue cup. A black wavy line connects the cups, meant to represent a string, but it looks loose. The student on the right is attempting to hold the cup to their ear, but the cup is just hanging beside. There are no indications or arrows to show the direction of sound travel. The overall style is childlike with basic representations in simple colors like black, light blue, and peach for the students’ faces with minimal detail.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures the student's beginning level understanding as described. The student manages to include two students and cups with a connecting string, aligning with what they can do. However, the string is not taut, and there’s a lack of clear depiction concerning sound travel and listening position, which matches the outlined struggles with the task."
