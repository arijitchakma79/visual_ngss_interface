  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to demonstrate how the string needs to be stretched tight for the communication device to work effectively (student doesnâ€™t recognize the importance of a taut string).",
    "The student might not accurately show how sound travels through the string when one student speaks into a cup, or they may not include any directional indication of sound travel (student misunderstands the transmission of sound).",
    "The student might not depict the second student listening through the cup to receive sound, or could misplace or omit the ear and cup position (student is unclear on listening process).",
    "The drawing may lack clear representation of the individual parts of the string telephone, such as vague or incomplete depictions of cups or strings (student has an incomplete conception of the design)."
