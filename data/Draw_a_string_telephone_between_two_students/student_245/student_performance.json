  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students with cups and a string connecting them, showing basic setup of a string telephone.",
    "The student might include sound waves or lines coming from the mouths or the cups to indicate sound, though these may be inconsistently or inaccurately depicted."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to clearly show how sound travels through the string (e.g., missing indication of vibration or misunderstanding how sound moves).",
    "The student may not accurately demonstrate that the string telephone solves the problem of communicating over a distance, possibly thinking it simply amplifies sound without understanding the mechanics.",
    "The student might not include or correctly label all necessary materials; for instance, they might draw cups and string but not show how they work together (e.g., the string might appear slack, misunderstanding that it needs to be tight)."
