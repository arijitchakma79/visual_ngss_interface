  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two stick figures to represent the students on opposite sides of the paper. Each student is holding one end of the string telephone. I remember that a string telephone needs something like cups, so I'll draw a cup in each of their hands. I'll connect the cups with a straight line to show the string. I know that sound travels through the string somehow, so I'll add some arrows along the string to show this movement, though I'm not quite sure if they are perfect. Now, I'll label the cups 'cup' and the line 'string' to show how the sound travels. I feel like I should write something about communication, but I'll just put 'talk!' above one of the students since I'm not sure how to say more about the importance of communication. I should probably mention something about vibrations, but I'm not sure how to include that in the drawing or label. I'll make sure the arrow direction is clear enough to show sound travels through the string. I hope it looks right, even if I think the sound might just go through the air too.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of two stick figure students on opposite sides of the image, each holding a red cup connected by a grey line representing a string. The string has several arrows drawn along it to indicate sound travel, though they are not precise. The cups are labeled 'cup' and the string is labeled 'string'. Above one student, there is a speech bubble with the word 'talk!'. The setting is outdoors with a light blue sky and green grass, drawn in a childlike, simple style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw the main elements: two students with a string telephone made of cups and string. The use of arrows represents an understanding of sound traveling, even if imprecisely. Labels are included for the cups and string to convey basic communication, aligning with the student's proficiency level. The prompt also reflects the student's struggle to label scientific concepts like vibration and the simplistic note about communication. The misunderstanding of sound potentially traveling through air is hinted at but not explicitly depicted."
