  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people. I think they need to be talking to each other, so I’ll make one on the left and one on the right. I’m not very good at drawing people, so they might just look like stick figures. I remember there’s supposed to be something connecting them, I think it's a string, but I’m not sure how it works. I’ll try to draw a line between them. It might be a little wobbly and not exactly reach their hands. I can’t remember if there is anything else they need to have like cups. I'm not sure how sound travels through this, so I won’t draw that. I’m not going to label anything, because I don’t know what it's supposed to say. I hope this looks okay.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figures that are meant to represent students standing apart from each other on a white sheet. The student on the left should have a circular face and simple line body, same for the student on the right. Between the two figures, there should be a wavy, faint line that is supposed to represent a string, but it does not connect clearly to the figures. The style is simple and child-like, with colored pencil textures. No additional items like cups, labels, or sound waves are present.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's capability to draw only basic representations of students as stick figures and attempt to include a line as the string. There is no depiction of cups or sound waves, reflecting the student's lack of understanding about how a string telephone works and how it transmits sound. The absence of labels or explanations corresponds with the student's difficulty grasping the concept fully."
