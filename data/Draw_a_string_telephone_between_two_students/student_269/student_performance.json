  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students each holding one end of the string telephone, showing how they are connected over a distance.",
    "The student can illustrate how the sound travels through the string by using arrows or another visual indicator, though arrows might not be completely precise.",
    "The student can depict the required materials used to create the string telephone, such as cups and string.",
    "The student can label the cups and string to explain that sound travels through the string to communicate messages."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not clearly label the scientific concept of sound traveling through the string, potentially missing an explanation of vibration (student labels only partial parts or uses vague terms).",
    "The student may inconsistently include a note or drawing highlighting the importance of communication over long distances or may provide a simplistic note lacking depth.",
    "The student may incorrectly assume that the sound travels directly through the air between cups without needing the string (misunderstanding how the string facilitates sound transmission)."
