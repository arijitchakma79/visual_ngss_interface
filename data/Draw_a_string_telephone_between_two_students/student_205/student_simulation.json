  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a picture of a string telephone between two students. First, I'll draw two people. I'll start with the first student on one side of the page. I'll draw another student on the other side of the page. I think they should look like they're trying to talk to each other, but I'm not sure how to show the actual connection with the telephone. I’ve heard about using cups and string, but I'm not sure how to draw that. Maybe if I draw some lines between them, it might show that they are connected. But I don’t really know what I should be drawing to connect them. I'll just try some lines for now. Maybe I can add more details later if I figure it out.",
  "Prompt": "A crayon drawing on white paper showing two students standing separately on opposite sides of the page, drawn with simple shapes and bright colors. The students are facing each other. There are random, wavy lines in various colors between the students but no clear depiction of how they are connected, like strings might be. The background is plain with no extra objects or context provided.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects what the student can do by including two students without any clear connection, showing a fundamental understanding of having two participants. It also includes random lines that suggest the student attempted to connect them but struggled with capturing the string telephone concept, which aligns with misunderstandings about accurately depicting the string and cup connection or sound travel."
