  "Reasoning": "I remember we are supposed to draw a string telephone. I think it involves cups, so I'll start with those. I’ll draw two cups; maybe they’ll look like regular cups, but I’m not sure how they’re supposed to be for the telephone. Now, I need to draw the people using these cups. I'll try drawing two people, but I’m not certain where they should stand. I remember something about a string, but I’m not sure how to draw it. I’ll put lines that look a bit loose between the cups. I don’t really remember how sound travels through these, but I’ve seen arrows used in other drawings, so maybe I should draw some. I think they should point away from the cups since the sound comes out of them. Maybe I could add some extra details—I think buttons and batteries are important in tools, so I’ll add those too.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene showing two cups that might not accurately represent a string telephone. The cups are connected with a wavy or loose line drawing meant to represent the string. Two cartoon-like human figures, resembling students, are drawn with random placements, possibly not aligned to indicate communication. Include incorrect details like arrows pointing away from the cups and random additional elements such as a battery or buttons. Use a basic and slightly childish drawing style with bold outlines and simple colors like red for the cups, blue for the string, and green for the figures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two cups and figures but misplaces them relative to each other, as expected at their understanding level. The wavy line represents their struggle to correctly depict the taut string necessity. The incorrect arrows and added elements like batteries show their misunderstanding of sound transmission, as they cannot accurately depict the science behind the string telephone."
