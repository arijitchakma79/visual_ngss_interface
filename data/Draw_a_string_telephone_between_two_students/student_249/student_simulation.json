  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a string telephone with two people. I'll start by drawing two stick figures to represent the people. I know there should be a string connecting them, so I'll draw a straight line between their hands to show the string. Each person should be holding something like a paper cup because that's how string telephones work. I remember the cups need to face each other, but I'm not sure I'll get that right. I'll draw them holding the cups, but it might look like they're not aligned perfectly. The string needs to be between the cups, so I'll make sure the line connects both cups. I'll try to show them standing a little far apart to suggest they're trying to communicate from a distance, but I might not make them far enough to show this clearly. I wish I knew better how to show that sound goes through the string, but I guess just the straight line will have to do for now.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with two stick figure people on opposite sides of the picture, each holding a large paper cup that connects with a straight line. The line represents a string. Make sure the characters look like they're trying to talk to each other. They should be facing each other to suggest communication. Use muted colors like light blue, gray, and tan for a simple, child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's level because it includes basic elements like stick figures and a string connecting paper cups, capturing the core concept of a string telephone. It does not attempt to depict sound waves or capture the complexities of sound travel through the string, which aligns with the student's limitations. The student includes some design for distant communication but not effectively, as shown by the characters' positioning and simple connection."
