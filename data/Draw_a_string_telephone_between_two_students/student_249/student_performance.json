  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw two students without any connection between them, suggesting they might understand drawing people but not the connection needed for the communication.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly illustrate how the string connects the two cups, often omitting the string or incorrectly drawing it as a loose, detachable element (student doesn’t grasp its role in sound transmission).",
    "The student does not demonstrate how sound is used for communication through the string (student might not know sound needs a medium).",
    "The student cannot highlight the use of provided materials accurately, possibly showing random objects unrelated to a string telephone setup.",
    "The student doesn't show understanding of technology's importance in connecting people over distances, likely missing this concept entirely or showing unrelated ideas (student doesn’t connect the task to broader concepts)."
