  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown).",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two people with a simple connection between them, such as a line representing a string (basic concept of connection).",
    "The student can attempt to show a string linking two paper cups or similar objects, attempting to illustrate the basic setup of a string telephone.",
    "The student can show some attempt at a design indicating that the device might help in communication over a distance (e.g., two people standing far apart)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly show how sound travels through the string due to a lack of understanding of sound waves *(student might only draw a straight line without further detail)*.",
    "The student may not depict specific design features accurately, such as tension in the string or cups facing the right directions *(cups might face incorrectly without showing sound reception)*.",
    "The student is likely to misunderstand how the string telephone meets the needs of distant communication; they may not illustrate this benefit clearly *(distant communication not effectively represented)*."
