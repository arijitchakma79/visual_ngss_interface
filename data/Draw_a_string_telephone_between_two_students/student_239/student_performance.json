  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students who appear to be attempting to communicate over a distance.",
    "The student can include a basic design of a string telephone, showing cups and strings connecting them.",
    "The student can attempt to show sound traveling, possibly using lines or arrows in an inconsistent or unclear manner."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not accurately illustrate how sound travels along the string to communicate information (e.g., lines might not connect to the ear or may go in random directions).",
    "The student might not accurately label parts of the device or the purpose of each part (e.g., labels might be missing or incorrect such as labeling 'cup' as 'speaker').",
    "The student may neglect to draw a clear scenario of successful communication (e.g., both students have cups, but it's unclear if they are using them properly to communicate).",
    "The student may not show sound waves or may illustrate them incorrectly (e.g., showing waves moving away from both students instead of along the string).",
    "The student might not represent the utility of communicating over long distances or show an unclear understanding (e.g., no indication of distance importance or function beyond play)."
