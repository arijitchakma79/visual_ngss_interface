  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figure students. They’ll be standing apart from each other because they need to communicate over a distance. I'll draw one student holding a cup up to their mouth and the other with a cup near their ear. Next, I'll add a line between the cups to show the string that connects them and makes the string telephone work. I think sound moves somehow in waves, so I'll try drawing some lines or arrows from the mouth of the first student towards their cup. Maybe some arrows can also go from the string to the ear of the other student, but I'm not sure if they’ll meet at the ear or if they just go in that direction. I remember sound somehow travels through the string, so I’ll try to draw some zigzag lines on it, but it's hard to remember exactly how. In labeling, I'll put 'cup' on both ends but I'm not sure if 'string' needs a label. I don't really know if there should be more description about what each part does.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of two stick figure students standing apart with a simple background. One student holds a cup to their mouth and the other holds a cup to their ear. A straight line string connects the two cups. Rough, inconsistent arrows and zigzag lines attempt to indicate sound traveling, extending from the mouth and along the string towards the other student's ear but do not clearly connect all the way. The cups are labeled 'cup' but the string remains unlabeled. The drawing uses basic colors: the students in blue and red, the cups in yellow, and the string in black. The drawing style is child-like and simplistic.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt describes an image where the student has included the basic elements of a string telephone: two students, cups, and a connecting string. There is an attempt to show sound traveling with imperfect lines and arrows, reflecting their emerging understanding. The labels are rudimentary with the potential for mislabeling or missing labels in places, which aligns with the student's struggles to name or describe parts accurately. The child's simplistic drawing style and basic colors reflect the developing level of understanding."
