  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students facing each other. I'll start with simple stick figures to represent them and make sure they are clearly visible. I remember that it's important to show the string telephone, so I'll draw a cup in each of the students' hands. The cups will have a line connecting them, to show the string. I should make the string appear straight to show that it's tight, which means it works well for the communication. I'll add labels to the cups to show sound traveling through them and use arrows to point from one cup to the other, indicating the direction of sound travel. I want to remember to add notes about sound, like 'sound travels here', next to the string or arrows. I know I should include items that illustrate communication technology, so maybe a mobile phone near one student, although I'm not sure how to make it relevant here. I'll try to show some environment details around them like a park setting to hint at them communicating over a distance, but I'm not entirely sure how important that is.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two students facing each other, each holding a cup connected by a straight line representing a string. One student is on the left and the other on the right, with stick figures representing them. The cups are labeled with 'Sound travels here', and arrows point from one cup to the other to indicate the direction of sound travel. The drawing shows a park-like setting with a few trees in the background. A mobile phone is drawn near one student without any additional labels. The drawing is in a simple, colorful, child-like style, using colored pencils with emphasis on clarity of connection between cups.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: it shows two students using a string telephone, the string is depicted as tight, and there are labels and arrows indicating sound travel. However, it also includes a mobile phone without clear relevance, reflecting the student's struggle to illustrate technology's role. Although the student includes a park-like environment, they may not fully integrate how it suggests communication over a distance. The style and elements match a proficient level drawing, emphasizing clear and correct depiction of most elements, while highlighting minor gaps in understanding."
