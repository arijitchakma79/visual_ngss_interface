  "Reasoning": "I remember that for a string telephone, I need to connect two cups with a string. First, I’ll draw two stick figures to be the people. Each one of them needs to hold a cup, so I’ll draw one cup in each figure’s hand. I know that the cups are connected by a string, so I’ll draw a line for the string between the two cups. I'm not sure how sound travels through the string, so I’ll just draw the line without any extras. I need to label the parts, so I’ll write 'cup' near each cup and 'string' near the line. I think that's what a basic string telephone should look like. I wish I knew better how they actually talk to each other with this, so I'll just show them standing there with the cups. I hope I did it right!",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a string telephone. There are two stick figures, each holding a red cup in one hand. Between the cups, there is a straight black line representing the string. The figures are standing apart facing each other. The cups are labeled 'cups' and the string is labeled 'string'. The drawing is done with simple lines and basic colors like red for the cups and black for the string, on a plain white background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by focusing on the basic representation of a string telephone—two people with cups connected by a string. The stick figures and simple labels show an emerging understanding. However, the drawing does not include accurate details about sound transmission or real-world usage, which aligns with what the student struggles with."
