  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a complete device designed for communication over long distances, showing cups or similar materials used for the telephone ends and a string connecting them.",
    "The student can depict the use of sound by showing the string taut and straight to suggest the transmission of sound vibrations.",
    "The student can show both students actively using the string telephone, with one student speaking into a cup and the other listening, clearly indicating information being sent and received.",
    "The student can identify and accurately use only the materials provided for building the string telephone, such as plastic cups and string.",
    "The student can represent specific expected features such as the tautness of the string for effective sound transmission, demonstrating understanding of how the device works.",
    "The student can describe, possibly through labels or additional notes, how the string telephone enables communication by transferring sound vibrations from one cup to the other."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label all parts, possibly omitting a label for a string or one of the cups, though the representation is generally correct (labeled inconsistently).",
    "The student might include extra decorative elements that do not impact the device's function but could momentarily distract from the main focus (e.g., drawing flowers on the cups)."
