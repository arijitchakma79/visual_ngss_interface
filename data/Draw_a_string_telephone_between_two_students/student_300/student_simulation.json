  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a string telephone between two students. I'll start by drawing the two students. I'll make one of them a girl with long hair and the other a boy with short hair. I'll add in the cups â€“ I think plastic cups should work. I'll draw the girl on the left side holding the cup up to her mouth, like she's speaking into it. I'll put the boy on the right side, holding the cup to his ear to show he's listening. Now, the important part is the string. I need to draw it tight, straight between the two cups to show the sound vibrations can travel. I remember that it's important to show the transmission of sound, so I'll make sure the string is straight and taut. To make sure I'm drawing accurately, I won't add decorations to the cups. I'll add arrows to show the sound moving from the girl's cup to the boy's ear. Lastly, I'll label the cups and the string to make it clear what they are. But I might forget to label one of the cups, as I get focused on the main parts.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene of two students using a string telephone. On the left, depict a girl with long hair speaking into a yellow plastic cup. On the right, show a boy with short hair holding a blue plastic cup to his ear. Connect both cups with a tight, straight pink string to illustrate sound travel. Include arrows from the girl's cup towards the boy's ear to indicate sound transmission. The drawing should be colorful, in a child-like, playful style, and include labels for the cups and string. Ensure the string is depicted as taut. Omit any decorative elements like drawings on the cups.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities: it includes an accurate depiction with students using the string telephone, the string drawn taut to indicate sound vibration transmission, and labels indicating understanding of the device. However, it acknowledges a potential oversight in labeling all parts, aligning with the student's difficulty in consistent labeling. The prompt also focuses on accurately drawing the functional elements without unnecessary decorations, such as extra decorative elements on cups, staying true to the student's understanding of the task."
