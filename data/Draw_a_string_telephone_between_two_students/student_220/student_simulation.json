  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two people first. I remember people in drawings usually look like stick figures, so I will draw a stick figure on the left. Then, I’ll draw another stick figure on the right. I think there should be cups because I’ve heard that cups are used in a string telephone. I'll draw something that looks like a cup next to each stick figure, like an oval with a line down. Now, I need to add a string, but I’m not really sure where it goes. I’ll just draw a line near the stick figures, maybe above them, but I'm not sure if it connects. I heard that sound travels through the string, but I'm not sure how to show that, so I won’t add anything else about sound. I'll try to make it look colorful by using different colors for the stick figures and cups, but I might end up using colors that don't make sense for the scene.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil drawing of two stick figures, one on the left and one on the right, each next to a simple oval shape with a line down representing cups. A line, meant to represent a string, is drawn above but not connecting the cups. The drawing includes various colors for the figures and items, such as a red stick figure on the left, a blue stick figure on the right, and green and yellow for the cups. The style is simplistic and childlike, with colors that do not correspond to real-life objects.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing captures the student's minimal understanding by showing their attempt to draw two students with cups, which aligns with their ability to draw simplistic representations. The lack of a connected string and absence of any sound-related elements reflect the student's struggle with the concept of how sound travels through the string. The inclusion of unrelated colors and the lack of a clear setting further demonstrate the misunderstanding of the task and concept of distance communication."
