  "Reasoning": "Okay, let's start drawing. I need to show two students trying to talk to each other using a string telephone. First, I'll draw two stick-figure students standing a little distance apart from each other. Next, I draw each of them holding a cup to their ear or mouth. I remember, the cups need to be connected by a straight line to represent the string, so I'll draw a solid line connecting the two cups. Since this is supposed to show a string telephone, I want to include something that shows sound is traveling, so I think I'll draw some wavy lines or little vibration marks around the string. Oh, I need to add labels. I’ll write 'sound waves' next to the wavy lines to clarify what they mean. I'll also label the cups as 'cup phones' and draw arrows showing sound moving through. Maybe I’ll add a little scene, like they’re in a simple backyard setting, to show how the string telephone is useful. Lastly, I'll put a note explaining that the string telephone helps people talk over distances by using sound vibrations. I'm not always perfect with details like making sound waves look perfectly wavy, so the lines might just look like squiggles. I'll try to balance the space between the students, but if it's a bit uneven, I think it will still be okay.",
  "Prompt": "A line drawing featuring two stick-figure students standing apart with cups in their hands to their ears or mouths, linked by a straight solid line symbolizing a string. Include wavy lines or vibration marks along the string to indicate sound waves or vibrations. Each student is in the context of a simple backyard scene. Label the elements with 'sound waves', 'cup phones', and use arrows to show sound traveling. Include brief notes explaining the concept of sound vibrations helping communication over distance. The drawing should be in pencil and include some unevenness in the spacing between the students with squiggly sound waves for a realistic student perspective.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities and struggles by including all key elements described in the 'CAN' list: the students, the cups, the connecting string, labels, and context of use. It also entails some limitations as per the 'CANNOT' list, such as slightly uneven positioning and imperfectly curved sound waves, capturing the student's advanced understanding with minor imperfections."
