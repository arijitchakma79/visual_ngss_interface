  "Reasoning": "I have to draw a string telephone between two students. I remember seeing people using cups and strings as phones, so I think I'll start with that. I'll draw two kids because they want to talk with each other, and they need to be a bit far apart to show why they need the string phone. I’ll draw a cup in each kid’s hand and a string connecting them. The cups should look like drinking cups because that’s what I think they use in these devices. I'll try to make the string visible, but I’m not sure if it should be tight or loose, so I might leave it a bit slack. I'm thinking about adding some arrows or lines, maybe, to show that they're trying to talk, but I’m not really sure how to show the sound traveling. I want to label the cups but I think they already look like cups, kind of like from a party, so everyone will know. I don't know much about how communication is actually happening through the phone but I'll make sure the string is between the cups.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two children standing on grass at a distance. One child holds a blue plastic cup to their mouth, the other child holds a red plastic cup to their ear. A long string connects the two cups, appearing slightly slack. The children are smiling, showing they are trying to communicate. The style is child-like with bold colors and simple shapes, emphasizing the fun and playful aspect of their interaction.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to show a basic communication device with cups and a string, meeting the CAN requirements. The drawing suggests the intended purpose of the string telephone, but since the student struggles to show precise scientific functions, the string is slack, and there are no details on sound transmission or tautness. The cups are shown as typical plastic cups, in line with the student's ability, but may not be labeled clearly, matching the Level 2 description."
