  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students because they need to be trying to communicate over a distance. I'll make sure their bodies are facing each other so it looks like they are trying to talk. Next, I add a string tied tightly between them because it has to be a string telephone. I remember that it needs to be taut, so I’ll show the string pulled straight. I'll draw a cup at each end of the string for each student to hold to their ear or mouth, to show how the sound travels. I'll add some labels but I might forget to label all parts like one of the cups or the string. I should explain with some notes that the string telephone helps communication over distances, but I won’t write much detail like about how vibrations move through the string. I might remember that the string needs to be tight so sound can travel, but I won’t be clear about it.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two children standing facing each other, each holding a cup attached to a string telephone. The string is shown taut between them. The children are in a grassy field, one child has a blue shirt and the other a red shirt. The cups are labeled but there might be one label missing, like for the string. Basic notes are written nearby, mentioning communication over distance with a string telephone, but lacking details about sound vibrations. It's a simple, colorful drawing done in a child-like style with colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two students with a string telephone and conveys the basic idea of communication over distance. It also captures potential gaps such as missing labels and insufficient detail on how sound travels through a taut string, consistent with their proficient level description."
