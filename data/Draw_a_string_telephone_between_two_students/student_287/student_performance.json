  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a device showing two students trying to communicate over a distance using a string telephone.",
    "Illustrate how sound helps the string telephone work by traveling through the string, possibly using arrows to depict sound waves.",
    "Show the string telephone connecting to each student's ear and mouth, depicting how the communication happens.",
    "Label parts of the drawing to show that the device uses sound to transmit messages, like labeling 'sound waves' next to arrows.",
    "Depict or label the importance of using technology, in this case, the string telephone, to communicate over distances, such as writing 'communication' or 'distance communication'.",
    "Demonstrate an understanding that technology helps people communicate when they are far apart, which might be shown in a brief summary below the drawing.",
    "Include a brief note explaining how communication over long distances is helpful, such as a sentence like 'This helps us share messages when we are in different places.'"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might still occasionally omit minor labels, such as forgetting to label the cup as a 'receiver' or 'transmitter' in the string telephone setup (although they understand the concept).",
    "May sometimes not depict exact technical accuracy, such as showing a perfectly taut string, which could inaccurately suggest real-life application is always perfect (even if they understand the need for tightness)."
