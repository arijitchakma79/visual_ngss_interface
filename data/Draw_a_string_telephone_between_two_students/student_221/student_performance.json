  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw two people on opposite sides of the paper, possibly without any connection between them.",
    "The drawing could include two cups, possibly resembling telephones to the student, but without understanding how they work together."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show a string connecting the cups, or if shown, the string may not be taut and might just be a random line (student doesn't understand the need for tension in the string).",
    "The drawing will likely not demonstrate the concept of sound traveling through the string (student doesnâ€™t understand sound transmission).",
    "Sound transmission might be represented incorrectly, such as showing sound arrows between the mouths of the two people instead of through the string (wrong direction).",
    "The student might not illustrate or acknowledge the use of specific materials, like cups and string, even if they appear in the drawing.",
    "There may be no indication that the string telephone solves the problem of talking over distances, as the student might misunderstand the problem it addresses."
