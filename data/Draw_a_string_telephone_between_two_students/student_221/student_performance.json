  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate how sound travels along the string between the two people (student might not understand sound travel).",
    "The student may not include or correctly draw specific features, such as distinct cups or cans connected by a string (student may draw random objects or elements not related to a string telephone).",
    "The relationship between the device and communication over a distance might be unclear or missing entirely (student might not associate device with communication).",
    "The drawing might lack annotations or labels explaining how the string telephone works or why it would be helpful (student is unfamiliar with labeling for explanation).",
    "The student may not demonstrate how the device solves the problem of communication over distance, failing to show sound as a medium (possible misconception about the purpose of the string)."
