  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw two kids talking to each other. First, I’ll draw one kid on the left side of the paper, with a round head, some stick-style arms and legs, and a happy face. Then, I’ll draw another kid on the right side, looking somewhat the same. I know string telephones involve cups, so I’ll add a cup in each kid's hand. But I just draw the cups randomly close to their mouths because I think they talk into them like microphones. Now, I want to add a line to somehow connect the cups since I remember something about them being connected, but I just draw a wavy, loose line from one cup to the other because I'm not sure why it should be solid. I'll also add some lines to show sound coming from their mouths... maybe just some arrows pointing out from their mouths to show they're talking to each other. This way, it looks like they are communicating. I'm using crayons, so I'll make the kids' clothes colorful, one in a blue shirt and another in a red shirt, and the cups will be orange. The background will be a plain color, maybe light green, to keep focus on the kids.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two stick-figure kids on either side of the page. The kid on the left wears a blue shirt, and the one on the right wears a red shirt. Each holds an orange cup close to their mouth. A wavy, loose line in black connects the two cups. There are arrows near their mouths showing sound coming out. The background is a simple light green, with minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's Can Do by representing two kids and cups in their hands, which may resemble telephones. It also connects the cups with a line, albeit without understanding the importance of tension. The Cannot Do aspects are illustrated by the wavy line rather than a taut string, the misplaced sound arrows between the kids rather than through the string, and lack of clarity around the function of materials or the problem being solved."
