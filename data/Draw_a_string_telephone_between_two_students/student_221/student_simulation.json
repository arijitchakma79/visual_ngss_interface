  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two stick figures to represent the people using the telephone. I'll make sure they are facing each other. I remember that for a string telephone, you need something like cups or cans, so I'll draw a circle in one hand of each stick figure. I'll connect the circles by drawing a line between them, which is supposed to be the string. I'm not really sure how sound travels or if there's supposed to be anything else, so I'll just leave it like that. I'm not sure how to make it clear that they are actually communicating, so I won't add much to show that. I won't add labels or explanations because I'm not really sure about how all this works or why it's useful for talking over a distance.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two stick figures facing each other. Each stick figure is holding a rough circle shape in one hand. A single line connects the two circles, representing a string. The background is plain white. The figures are basic, drawn in pencil. The circles are colored very lightly, one is light gray and the other is light blue. The overall style is child-like and simplistic, with no additional annotations or detailed features.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do, such as drawing two people with a line between them and indicating basic objects like cups. It also reflects the student's limitations by omitting detailed elements, labels, and the concept of sound traveling, aligning with their minimal understanding of the string telephone's function."
