  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a simple device that uses a string and cups to communicate sound over a distance, with both cups clearly depicted.",
    "The student can show a string connecting the two cups, illustrating the connection necessary for communication.",
    "The student can label the cups and string, indicating an understanding of the key parts of the device.",
    "The student can include a basic representation of sound traveling from one cup to the other, such as wavy lines or arrows.",
    "The student can demonstrate the functionality of the device for communication by showing one student speaking and the other listening."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently explain how sound specifically travels through the string (e.g., lacks directionality of sound waves).",
    "The student may not illustrate how this device acts as an example of technology that makes life easier in a detailed or explicit manner.",
    "The student might omit minor labels for additional clarity (e.g., not labeling both ends of the string).",
    "The representation of sound travel might be oversimplified or lack detail (e.g., no indication of vibration)."
