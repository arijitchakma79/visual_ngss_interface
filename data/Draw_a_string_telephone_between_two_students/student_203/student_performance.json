  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a device made from string and two cups or cans to show a string telephone.",
    "The student can show the two students using the string telephone to communicate over a distance.",
    "The student can depict how sound travels from one cup through the string to the other cup, possibly using arrows to show direction.",
    "The student can add labels or symbols to demonstrate that the device uses sound to send information, though some labels may be incomplete.",
    "The student can include a partial visual or labeled description of how the solution solves the problem of communicating over a distance."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not show complete detail in how sound travels and could omit some explanatory labels or arrows *(student may think the concept is too obvious without labels)*.",
    "The student might inconsistently apply symbols or details that illustrate sound transmission, leading to partial misunderstandings of sound traveling through the string *(student may switch between showing sound as waves and arrows with inconsistency)*.",
    "The student may struggle with depicting distance accurately between students and string tension, sometimes showing a slack string which may not be functional *(student may not fully grasp the need for tension in the string for sound transmission)*."
