  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two figures that may represent students, though they may not clearly show that they are trying to communicate.",
    "The student can include some lines or shapes that could be interpreted as parts of a string telephone, like a string and cups, but might not connect them meaningfully."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot accurately depict a string telephone with all necessary parts correctly oriented (e.g., string might be slack, or not clearly attached to cups).",
    "The student does not demonstrate understanding that the string needs to be pulled tight for sound to travel (e.g., may draw loose or zigzagging string).",
    "The student cannot show how the device helps people communicate over a distance (e.g., lack of context or recognizable environment).",
    "The student is unlikely to label parts correctly, if at all, due to a lack of recognition of their function or importance.",
    "The student cannot demonstrate through the drawing how sound travels along the string (e.g., no indicators of sound, like vibrations or waves)."
