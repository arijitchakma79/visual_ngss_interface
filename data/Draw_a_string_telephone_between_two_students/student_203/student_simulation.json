  "Reasoning": "I remember that a string telephone is made using two cups and a string. So, I'll start by drawing two students. I'll draw the first student on the left side of the page and the second student on the right. I'll give them smiley faces to show that they're talking to each other. Next, I'll draw a cup in each student’s hand. It's usually a paper cup, so I'll draw them with a simple oval top and a cylindrical body. Now for the string connecting them, I'll draw a line between the cups—but I think I might accidentally make it too loose, because I don't really think about making it tight. I remember sound travels through the string, so I will draw arrows starting from the mouth of the first student, going through the first cup, along the string, and into the second cup. My teacher talked about labeling, so I'll add the word 'sound' close to one of my arrows. I can add arrows that show the direction sound travels. But I might not add all the labels, because maybe it’s already clear enough to see. Oh, and I'll try to show that they are communicating over a distance by drawing the students a bit apart, but not too far because I'm not sure how much space to leave.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of a string telephone between two students. The first student stands on the left, and the second student on the right, both smiling. Each holds a paper cup, connected by a slightly slack string. There are arrows drawn from the first student's mouth, through the first cup, along the string, and into the second cup. One arrow is labeled 'sound'. The drawing style is simple and child-like, with bright colors for the students' clothes and cups.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency by including all necessary elements like students, cups, string, and directional arrows. It also accounts for inaccuracies such as a slack string and incomplete labeling, which are consistent with the student's struggles and misconceptions. The style and colors match the effort level typical of a student at this level."
