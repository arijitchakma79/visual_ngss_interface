  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone. First, I'll draw two stick figures to be the students talking to each other. I'm not sure how to make them look like they're using a telephone, but I'll try my best. I'll draw a cup next to each figure. I think the cups need to be at their mouths, but I'm not sure how to show that. Next, I'll draw a line starting from one cup to the other. I don't really remember if the string needs to be straight or tight, so I'll make it wavy and zigzagging between the cups. I won't add any labels because I'm not sure what to write or where. I think this looks like a string telephone because there are two people with cups and a string between them.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figures facing each other, each holding a large, crudely drawn cup near their mouths. Between the cups, draw a zigzagging, loose line representing a string that doesn't quite look tight. The background is plain, with no additional context like a room or outdoor area. Use basic colors: figures in simple clothes, cups in gray, and the string in black. The style is simplistic and cartoonish, like a rough childâ€™s sketch.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's level by including stick figures with cups intended as part of a string telephone but lacking a clear demonstration of communication. The string is zigzagging, not tight, showing a misunderstanding of sound travel. There are no labels or contextual elements to explain the function, aligning with what the student cannot do."
