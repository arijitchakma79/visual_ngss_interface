  "Reasoning": "First, I'm going to draw two stick figure students standing facing each other. They should be smiling to show they are happy and using the string telephone. I'll draw each student holding the rim of a paper cup. Next, I'll connect the two cups with a straight, taut line representing the string. I know the string has to be taut for the sound to travel, so I'll make sure it looks straight and tight between the cups. Now, I'll add some lines or waves emanating from the mouth of one student to show they're speaking and the sound is traveling into the cup. I remember that sound travels through vibrations, so Iâ€™ll try to show some lines for the sound. I'll label the cups and the string to show what each part is, but I might forget to label one part clearly. Finally, I'll add some labels or notes near the string to indicate the concept of sound vibration, although I might not get all the details of how air vibrates just right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two happy stick figure students facing each other, each holding a white paper cup. Connect the cups with a straight red line representing a string, showing it's taut. Add sound waves depicted as curved lines emanating from the mouth of one student into their cup. Use labels on the cups and string, but one label may be slightly unclear. The background should be simple and colorful to reflect a fun, educational setting.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt accurately captures the student's abilities and limitations. It reflects the student's understanding of the science task by showing the string telephone with taut string and labels the components, while also incorporating sound travel using wave lines. However, it also acknowledges the potential for inconsistent labeling and incomplete details about sound vibrations."
