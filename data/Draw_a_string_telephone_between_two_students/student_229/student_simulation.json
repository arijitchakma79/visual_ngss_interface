  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm supposed to draw a string telephone between two students. I remember that a string telephone has cups, so I'll start by drawing two shapes that look like cups. I think cups are kind of like upside-down U shapes, so I'll draw that first. Now, I'll try to draw the students. I know people look like stick figures, so I'll draw two of them. One will hold the cup to their ear, but I'm not sure if the other one should be holding a cup or something. Let's just have them both holding the cups. Now, for the string... I know it should be between the cups, but I'm not sure how tight it's supposed to be. I'll just draw a wavy line between the two cups. Oh, I forgot to make the students look different; they both look the same, but that's okay. I don't really know how sound moves, so I won't add anything like that. Maybe a little close together, but I guess that's fine.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a string telephone. There are two simple stick figure students. Each student is holding an upside-down U-shaped object resembling a cup. The cups are not clearly labeled. A wavy, loose line connects the two cups. The drawing is colored with basic colors like red, blue, and yellow. The figures are not distinct from each other in terms of features. The students are standing close together, and there are no indicators of sound movement, like arrows. The scene is simplistic, resembling a drawing by a beginner student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately captures what the student can do, like creating shapes resembling cups and drawing stick figure students. It also reflects the student's misunderstandings: the string is depicted as loose, there are no indicators of sound movement, the figures are indistinct and close together, and the essential elements of a working string telephone are not clearly portrayed. This aligns with the student's minimal understanding as described in the 'Level Description'."
