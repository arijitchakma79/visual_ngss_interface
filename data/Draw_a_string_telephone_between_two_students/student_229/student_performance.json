  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw two figures that resemble students, but the figures could be simple or stick figures.",
    "The student may draw two shapes that look like cups, although they might not be clearly labeled or connected correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly depict the string connecting the cups in a taut line. The string might be drawn loosely or not connected to both cups (e.g., the string hanging limply or not drawn at all).",
    "The student may not show two distinct students using the device for communication (e.g., one student may not be holding their cup to their ear).",
    "The concept of sound traveling through the string may not be illustrated or represented (e.g., no indications such as arrows or lines suggesting movement of sound).",
    "The drawing might lack space between the students to depict the device working over a distance, with students depicted too close together or facing the wrong direction.",
    "The student may not recognize or demonstrate how the string telephone actually works, such as completely omitting the string in their drawing or having the cups not aligned."
