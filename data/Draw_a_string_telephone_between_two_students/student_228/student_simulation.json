  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two children facing each other, since they are using the string telephone to talk. I remember that each child should be holding a cup to their ear or mouth, so I'll make sure to draw a cup in each child’s hand. To connect the cups, I'll draw a straight line between them to show the string. I should add arrows along the string to show the direction of sound waves traveling from one cup to the other. I'll draw sound waves represented by wavy lines coming out of or going into the cups to show how sound travels in and out. I’ll label the elements where needed, like 'Sound Waves.' I might forget to label one of the cups, but that’s okay. Overall, I’ll use simple colors to make sure everything is clear, like using red or blue for the string and cups. I’ll make sure the drawing looks neat to show a good setup using these materials.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene of two children using a string telephone. The two children are facing each other, each holding a cup with string connecting them. Add arrows along the string to show sound waves traveling back and forth. Use simple colors like red or blue for the cups and string. The children are smiling, indicating communication. Add wavy lines coming in and out of the cups to represent sound waves. The drawing should be clear and demonstrate a basic understanding of a string telephone setup in a playful, educational style.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt includes detailed elements the student can execute well, like the two children holding cups and the visualization of communication through sound waves and arrows. The use of simple colors aids clarity and aligns with the student's competence in showing the science concept visually. The prompt allows for minor omissions, such as missing a label or unnecessary lines, reflecting the students' level where some minor details might not be perfectly executed without impacting overall understanding."
