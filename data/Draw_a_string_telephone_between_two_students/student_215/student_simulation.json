  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two people on opposite sides of the paper because they need to communicate over a distance. I'm thinking about using two kids since they're usually who use these kinds of string telephones. I'll give each of them a cup, which is what the sound will travel through. I'll draw a string connecting the two cups because I know the sound travels along the string. I remember it needs to be tight, so I'll make sure the string doesn't have any slack in it. It's important that the string is visible, so I'll darken it a bit more than the rest of the picture. I'm not sure how to label each part in detail, so I might not do that. I also need to show only the materials I know will work, so I won't add anything else. Talking about how this makes life easier is tricky; I'd probably say it just lets them communicate when they're far apart.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two children standing apart, each holding a cup at their ear and mouth respectively, connected by a taut string. The child on the left is a boy with short brown hair wearing a blue t-shirt and shorts. The child on the right is a girl with pigtails, wearing a red dress. The cups are colored red, and the string is a bold black line connecting the two cups. The background is plain white to keep focus on the string telephone. The style is similar to a colored pencil drawing, with vibrant colors for the children's clothes and a simple, clear depiction without intricate details like labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do: it shows two people separated by a distance using a string telephone made from cups, with the string clearly depicted as taut. The student focuses only on the materials meant to solve the communication problem, with a clear visual connection between the two children. The drawing style and colors reflect a student's effort but lack detailed labeling and written explanation, matching the student's challenges."
