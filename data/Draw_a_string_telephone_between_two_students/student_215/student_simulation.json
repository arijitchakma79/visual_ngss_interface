  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two figures that look like students. I think I'll just make stick figures because that's how I usually draw people. I need to show that they're trying to talk to each other with this string telephone idea. So, I'll draw a kind of line between them that might be the string. I'm not exactly sure how the string makes sound go from one person to the other, but I know it's supposed to be important. The line doesn't really connect to their hands or ears clearly, but that's okay. I guess I'm just trying to show two people somehow communicating. I don't really know how this string helps them talk over long distances or why it's important, but at least it shows a line between them.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image with two stick figure students standing apart. Each stick figure is generic with minimal detail, just circles for heads and lines for bodies, arms, and legs. A wavy line, representing a string, connects the two figures, but not clearly connecting to specific parts of their bodies like hands or ears. The background is blank, and the drawing is in simple black and white, showing a basic attempt at illustrating a string telephone concept physically linking two people.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because the student can draw two generic figures indicating students and a line representing a string. The drawing also reflects the student's misunderstandings since it doesn't effectively depict sound traveling, the purpose of the string, or communication's benefitsâ€”key concepts that the student cannot demonstrate."
