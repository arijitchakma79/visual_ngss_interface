  "Reasoning": "I'll draw two people. They are supposed to be using a string telephone, like we talked about in class. I'll draw one person on the left holding a cup and another person on the right also holding a cup. I think there should be a line between them, so I'll draw a string or maybe a wire. I'm not sure if the string needs to be tight; I'll just make it a loose line. I remember there should be two people with cups, so they have them, but I'm not clear on how the sound really goes through. I'll draw the string kind of drooping. I don't think I need to label everything, it looks obvious to me. I guess they stand close together so everyone can see both of them, so they'll be facing towards me, looking happy with their cups.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two cartoonish students, one on the left and one on the right, each holding a colorful cup. There is a loosely drawn line between them, representing a string, but with no clear tension. The students are close together and face towards the viewer, each smiling. The drawing lacks labels and has a simple, colorful, and sketchy style with crayons or colored pencils. The background is minimal to emphasize the students and cups.",
  "Explaination": "The student draws two people with cups, indicating an understanding of the basic components of a string telephone. However, they struggle with the physical principles, such as sound traveling through a tight string, and do not clearly depict tension by drawing the string loosely. Labels are missing, reflecting the student's tendency toward minimal detail. The students being too close together signals a misunderstanding of distance in communication. The drawing uses a child-like style to reflect the student's beginning level of understanding."
