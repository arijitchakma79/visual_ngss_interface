  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "May draw two figures intended to represent students (figures might be simplistic or stick figures).",
    "Can draw rudimentary shapes that could be intended as cups (shapes might lack detail and are unlabeled)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Does not accurately depict a connection between the cups with string (may forget to draw the string or draw it inaccurately, e.g., floating above or below the cups).",
    "Unable to illustrate how sound travels along the string (may draw arrows in incorrect directions or omit them entirely).",
    "Fails to label the key components needed for communication effectively (terms like 'cup' or 'string' are missing or mislabeled).",
    "Misstates the purpose of the device, such as drawing unrelated objects for communication like a telephone made from electronic devices (may think any representation of communication is suitable).",
    "Does not show or misunderstand the requirement of needing to communicate over a distance (might demonstrate figures communicating directly without the device)."
