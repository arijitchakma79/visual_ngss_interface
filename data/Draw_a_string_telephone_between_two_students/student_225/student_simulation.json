  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone with two students. I'll start by drawing two kids, one on each side of the paper. They both need to be holding something. I remember seeing a picture where people were holding cups to make a telephone, so I'll draw cups in their hands. I'll try to make it look like they're holding the cups close to their mouths. Now, I think there should be something connecting these cups, but I don't really know how that works. Maybe I should draw a line, but I'm unsure if it should be straight or wavy. I'll make it straight because that's easier. Sound travels somehow, but I'm not sure how it works through this telephone. I think my picture needs color, so I'll color the kids' clothes and cups. I can't remember how to show that they are talking to each other without drawing things like arrows or waves, so I'll just leave it like this.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing of two students with simple features, each holding a cup. The two students are standing apart, each cup in their hand. A straight line, meant to be a string, connects both cups but does not show any indication of sound waves or arrows. The drawing is basic, colorful with bright clothes and cups, but lacks details indicating sound transmission. The style resembles a beginner's drawing with simple shapes and bright, random colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw two people with cups, representing their attempt at depicting a string telephone, which aligns with what they can do. The depiction of the connecting string is inaccurate and doesnâ€™t illustrate sound travel, reflecting the student's misunderstandings. There is a lack of any complex details about how sound travels or how the device functions, following the student's limitations."
