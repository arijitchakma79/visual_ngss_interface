  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone between two students. Let me start by drawing two people. I will use stick figures because they're easy. So first, I'll draw the figure on the left side using a circle for the head, a line for the body, and stick arms and legs. Now, I'll draw another stick figure on the right side in the same way. Next, I need to draw the cups. I'll try to draw an object that kind of looks like a cup; maybe an oval or a rectangle will work. I'll draw one next to each figure, but I’m not sure how to add details, so I'll leave them simple and won't label them. Now for the string...I think it should connect the cups, but I'm not sure if it should be straight or curvy, so I'll make it wavy and kind of floating a little under the cups. Lastly, arrows to show how sound travels...um, I know they should be there, but I'm not sure where to place them, so I'll leave them out for now. I think I'm done!",
  "Prompt": "A simple, colorful drawing showing two stick figure people, one on the left and one on the right, each with a simplistic shape next to them intended to be a cup. The cups are oval or rectangle shapes, not labeled, and a wavering line meant to be a string vaguely connects the shapes but does not convincingly connect them. The string floats a bit below the cups. The drawing lacks arrows or labels and is on blank paper with colored lines in crayon or colored pencil, showcasing a beginner’s understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities and struggles as it includes stick figure students and rudimentary shapes for cups, which the student can do. It doesn't clearly connect the cups with the string and lacks accurate depiction of sound transmission with arrows, which the student cannot do. The absence of labels and related components further aligns with their identified challenges, encapsulating the overall minimal understanding of the task."
