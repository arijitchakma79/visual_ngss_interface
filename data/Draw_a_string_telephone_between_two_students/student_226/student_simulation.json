  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm supposed to draw a string telephone between two students. I remember that it needs cups and a string, so I’ll start with that. First, I’ll draw two people—I’ll make them stick figures; it’s easier. Now, I need them to hold cups. I’ll draw a cup in each person’s hand. Hmm, I remember a string connecting these cups... I’ll draw a line between the cups to show the string. Maybe I should add a little wave or some lines around it to show the sound traveling, like in cartoons. I know the string should be tight, but I might have drawn it a little loose. I really wish I knew how to show that more sound comes through like on a real phone, but I'll just leave it as is. I think it would be cool to draw one person speaking, but I’m not sure how to show the sound traveling to the other person clearly. I might just make the person’s mouth open to show that they’re talking.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two stick figure students facing each other, each holding a simple cup attached by a loosely drawn string. The first student, on the left, has black hair and the second student has blond hair. They are using the cups as a string telephone. The cups are light blue and the string is a basic black line connecting them. Small wavy lines are drawn around the string to indicate sound traveling. The style is child-like and sketchy, with a focus on simplicity. The background is plain white.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt features the elements the student can include, such as two people holding a cup connected by a string and attempting communication. The imagery features some lines to suggest sound traveling, but lacks clear representation of sound waves or taut tension in the string, reflecting the student's partial understanding and struggles. The prompt avoids incorporating modern technology, aligning with the student's comprehension level. This matches the description of Level 2: Developing."
