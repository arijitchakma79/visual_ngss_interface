  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two stick figure students standing apart from each other. I remember that they need to have something like a cup for this string telephone thing, so I'll draw circles near their mouths and ears, sort of like they're either holding them up or getting ready to speak or listen. Now, I need to show the string that connects the cups. I'll draw a straight line between the two circles. Hmm, I think sound does something with the string, so I'll try adding some lines coming out of the cup like sound waves. I'm not sure if that's right, but it looks okay. I think that's how a string telephone works.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two stick figure students standing apart from each other. Each student is holding a can or cup near their mouth or ear. A straight line represents a string connecting the two cups. There are basic lines or arrows drawn around one of the cups, indicating sound waves, but they might not be correct in direction or placement. The drawing is simple and colorful, using crayons with colors like blue, red, and green for the cups and string. The style is childlike, with basic shapes and lines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict two students with objects resembling cans, with a line showing the string connection - accomplishing the basics of the task. The inclusion of sound wave lines shows an attempt to illustrate sound movement, consistent with what the student can do. However, the reasoning mentions uncertainty about sound wave direction, addressing the student's confusion about sound propagation through the string. The childlike style and use of simple colors highlight the student's developing level."
