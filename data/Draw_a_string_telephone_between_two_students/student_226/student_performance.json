  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students standing at a distance with an object resembling a cup or can near their mouths or ears.",
    "The student can attempt to illustrate a string connecting the two cans or cups, showing basic understanding of a string telephone structure.",
    "The student can include some representation of sound movement, such as basic lines or arrows emanating from one can (although it may not be entirely correct)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly illustrate how sound travels through the string, possibly omitting appropriate directional cues or arrows (student misunderstands sound propagation).",
    "The student may depict incorrect or inconsistent materials that don't align perfectly with the concept of a string telephone, such as using incorrect objects instead of cans or cups (student lacks clarity on the materials required).",
    "The student does not clearly show how the string telephone actually helps in communication over distance, possibly omitting or misplacing key elements like the mouthpiece and earpiece in context (student likely confused about function)."
