  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two people, each holding a cup connected by a string, attempting to communicate.",
    "The student can include the basic materials: cups and string, in their drawing, though they may be simply depicted.",
    "The student can make an attempt to show that the string is the medium through which sound travels, perhaps by adding simple lines or waves."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly show how the string needs to be taut for effective communication. The string might be drawn slack or curved (student misunderstands the importance of tension).",
    "The student is unlikely to demonstrate convincingly how sound travels through the string, possibly omitting sound waves or symbols altogether (student does not represent sound transmission).",
    "The student might not link the idea to modern technology effectively, potentially leaving it out or drawing unrelated devices (student doesnâ€™t connect the concept to technology).",
    "The student might omit or incorrectly illustrate aspects of sound communication, such as vibrations or directionality (student has a partial understanding of sound principles)."
