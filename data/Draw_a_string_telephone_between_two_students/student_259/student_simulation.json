  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing two stick figure students. They need to be far apart to show they're trying to communicate over a distance. Next, I'll draw a cup in each student's hand, since I remember that these are part of a string telephone. Then, I'll connect these cups with a single straight line for the string to show that they can talk to each other with this setup. I know the string must be drawn, but I forgot that it should be tight. I'm supposed to show that the string helps transmit sound, but I don't think to add any wavy lines or marks on the string to indicate vibrations. By drawing them far apart, I want to show that the string telephone can solve the problem of long-distance communication.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figure students standing far apart on grass. Each student holds a colorful cup, one blue and one red, connected by a straight black line symbolizing the string. Both students are facing each other. The background should be a sunny day with a clear blue sky. The drawing style should be simple and childlike, focusing on primary colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: it shows two students with cups connected by a string, illustrating a string telephone. The students are far apart, implying the problem-solving aspect of communicating over a distance. It doesn't meet the requirement of showing a tight string, nor does it depict vibrations, reflecting what the student struggles with or misunderstands."
