  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw a string telephone between two students. I remember that a string telephone needs two cups and a string. First, I'll draw two students, one on each side of my paper. I'll use simple stick figures to make them. Now, I need to draw a cup in each of their hands. I'll draw a red cup in one student's hand and a blue cup in the other student's hand. To show that they are connected, I'll add a line for the string, making sure it’s straight and not sagging, because the string has to be tight for the sound to travel. I know I should show the idea of communicating over a distance, so I'll make sure there’s some space between them, maybe by drawing a little house or tree in the middle as background. I remember something about sound waves, but I'm not sure how to draw them, so I’ll leave that out. Maybe I could write the words 'hello' near the students to show they’re talking. I'll label the cups and the string, but I’m not sure if I need to label the sound here.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two stick figure students, one on the left side holding a red cup and one on the right side holding a blue cup. The cups are connected by a thin black line representing a taut string. The background includes a simple tree and small house to indicate space. The students are drawn in a child-like style with simple facial features. The scene is colorful with a blue sky. The word 'hello' is written near one of the students to show communication without any visual representation of sound waves.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by showing the string telephone setup with two students, each having different colored cups, and a taut string between them, indicating an understanding that the string must be tight for sound to travel. There is an attempt to show communication over a distance through a background setting and writing 'hello'. What the student struggles with, such as not illustrating sound travel or labeling sound waves, is captured by the omission of sound wave representations and scientific terms related to sound transmission."
