  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not accurately demonstrate how sound travels through the string telephone, possibly showing no sound waves or incorrect representations like arrows pointing in the wrong direction.",
    "The student is unlikely to include labels explaining the travel of sound through the device effectively, possibly leaving the drawing without labels or with unclear descriptions.",
    "The student may not correctly illustrate the connection between the string telephone and the concept of communicating over a distance, perhaps failing to emphasize the importance of distance by drawing the people too close or by not highlighting why the device is needed.",
    "The student might inconsistently label materials, missing one or more components like string or cups, hence lacking completeness in material identification."
