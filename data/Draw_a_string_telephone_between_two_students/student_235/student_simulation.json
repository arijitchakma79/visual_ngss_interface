  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students who are trying to talk to each other over a long distance. I'll space them apart but not too far since I tend to forget to show why they need the string telephone. Next, I'll draw a string telephone between them. I'll start by drawing a cup in each of their hands. I'll connect them with a string, making sure the string is tight and straight. I'll add lines or arrows along the string to show how the sound travels. I need to remember that the sound travels through the string, not through some other device like a light bulb. I sometimes confuse which elements are necessary for sound transmission. Finally, I won't spend much time showing why they need the string telephone over that distance, as I usually assume it's obvious why they're using it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful, cartoon-style image showing two students standing apart, each holding a cup to their ear. The cups are connected by a tight, straight string. Include lines or arrows along the string to indicate sound traveling. The students should look engaged and curious. The setting is simple, with no added devices or light sources to imply the transmission of sound. A clear blue sky in the background suggests they're outside, emphasizing the daytime setting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt covers elements the student can handle, like drawing the two students with a string telephone and using lines to indicate sound movement. However, it omits extraneous devices like light sources, which the student might misunderstand as part of sound transmission, aligning with what the student struggles with. The prompt also leaves out explicit distance context to reflect the student's assumption that the need for the device is obvious."
