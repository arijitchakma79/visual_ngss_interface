  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw two students with cups and a string connecting them, indicating an attempt at a string telephone setup.",
    "Label the string and possibly the cups, demonstrating a basic understanding of components needed for communication.",
    "Include some elements to suggest sound transmission, like wavy lines near one student's mouth, indicating sound waves (though details may be inconsistent)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently show that the string is taut, which is necessary for effective sound transmission (student may draw the string as slack).",
    "Explain how sound travels through the string with scientific labels or notes (student may misunderstand how sound works in this context).",
    "Illustrate or understand that only provided materials should be used, possibly incorporating incorrect or additional elements not typical in a string telephone (like an extra cup or an electronic component).",
    "Evaluate effectively whether the design meets communication needs (student may not consider how the setup could function over a distance).",
    "Show how the device helps people communicate over long distances beyond their illustration of a string telephone (student might not grasp the problem of distance communication fully)."
