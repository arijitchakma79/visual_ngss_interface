  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll draw two people first. I think they should look like students because the topic says they are students. One person has short hair, and the other has long hair, just to make them look different. I remember that a telephone with a string goes between the people, so I'll draw a line connecting them, like a jumper rope or something similar. The line is between their hands, but I'm not sure what else to add to it or where it should end because I'm not sure what it's for. I should add more to show they are communicating, maybe some arrows or lines from their mouths. I think I should draw a cup, but I'm not sure where it goes or what it does, so I'll just draw a cup floating somewhere between them. I don't remember what to label things, so I might just write 'telephone' next to something because that's the topic.",
  "Prompt": "A simple crayon drawing shows two stick figure students standing apart, with one having short hair and the other with long hair. There is a wavy line in bright colors, like red, connecting their hands. Randomly floating between them, there is a large crudely drawn cup with no clear connection to the line or the people. Above the line, there are scattered arrows pointing in different directions. Close to the line, the word 'telephone' is written in colorful crayon, somewhat randomly and unrelated to any part of the drawing. The scene is colorful but disorganized, with no clear depiction of how the objects relate to actual communication.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing captures what the student can do, like depicting two students and a line that suggests connection. The disorganized line and floating cup show the misunderstanding of the string's purpose and the cups in facilitating communication. The random use of 'telephone' as a label reflects the lack of correct labels or understanding of the device's function, consistent with the student's limitations in understanding the task."
