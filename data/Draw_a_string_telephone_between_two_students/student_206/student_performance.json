  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two people needing to communicate with some depiction of physical distance between them.",
    "The student can draw a basic string telephone setup using essential components like cups and string, though details may be simplistic.",
    "The student may include some indication that sound travels through the string (e.g., wavy lines traveling along the string)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not effectively show how the string telephone solves the problem of communicating over distance (e.g., lack of visual cues tying communication to the string telephone).",
    "The student might struggle to detail how sound vibrations move through the string, resulting in vague or unclear representations (e.g., absence of arrows or labels indicating sound travel).",
    "The student could have difficulty illustrating the materials used in a structurally clear manner, such as cups being misaligned with string (e.g., string not reaching both cups or cups not looking like communication objects)."
