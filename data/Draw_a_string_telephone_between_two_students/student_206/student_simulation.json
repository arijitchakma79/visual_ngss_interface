  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two stick figures to represent the students. I know that this is the simplest way to show people, but I'm not sure how to make them look like they are communicating. I’ll draw a straight line between them to show a string, but I don’t really understand how this helps them talk to each other. I don’t remember if the string should connect to anything specific, so I’ll just draw it in a straight line from one figure to the other. I think these are supposed to be cups or something for the string, but I’m not really sure how that works. I won’t label anything because I’m not sure what the materials are or how any of this actually transmits sound. I’m also not sure how to make it look like the string is for long-distance communication; it just looks like a line between two people.",
  "Prompt": "A simple colored pencil drawing featuring two stick figures meant to represent students. The figures are basic with minimal details, just circles for heads and lines for bodies and limbs. Between them, there is a straight black line, intended to be a string. The drawing lacks specific features like cups or other materials, and there are no labels. The overall appearance is naive and does not convey the function of sound transmission.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do as it includes the stick figures and a line representing a string, demonstrating the student's basic understanding. It also reflects the student's limitations as it omits elements that indicate the function of the device (sound transmission via string) or the materials used (cups, string tension). The prompt describes a simple, basic drawing without detailed context or labeling."
