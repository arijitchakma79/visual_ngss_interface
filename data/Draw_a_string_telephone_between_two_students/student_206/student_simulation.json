  "Reasoning": "I want to draw a string telephone to show how two people can talk to each other from a distance. First, I’ll draw two people standing apart from each other. I'll make sure there is some space between them so it looks like they need to talk across a distance. Next, I'll draw a cup next to each person. I know that I’m supposed to use cups for the phone part, but I might struggle a bit with making them look exactly like communication devices. Then I’ll connect the cups with a line to show the string. The string will reach both cups, but I might not get the alignment perfectly right. To show that sound travels through the string, I'll add some wavy lines or simple marks along the string, although I might not remember to use arrows or labels to clearly show that this represents sound traveling. Finally, I’ll color the drawing to make it more complete, but I'm not too worried about the accuracy of colors and details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple and colorful scene of two children standing apart from each other, each holding a cup by their ear. A single line connects both cups, representing the string. Add a few wavy lines along the string to suggest sound, but without arrows or labels. The children should look happy and facing each other, standing on a grassy field. The cups might be slightly misaligned and simplistic in design, but it's clear they are holding them to communicate.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's can and cannot do because it includes the critical components like children and cups to show a string telephone. However, it also reflects the student's struggles by having the potential for misaligned cups and the lack of detailed indication of sound travel, such as missing arrows or labels."
