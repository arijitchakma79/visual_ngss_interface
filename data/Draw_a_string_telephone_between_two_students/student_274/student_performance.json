  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using a string telephone to communicate over a distance, with string connecting them.",
    "The student can show the string telephone device, such as cups, cans, or another suitable object, connecting the two students.",
    "The student can illustrate that sound travels along the string by drawing sound waves or lines to indicate communication.",
    "The student can include materials in the drawing that demonstrate an attempt to solve the communication problem, like taut strings to indicate functionality.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label parts of the string telephone (e.g., only labels one side) or miss labeling altogether.",
    "The student might not fully illustrate technological concepts, such as showing how the sound travels along the string, instead just focusing on the device itself (e.g., adds sound lines but no direction).",
    "The student might not clearly show how the tools and materials are purposefully used to solve the communication problem, focusing more on the students and less on the functionality of the string."
