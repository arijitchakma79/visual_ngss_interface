  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a string telephone with two students. I remember that a string telephone uses two cups and a string, so I'll start by drawing two kids. One kid on the left and one on the right. I'll give each kid a cup. The cups need to be connected, so I'll draw a line for the string from one cup to the other. I should label the cups. I'll write 'cup' next to one of them, but I might forget to label the string or not label all parts. I need to show sound traveling through the string, but I'm not sure exactly how. I'll try drawing some wavy lines from one cup to the other, but they might be inconsistent or not look right. I know this is supposed to be a way to talk over a distance, but I'm having trouble showing how it works without technology. I think I'll just focus on getting the basics down, like the cups and the string.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a string telephone with two kids. Each kid is holding a cup. There is a line connecting the cups to represent the string. One cup is labeled 'cup', and the other parts may have missing or inconsistent labels. Attempted wavy lines are drawn between cups to suggest sound waves. The drawing features simple colors and a childlike style, with a basic and emerging understanding of the string telephone concept.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw the basic elements of a string telephone: two kids, cups, and a connecting string. It acknowledges the student's partial labeling and attempt to depict sound travel with wavy lines, which may be inconsistent or misunderstood. The style and details show the developing understanding as described, without clear demonstration of sound travel or the device's purpose, consistent with what the student 'cannot' do."
