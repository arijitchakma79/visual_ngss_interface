  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two people. I'll make them look like students, with one on each side of the paper, because they are using the string telephone to talk. I'll try to make one look like they are talking by showing their mouth open and the other like they are listening. Next, I'll draw a line between them to show the string. I need to make sure the string looks tight, because that's how the sound travels. I'll add a cup at each end, because cups make a good string telephone. Now I'll draw some curved lines around the talking student to show sound. Oh, I need to show sound traveling along the string, so I'll add some lines there too, but I'm not sure which direction they should go. Maybe if I add some arrows or something, they might look better... I forgot to label the parts of the telephone, but you can still see what it is. Iâ€™ll make one cup bigger to show it's different. I'll color the string red to make it stand out and the cups blue. The students will have different hair colors so they look different from each other.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of two students using a string telephone to communicate, positioned on opposite sides of the image. The students are drawn with simple, childlike features: one with their mouth open, indicating speaking, and the other with an attentive, listening expression. Between them is a taut red string. On each end of the string are blue cups, held up to the speaking student's mouth and the listening student's ear. Sound waves are represented by curved lines around the speaking student's mouth and along the string, intended to show communication. The drawing is not labeled, but the elements are clearly visible. The students have different hair colors, adding diversity to the scene, and the overall style is sketch-like with vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt aligns with the student's abilities and struggles. The student can accurately depict two students and make an effort to show communication through a string telephone, using colors to distinguish different parts. However, the student struggles with fully illustrating how sound travels using direction for sound waves, lacks consistent labeling, and focuses more on illustrating the interaction than the complete functionality of the device. The student's drawing shows a substantial attempt at correctly representing the concept while missing some finer details, which suits their proficiency level."
