  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a device that allows two students to communicate over a distance, with two students holding one cup each.",
    "The student can show the use of string as a tool to transmit sound between the two students, connecting the cups with a straight line.",
    "The student can represent the sound traveling from one cup through the string to the other cup by drawing arrows indicating the direction of sound travel.",
    "The student can label parts of the drawing to show how the string telephone works, including identifying the cups and string."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently illustrate how the design solves the problem of communicating over a distance using sound, perhaps not fully showing sound waves or the mechanism of vibration *(student may think the string itself transmits the sound without needing to vibrate)*.",
    "The student might not fully demonstrate how people communicate using sound when using the string telephone, such as omitting how speaking into the cup causes vibrations *(student may think placing ear to cup is enough to hear without understanding vibration)*."
