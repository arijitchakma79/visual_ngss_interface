  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students, one on each side of the paper. They should be facing each other. I remember that the string telephone needs two cups, so I'll draw each student holding a cup close to their mouth and ear. I'll make sure to connect the cups with a straight line to represent the string. I think the string needs to be tight for the telephone to work, but I'm not great at always showing it tight, so it might look a bit too loose in my drawing. I'll add some wavy lines between the cups to show sound waves moving along the string. For the materials, I'll use simple drawings of paper cups and draw the string in between. Finally, under the drawing, I'll include a small note that says 'The string helps the sound travel from one cup to the other.' I understand how the string works, but I might not explain too deeply about solving long-distance communication.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two cartoon-style students facing each other, each holding a paper cup connected by a string in a children's art style. The students are colorful with one wearing a red shirt and the other a blue shirt. The string connecting the cups is slightly slack. There are wavy lines in pencil coming from the mouth of one student to the ear of the other to represent sound. The cups are drawn as simple tan or white paper cups with a slight shine. The scene is vibrant with a light green grass and blue sky. Below the drawing, there is a handwritten note that says, 'The string helps the sound travel from one cup to the other.'",
  "Explaination": "This prompt matches the student's abilities as it shows the two students holding cups connected by a string, illustrating a basic understanding of a string telephone. The drawing includes sound waves to represent sound traveling. The depiction of materials is simple and reasonably accurate, focusing on recognizability rather than precision. The note adds a level of understanding about sound transmission, but lacks depth in explaining distance communication issues, highlighting what the student struggles with."
