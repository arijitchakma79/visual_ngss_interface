  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students. I need to make sure it looks like they're holding something, so I'll draw a cup in each of their hands. I remember that the string connects the cups, so I’ll draw a straight line between the two cups. Now, how do I show that sound travels? I'll draw arrows pointing from one cup to the other to show the direction of the sound. I also need to label these parts—labeling the cups as 'Cup A' and 'Cup B' and the string simply as 'String.' I know the string helps with sound transmission, but I'll just draw it as a line without showing vibrations because I’m not sure how that works. I think I also need to show them listening—I'll show one student talking near their cup and the other with their ear close to the other cup, even if I'm not sure exactly why this works. I need to make sure everything's clear with labels.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image showing two students. Each student holds a cup connected by a straight piece of string. One student is speaking into their cup, while the other has their ear near their cup. The string is drawn as a straight line, and there are arrows indicating sound traveling from one cup to the other. Parts of the drawing are labeled: the cups are labeled as 'Cup A' and 'Cup B', and the string is labeled 'String'. The style is simple and colorful, with labels written neatly.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student’s capabilities by displaying two students using a string telephone with labeled parts. It illustrates the flow of sound with arrows connecting the cups but doesn’t show detailed sound wave mechanics or string vibrations, aligning with the student’s misunderstandings."
