  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw two students communicating over a long distance using a string telephone, with clear depiction of the students and the string connecting them.",
    "The student can effectively illustrate how sound travels along the string, possibly using arrows or vibrations to indicate the transfer of sound.",
    "The student can clearly depict the problem-solving process of designing a string telephone, perhaps showing trial and error or adjustments being made.",
    "The student can accurately show the materials used to construct the device, such as cups and string, with appropriate detail to differentiate each component.",
    "The student can compellingly demonstrate how the string telephone functions to solve the communication problem using sound, potentially including labels for 'sound' or 'vibrations'.",
    "The student can illustrate how technological devices like a string telephone help people connect over distances, possibly including examples or scenarios of its use."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor labels or arrows, not affecting overall understanding (e.g., forgetting to label one end of the string as 'sound travels here').",
    "The student might not depict every step of the design process if the focus is more on the functioning device, though their representation of the device itself is accurate."
