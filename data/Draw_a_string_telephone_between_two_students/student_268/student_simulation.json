  "Reasoning": "I remember that I need to draw a string telephone with two students communicating. First, I'll draw two students, one on each side of the paper. I'll give each one a cupâ€”I know one cup should be at their mouth and the other at their ear to show that they're talking and listening. Now, I'll draw a string connecting the two cups. I've learned that the string has to be tight; if it's too loose, the sound won't travel. So I'll make sure to draw the string straight and not sagging. I think I should make the string stand out by using a bold color, maybe red, so it's clear. I'll also try to draw the string as if the sound is traveling, maybe with some little lines or waves near it, but I'm not sure if this shows exactly how the sound moves. Although I remember this activity shows how people can use this simple technology for communication over distances, I'm not certain about adding text, so I might skip that part.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two cartoon-style students standing apart, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth. Connect the cups with a straight, red string to indicate it's tight. The background is a simple outdoor setting with green grass and a blue sky. The cups should be made out of white paper or plastic. The students are wearing colorful clothes, one in a yellow shirt and the other in a blue one. Add small wavy lines around the string to suggest sound traveling, though no arrows or specific labels needed.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt incorporates all elements the student can execute proficiently: students holding cups, the string is tight, and it's clear the materials are cups and string. The students' inability to explicitly show sound travel or provide detailed labels is reflected in the lack of arrows and additional complexity, aligning with the student's identified limitations."
