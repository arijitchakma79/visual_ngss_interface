  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students, each holding a cup to symbolize the string telephone. I'll draw them a good distance apart to show that the string telephone can help them communicate over a distance. I remember that the string needs to be shown taut for the telephone to work. I’ll make sure to draw the string clearly connecting the two cups in the students’ hands. To show how sound travels, I’ll draw arrows along the string, maybe with some squiggly lines to represent vibrations. I want to include labels to make things clear, like labeling the arrows 'sound travels' or the lines 'vibrations.' I’ll depict the materials I’m using by drawing the cups and string in detail, making sure they look like a real string telephone. Maybe I’ll include a small scene showing them trying different lengths of string or different types of cups to show problem-solving, though I might not show every single step if I’m focusing mostly on the final working version. Finally, I'll put in a scenario, like one student clearly saying something, even if I forget to label one end with ‘sound travels here’ but that’s okay as long as the main idea is clear.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed colored pencil drawing of two students using a string telephone, standing apart in a park. Each student holds a paper cup in hand, connected by a visible, taut string. Arrows are drawn along the string to illustrate sound traveling, with squiggly lines denoting vibrations. The drawing includes labels such as 'sound travels' and 'vibrations' near the arrows and lines. The scene shows a small trial area, maybe with differing lengths of string or extra cups. The style is realistic but with a classroom project feel, with each component: cups, string, students, park setting, and labels drawn clearly.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's advanced level by accurately showing the communication process with a string telephone, depicting both students and how sound travels. The drawing includes detailed components and an element of problem-solving, adhering to what the student can do. It also accounts for potential minor omissions in labels while emphasizing correct representation of the device itself."
