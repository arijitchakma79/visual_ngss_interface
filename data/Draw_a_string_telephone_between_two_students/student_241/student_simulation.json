  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two figures because I know I need to show two students somehow. They need to stand apart on the page. I'll make them like stick figures since that's easy for me, and maybe I'll put smiles on their faces. I know a string telephone needs to connect them, but I'm not sure how to show that part clearly. Maybe I’ll just draw a line from one hand of one figure to the other hand of the second figure, but it might not look like a string. I don’t remember what else is needed, so I won't add anything else like a cup or a can, and I'm not sure how to add sound waves. I guess if I draw the figures really far apart, it might show they're trying to talk over a distance, but I don’t know how to show why that’s important either.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figure students on a white background, one on the left and one on the right side of the page. Both figures should be showing simple facial expressions and casual clothing in bright colors. Attempt to connect the two figures by a single straight line from one figure’s hand to the other’s hand. The line does not look like a string and has no details or context. Avoid adding additional elements like sound waves, cans, or other communication device parts. The drawing style should be simplistic and childlike, reflecting a beginning understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes their ability to draw two figures that represent students. It aligns with their challenges as it lacks a recognizable representation of a string or any other significant features of a string telephone, such as cans or symbols indicating sound waves, which the student cannot conceptualize at this level."
