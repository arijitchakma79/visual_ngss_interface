    "The student is unlikely to show accurately that the string telephone uses sound to send and receive information (e.g., no sound waves or unclear direction of sound).",
    "The student might not include symbols or notes in the drawing or may do so incorrectly (e.g., confusing visuals for sound travel, like arrows pointing in the wrong direction).",

    "The student might not fully use the materials provided for their drawing to show how the solution works, lacking details or neatness."
