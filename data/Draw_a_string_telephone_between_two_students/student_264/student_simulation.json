  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students standing apart from each other. I'll make sure to show them holding some cups, as I remember the string telephone is made from paper cups and string. I think I'll draw a straight line of string connecting the bottoms of the cups the students are holding. As for labeling, I know I'm supposed to label the cups and string, but I might miss a label or get one wrong. I'll also draw a couple of arrows along the string to show the sound traveling, but I might forget to include arrows in both directions or place them correctly. To show that sound helps them communicate, Iâ€™ll add wavy lines like sound waves coming out of one cup, though I might forget to draw it on both sides. I'll use simple materials, just like in class when we made string telephones, so I'll only need two colors for this: one for the string and one for the paper cups.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration of two children standing apart, each holding a paper cup connected by a piece of string. The paper cups are red, and the string is blue. The children appear to be talking into the cups. There are arrows along the blue string to indicate the direction of sound, but only on one side. Wavy lines symbolizing sound emanate from the cup on one side, suggesting communication. The drawing style is simple and colorful, resembling a child's effort.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by depicting the fundamental elements of a string telephone: paper cups, a connecting string, and an indication of sound travel with arrows. It also shows the correct materials (cups and string), aligned with what the student can successfully demonstrate. The student's potential misunderstandings are included, such as possibly missing labels or incorrect sound travel depiction, with arrows only on one side."
