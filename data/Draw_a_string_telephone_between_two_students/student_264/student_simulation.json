  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students standing a little distance apart, each holding one end of a string telephone. I’ll make sure they’re looking at each other as if they’re talking. For the string telephone, I’ll use paper cups at both ends, connected by a string. I remember that sound travels through vibrations, so I’ll draw some small lines or waves around their mouths and ears to show sound waves. I’d like to show the direction the sound travels, so I’ll add arrows pointing from one cup to the other, but I’m not sure if it’ll be perfect. I’ll label the cups and string with ‘cup’ and ‘string’, but I might forget to label something small. I also want to write a note about how sound travels through vibrations, using words like ‘vibrations’ and ‘sound waves’. I’ll try to include all the materials I’ve learned about, like only using paper cups and string, just to show resourcefulness.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, hand-drawn image of two students standing apart, each holding one end of a string telephone made of paper cups and string. The students look engaged, as if communicating. Sound waves are depicted with wavy lines near their mouths and ears. Arrows are drawn to indicate the direction of sound travel between the cups. Labels like ‘cup’ and ‘string’ are visible on the respective parts of the telephone. Annotations are included, describing the function of the device with words like ‘vibrations’ and ‘sound waves’. The overall drawing is detailed for a student level, with a focus on the basic components rather than intricate sound wave details, using bright colors and a neat, illustrative style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures everything the student can do: drawing two students, a string telephone with cups and string, depicting sound waves, and annotating with appropriate terms. It also reflects what the student might struggle with, like forgetting some labels or simplifying sound wave depictions. The style is consistent with the student’s capability to create an advanced, yet not overly complex, drawing."
