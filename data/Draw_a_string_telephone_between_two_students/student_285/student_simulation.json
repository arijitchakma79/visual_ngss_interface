  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people. I remember people have heads, so I’ll draw two circles for their heads. I'll add lines for their bodies and legs. Now, I’ll draw a string. It should go from one person to the other, so I’ll draw a line between them. I think the string should come from the heads because that's where people talk, right? I remember something about cups, but I'm not sure where they go, so I won't draw those. It’s meant to be a string telephone, so I’ll make sure the line looks long. I don’t know how sound moves, so I’ll skip drawing anything like arrows. Maybe I should add colors—I’ll color the people so they look fun. I’m not sure what colors to use, so I’ll just use different ones for the heads and bodies to make it look nice.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing of two stick figures. Each stick figure has a circle for a head and lines for the body and legs. A single straight line, representing a string, connects the two heads. The drawing lacks detail and complexity, with no cups shown. Figures are in bright and mixed colors, with different colors for heads and bodies. The style is simple and naive, showcasing minimal understanding of how a string telephone works.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including basic stick figures and a string line between them. It avoids depicting cups or showing how the string connects to the figures accurately, aligning with the student's struggle. By not including elements like arrows for sound or functional details, the prompt reflects the student's lack of understanding and captures their simplistic approach."
