  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students standing a distance apart. They need to look like they're trying to communicate, so I'll give them facial expressions that show they're talking and listening. I'll use a long string stretched between them, ensuring there's one cup at each end for them to hold and speak or listen into. It's important the string is taut, as this helps with how the sound travels. I'll add sound waves around the cups to show sound traveling through the string—like wavy lines moving along the string. Then, I'll label each part clearly: the 'cup' at both ends and the 'string' in between, even though I might forget to label the string as being taut. I'll write a small note next to the drawing explaining this string telephone lets the students talk over long distances. Lastly, I'll use bright colors for the cups and expressions on the students' faces to make it lively, and the background will show a clear, simple setting like a playground, to emphasize they are communicating in an outdoor space.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two students communicating using a string telephone. The students are standing apart with happy and engaged facial expressions. Each student holds a cup to either speak or listen, connected by a taut string. Include visible sound waves as wavy lines traveling through the string. The materials are labeled, such as 'cup' and 'string'. The setting is a simple outdoor area with a clear sky, possibly a grassy playground. Use bright colors for the cups and students' expressions to make the image engaging, while the style is semi-realistic and cartoonish.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as it captures the main elements of the string telephone—students, cups, string, and communication—with visual cues for sound waves. It includes labels per their capability, but acknowledges minor omissions like not specifying the string's tautness. The expressive details and use of bright colors align with the student's level of effectively illustrating the concept of distance communication for advanced representation."
