  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students positioned a distance apart with a clear intention to communicate.",
    "The student can illustrate the basic components of the string telephone, including cups and a taut string connecting them.",
    "The student can show arrows or lines demonstrating sound traveling through the string from one cup to another (sound path clearly indicated).",
    "The student can incorporate elements suggesting that this method helps solve the problem of long-distance communication, such as happy expressions or dialogue bubbles."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly demonstrate how the vibrations travel through the string (may not depict vibration detail).",
    "The student might inconsistently show the string as taut, which is necessary for proper sound transmission (string may appear loose in parts of the drawing).",
    "The depiction of the problem needing communication over long distances might lack context or detail (scant representation of environment or scenarios requiring communication)."
