  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using a string telephone to communicate, depicting an attempt at showing communication through the device.",
    "The student can illustrate sound traveling along the string, though this may be shown with unclear or incorrect arrows.",
    "The student can depict that the string is necessary for sound travel, but the depiction may not clearly show sound propagation."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately show how sound specifically travels along the string (e.g., lack of clear arrows or explanation).",
    "The student may not effectively demonstrate that the device enables communication over a longer distance than speaking without it (e.g., both students drawn too close together).",
    "The student might not clearly depict that the device uses sound to convey messages (e.g., missing elements like vibrations on the string).",
    "The student may not correctly identify all the materials used to construct the string telephone (e.g., cups or string may not be recognizable or labeled).",
    "The drawing might not highlight effective use of the device for communication (e.g., one student not holding the cup to their ear or mouth)."
