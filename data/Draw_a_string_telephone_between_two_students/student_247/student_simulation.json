  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students; I know they need to be standing apart because they're talking over a distance. I'll make sure they are facing each other. For the string telephone, I'll draw two cups - one in each of their hands. Now I need to connect these cups with a string. It's important that the string is visible connecting the cups, but I'm not sure if it'll look completely taut. I'll add arrows or lines to show that the sound is traveling from one student’s cup to the other. I want to show they are happy while using the string telephone, so I'll draw smiles on their faces and maybe dialogue bubbles to show they're communicating. I think I’ll leave out extra details like the exact path of the sound vibrations; that seems a bit complicated. The background might be simple with just a suggestion that they're outside, maybe some grass or a tree, but I won't focus much on it.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of two students facing each other, each holding a paper cup connected by a string. The string should appear mostly taut, connecting the two cups. Arrows on the string suggest the direction of sound travel. The students are smiling, with dialogue bubbles coming from one student to demonstrate communication. Include minimal background, like a suggestion of grass or a tree. Use colored pencils for a bright, cheerful look fitting a school science project.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to correctly position the students with cups and a string, as well as the intention to communicate by adding arrows for sound travel and dialogue bubbles. It highlights the student's level by mentioning efforts to create a happy scene while also acknowledging potential struggles such as depicting the string tautly or detailing vibration travel. The scenery is kept simple, consistent with the student's level of detail in representing environmental context."
