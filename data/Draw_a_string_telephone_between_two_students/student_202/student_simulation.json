  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two stick figures because I remember they are supposed to be people. One figure will be on the left and the other on the right. I’ll draw circles for their heads and simple lines for their bodies, arms, and legs. Now, I think I need to connect them somehow, so I’ll draw a line that goes from one figure to the other. Maybe this line is the string? I’m not sure where exactly to attach it, so I just draw it in the air between them. I think that it should look like the string connects them, but I'm not sure how string telephones work, so I won't draw any cups or anything else. I’ll add some grass in green to make it look like they’re outside, and hope that the line is enough to show communication, although I'm not sure how to show sound or anything like that. I guess that's it.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing with two stick figure people, one on the left and one on the right with circles for heads and lines for bodies. A lone straight line goes between them, supposed to represent a string, but doesn't connect to anything else. The figures are standing on some patches of green grass, against a white background. The style is child-like using basic colors and shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing includes basic representations of people using stick figures, which the student can do, but lacks detail on a functional string telephone, such as cups or connections, due to the student's minimal understanding. The line is present but doesn't effectively show sound transmission or how the telephone works. The lack of features like sound waves or sufficient string length illustrates the student's struggle to demonstrate communication over a distance."
