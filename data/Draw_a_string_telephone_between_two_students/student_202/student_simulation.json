  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone between two students. First, I'll draw two people on opposite sides of the paper. I remember they have to communicate over a distance. I’ll start with simple stick figures: one on the left and one on the right. Now, I need to add the string telephone. Let’s see, I know it involves two cups and a string. I’ll draw a cup next to each person; these will be their phones. They kind of look like rectangles or oval shapes. Next, I’ll draw a line to connect these cups across the length of the paper – that’s the string! I hope that shows they’re linked together. I know the string is important, but I can't remember exactly how the sound travels through it. I'll just draw it like two people talking over a distance without showing the sound path. I’m unsure what to label, so I’ll skip that part. I'm not really sure how to show it works over long distances, so the people are pretty close together.",
  "Prompt": "Drawing of a basic string telephone. Two stick figure students, one on the left and one on the right of the page, each holding an oval-shaped object that resembles a cup. A simple thin line connects these objects to represent the string in the telephone. The background is plain, focusing solely on the two students and their string telephone, with no additional details or labels. The drawing is in a childlike, rough sketch style using colored pencils, featuring basic colors such as blue for clothes, yellow for the cups, and a thin black line for the string.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures the student's ability to depict the fundamental components of a string telephone (the two people, cups, and string) without detailed labeling or an accurate conceptual understanding of how sound travels. The sketch reflects a 'developing' level, showing some effort and basic elements, while also highlighting the student's struggle to effectively communicate how the device functions for long distances."
