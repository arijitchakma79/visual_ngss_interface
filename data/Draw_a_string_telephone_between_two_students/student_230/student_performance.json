  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two cups connected by a string, indicating a basic representation of a string telephone.",
    "The student may attempt to show the direction of sound travel through simple arrows or lines, but these may not be consistently applied or clear.",
    "The student can depict basic elements like two students holding the cups, giving a rudimentary sense of communication."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to clearly show how sound travels through the string, possibly omitting arrows or incorrectly indicating sound waves (e.g., no or incorrect directional arrows).",
    "The student may not accurately depict the materials used, perhaps including additional or unnecessary items beyond the string and cups (e.g., drawing a bell or speaker that is not part of the task).",
    "The student may misunderstand the connection between the device and its function as a communication tool, such as showing sound traveling through the air instead of the string."
