  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate two people trying to communicate, possibly standing at a distance from each other.",
    "The student can design and draw a basic device using a line to connect two figures, representing the string.",
    "The student might label some parts of the device, such as 'string' or 'student' (some key elements labeled)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to incorporate clear elements showing sound used to communicate, such as waves or vibrations *(student may not understand the role of sound waves)*.",
    "The student might not properly label critical parts like 'cups' or fail to indicate how the parts function *(incomplete labeling of necessary components)*.",
    "The student is likely unable to illustrate sound waves traveling along the string correctly *(student may miss the concept of sound traveling through string)*.",
    "The student is unlikely to provide a clear or accurate explanation of how their design allows communication over distance *(lacks understanding of the sound travel mechanism)*."
