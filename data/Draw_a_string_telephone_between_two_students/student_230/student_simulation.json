  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a string telephone, so I’ll draw two people first. I'll make them small figures, maybe stick figures to keep it simple. One will be on the left side of the page, and one on the right side, so it looks like they can talk to each other over the distance. Now, I need to connect them with the string. I’ll draw a straight line from one person to the other, which is the string they’re using to communicate. I should label it, so I’ll write 'string' above it. I know I should add something for them to 'talk through' so I'll try adding a cup shape near where each figure’s mouth is. I'm not sure how the sound moves through it, so I won’t try to draw any sound waves. I'll label each person with 'student' because that’s what the task said. It feels a bit plain, but I'm not sure what else is needed.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful scene showing two stick figure students standing apart. Each student holds a cup near their mouth, and a straight line labeled 'string' connects the two figures, representing a string telephone. The background is plain with minimal detail. The labels 'student' are above each figure, and 'string' is above the line. The drawing style is basic, like a child's drawing, with crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt focuses on the student's ability to draw two figures connected by a line to represent the string of a string telephone and includes minimal labeling, like 'string' and 'student'. It reflects the student's struggle to include sound waves or an explanation of the mechanics of sound travel, consistent with their emerging understanding at this level."
