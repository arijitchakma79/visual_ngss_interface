  "Reasoning": "I remember that a string telephone needs two cups and a string between them. I’ll start by drawing two students. One will be on the left side holding a cup, and the other will be on the right with their own cup. I’ll make sure they appear to be holding the cups near their mouths and ears, so it seems like they are talking and listening. Now, I’ll connect the cups with a string. I need to show sound traveling, so I’ll try drawing some arrows from one cup moving along the string to the other cup, but I’m not sure exactly how sound travels, so my arrows might look a little random. I think I’ll use simple lines because sound moving in the air is confusing. I don’t want to add anything else like a bell or speaker because that doesn’t seem right. I hope this looks like they’re using the string to talk to each other!",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing depicting a string telephone between two kids. The image shows two children, one on the left side and one on the right, each holding a cup connected by a string. The children are smiling and facing each other. Simple lines or arrows are drawn along the string, attempting to show sound traveling. The background is plain to emphasize the cups and string. The style is a simple pencil or crayon drawing typical for elementary school students, using bright primary colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by illustrating two students holding cups connected by a string, suggesting a basic understanding of a string telephone. It includes arrows to indicate sound travel but acknowledges that these may not be clear or correct, aligning with the student's struggle in showing sound travel effectively. By omitting unnecessary items, like bells or speakers, the drawing stays true to the task, avoiding misunderstandings mentioned in their struggles. The use of a simple drawing style matches a developing student's capabilities."
