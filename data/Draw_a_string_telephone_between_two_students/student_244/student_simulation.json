  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing two students, one on each side of my paper. I'll make sure they are positioned at a fair distance from each other to show that they're communicating over a distance. I remember that a string telephone uses cups and a piece of string, so I'll draw a cup in each of the students' hands. I'll connect the cups with a straight line to represent the string. I'll add arrows along the string to show that sound travels through it. Now, I need to label the sound waves and maybe the cups to clarify their purpose. I might forget a few labels but I'll try my best to make it clear. I realize that my proportions might be a bit off, maybe the cups are a bit large compared to the students, but I think the overall idea is clear. I'll also write a simple description next to the drawing, like 'Sound travels through the string' to explain the concept of communication using this device.",
  "Prompt": "A colored pencil drawing of a string telephone between two students. On the left is a student holding a red cup, and on the right, another student with a blue cup. A taut, black string connects the two cups. Small black arrows are drawn along the string to indicate the direction of sound travel. Each student is smiling, depicted in simple cartoon style. The cups are slightly larger than proportionate to the students. Labels such as 'sound waves' near the arrows and 'cup' next to the cups are present. The drawing is colorful and includes annotations like 'Sound travels through the string' in a child's handwriting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately draw the device with some minor misses in labeling or slight proportional inaccuracies. The cups and string are prominently featured, indicating the correct use of materials. The arrows and labels demonstrate understanding of sound travel, while the slight disproportion and missing labels align with the noted struggles of the student."
