  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a device that connects two students using a string, with clear representation of cups at each end.",
    "The student can precisely illustrate how sound travels through the string, possibly using arrows or labels to indicate direction and movement of sound waves.",
    "The student can correctly depict the distance between the two students in their drawing, ensuring proportional representation.",
    "The student can effectively show how the string carries the sound from one student's cup to the other's, demonstrating a correct understanding of the concept.",
    "The student can clearly demonstrate how this device helps people communicate over a distance, possibly adding simple descriptions or labels to clarify this purpose.",
    "The student can accurately use the specified materials (cups and string) in the drawing, showing no elements not related to the task."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally miss minor labels or arrows indicating sound direction, though overall understanding is evident.",
    "There may be slight inconsistencies in scaling or proportions between objects (e.g., cups might be drawn slightly larger than realistically proportional), but these do not significantly detract from the comprehension displayed."
