  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students at a distance from each other on the paper. One student will be on the left, and the other will be on the right. I remember that for the string telephone to work, the string must be stretched tight between them. So, I'll make sure to connect them with a straight line representing the string. Both students need to be holding cups at the end of the string. I’ll draw a cup in each student’s hand, making sure they look like they’re speaking and listening. I’ll add little curved lines and arrows along the string to show sound traveling from one end to the other. To illustrate the concept better, I will add a label saying 'Sound travels through the string' beside the string. I’ll also try to compare this setup to modern phones by drawing a small symbol or image of a smartphone nearby. However, I might not clearly show how this is different from other communication technologies—I'll just add a simple label like 'Old vs. New'. Finally, I’ll use bright colors to make it appealing, with blue for the students' clothes, brown for the cups and string, and arrows in red.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two students using a string telephone. The scene shows one student on the left holding a paper cup, with a string stretched tight to a paper cup held by another student on the right. The string is brown, and the cups are made from paper. Arrows or curved lines in red indicate the flow of sound traveling through the string. There is a small label near the string that reads 'Sound travels through the string'. In the background, there's a comparison to modern communication, with a simple sketch of a smartphone beside the string phone setup, labeled 'Old vs. New'. Both students wear blue clothes. The drawing is colorful and filled with detailed elements, yet lacks precision in distinguishing technology differences.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's ability to illustrate the use of a string telephone with complete elements, like cups and tight string, and labeling sound travel. Using arrows to show sound transfer aligns with understanding communication over distance. Colorful appearance reflects their effort for clear depiction. However, struggles with differentiating communication technologies mean the comparison might be overly simplistic."
