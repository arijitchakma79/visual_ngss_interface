  "Reasoning": "I'm starting my drawing by sketching two people facing each other at a distance. These will be the students communicating using the string telephone. I'll draw each of them holding a cup up to their ears. I remember a string connects the cups, so I'll make sure itâ€™s clearly shown stretching taut between them. Next, I'll add arrows around the string to show that sound travels along the string. I need to ensure these arrows accurately depict the sound waves moving from one cup to the other. I'll also illustrate the cups clearly, focusing on their rounded shape and open tops to show that they are homemade telephones. Though I'll try my best, I sometimes forget to label parts, so that's something to watch out for. I want to show the purpose of this string telephone by drawing the students a bit apart, indicating they are communicating over a distance. I'll add color to everything, making the cups a noticeable red, the string a solid black, and sound wave arrows blue. I must remember to make the illustration clear enough to reflect how these simple materials enable communication.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two students standing apart, each holding a red cup to their ear with a black string connecting the cups, forming a straight line. Blue arrows along the string represent sound waves. The students are depicted cheerfully to indicate communication. The drawing includes color with a realistic style, focusing on the string telephone's elements: the red cups and taut black string, against a simple background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to accurately depict the string telephone and sound waves with a clear indication of purpose and construction. The simplicity of a clean background and focus on cups and string helps to emphasize communication over distance. Although detailed, the student occasionally struggles with minor labeling, which is accounted for in the absence of labels in the description."
