  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students on either side of the page, because they need to be at both ends of the string telephone. I'll make sure they're facing each other, so it looks realistic. Next, I'll draw a cup in each student's hand; they need to be visible and about the right size compared to the students, but I sometimes make them a bit too big or small. I'll use a straight line between the cups for the string because I know it must be taut for the sound to travel. I remember the string can't sag in the middle, so I'll ensure it's straight and not drooping. I want to show how sound travels through the string, so I'll add some arrows from one cup to the other. I think I can use labels to show these are sound waves. Even though I know that external factors like noise could affect it, I'm not really sure how to show that in my drawing. I'll focus on getting the main parts right first.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, hand-drawn sketch depicting two students using a string telephone. Place one student on the left and the other on the right, each holding a cup. Draw a straight string between the cups, highlighting that it is taut. Use arrows along the string to represent sound waves traveling between the cups, labeled as 'sound waves'. The background remains simple, focusing on the string telephone setup. Use bright, primary colors, and ensure the students and cups are slightly exaggerated in size, but accurately depict the connection. The style is reminiscent of a child's drawing, with clear, simple lines and vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's capability to accurately depict a string telephone setup with cups and a taut string, including sound wave representation via arrows, aligning with the 'CAN' elements. It also addresses the 'CANNOT' elements by allowing some exaggeration in size and omitting complex factors like external noise, focusing on the core setup instead."
