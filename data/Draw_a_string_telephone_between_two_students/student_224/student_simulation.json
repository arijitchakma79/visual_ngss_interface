  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students. I don't need to worry too much about how far apart they are; they can just be next to each other. I'll draw one student here and the other over there. Now, I need to add the cups for the string phone. I remember they need cups, so I'll draw a cup for each student. They might just look like simple circles or ovals in their hands. Making sure the string is there is important. I’ll draw a line from one student’s cup, but I can't quite figure out how it should connect to the other cup, so they might just float near each other. I won't worry too much about sound waves or explanations; that feels too confusing. Just getting the string in there is enough for now.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple illustration of two students standing side by side, both holding a cup in one hand. The cups look like basic circles or ovals. The students should appear to be young and animated, as if done in a childlike style. Include a string represented by a single straight line between the cups, but the line doesn't necessarily connect perfectly to each cup. Use bright colors for the students' clothing; one student is wearing a red shirt and the other in blue. No sound waves or labels should be visible.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing involves effort consistent with a beginning level understanding. The student draws two students with cups, indicating an attempt to depict a string telephone, but the connections might not be accurately shown, and the drawing lacks labels or an understanding of sound transmission and distances. The simplicity and childlike style match the minimal conceptual grasp as described in the level criteria."
