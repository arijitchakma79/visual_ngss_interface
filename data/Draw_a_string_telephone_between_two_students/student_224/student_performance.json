  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw two students with unconnected cups or unrecognizable objects that may represent an attempt to show communication.",
    "The student may show the string but without proper attachment or alignment between the cups and students."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to be able to label parts of the device correctly (e.g., may not label string or cups correctly).",
    "The student cannot accurately demonstrate or show an understanding of how sound travels through the string from one cup to another (e.g., may show sound waves incorrectly or not at all).",
    "The student probably cannot depict a working distance between students where communication is possible (e.g., students may be drawn too far apart without a string or too close with no clear distance).",
    "The student cannot explain how the device solves long-distance communication issues through their drawing (e.g., may not show any indication of solving a distance problem).",
    "An attempt to annotate or describe the benefits of communicating over distances is likely absent or incorrect (e.g., annotations may be unrelated or missing)."
