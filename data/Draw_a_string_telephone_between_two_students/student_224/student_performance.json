  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a string telephone setup with two students at either end, clearly depicting the connection and positioning required for it to work.",
    "The student can show how the design uses cups (or cans) and a string, demonstrating how sound can travel through the string between the two students.",
    "The student can illustrate the concept that the string must be taut to transmit sound effectively by showing a straight line between the cups.",
    "The student can include additional annotations or labels indicating the flow of sound waves from one cup to the other through the string.",
    "The student can highlight the importance of string tension, including details, such as no sagging in the middle, to indicate effective sound transmission."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully explain how external factors (like background noise or obstacles) might affect the communication efficiency of the string telephone, or may include such details only tangentially (minor gap).",
    "The student might slightly misrepresent the size or proportion of elements, such as the relative size of the cups versus the students, without affecting understanding (minor gap)."
