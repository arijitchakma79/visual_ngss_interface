  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw a string telephone between two people. I’ll start with the two students on either side of the paper. They need to be far enough to show that talking would normally be difficult without a phone. I’ll draw one student on the left and another on the right, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth. I remember cups are part of the phone, so I'll draw them clearly. Now, I’ll connect the cups with a string. It should be taut because I think that's necessary for the sound to travel. I'll label the cup as 'sender' and the one on the other side as 'receiver,' but I might forget to do this on both sides. I’ll show sound moving from the cup on the left with arrows pointing to the right. I’ll use different colors so it's clear – maybe red for the cups, blue for the string, and green for the sound arrows. I’m not sure if the arrows need anything else, but I’ll try to make them visible.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a string telephone showing two students: one on the left and one on the right. Each student holds a cup to their mouth or ear connected by a taut blue string. The cups are red. There are green arrows indicating sound movement from the left cup towards the right, showing the direction of sound travel. The cups are labeled with terms ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’, but inconsistently, perhaps one label is missing. The drawing is colorful and sketched in a simple, childlike style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it includes all the basic elements of a string telephone, such as students, cups, and string. The colors help distinguish different parts of the drawing, aligning with the student's proficiency in making elements clear. It captures the student's common struggle by having incomplete labeling and possibly unclear indications of sound movement, reflecting the inconsistency in labeling which is something they might miss."
