  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the two students at opposite ends of the page. I'll make sure they look like they are about the same size and have some good details on them. One student will hold a cup close to their mouth, and the other will have a cup near their ear. I remember that the string needs to be tight between them, so I'll draw a straight line for the string. That shows the tension I learned about that helps the sound travel better. I'll put some arrows or lines that show the sound moving from one cup to the other, but I’m not sure how to make those look exactly like sound waves, so they'll just be some wavy lines. I think cups are fine to use for this drawing, even though I could also use cans. I'm not sure about making the distance between the students very precise or showing scale exactly, so they might look a bit very close to each other.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with two students facing each other. Each student holds a cup up to their mouth and ear, connected by a straight string. The string should be taut, clearly showing that it's essential for the sound to travel. Add some wavy lines or arrows around the string to suggest sound is moving through it. The setting is a simple outdoor background with grass and a few trees. The students are cartoon-styled with bright colors; one student has a red shirt, and the other has a blue shirt. The cups are yellow and the string is white. The scene should be vibrant, friendly, and show the string telephone setup in a straightforward way.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt is designed to reflect the student's proficiency level by including two distinct students with cups, a taut string, and some attempt to depict sound traveling. The wavy lines symbolize sound waves, even though they may not perfectly portray how sound truly travels. The task level isn't concerned with precise scaling between students, so the image may not accurately represent the exact distance, but instead preserve the clear communication of the string telephone concept using playful and colorful illustrations."
