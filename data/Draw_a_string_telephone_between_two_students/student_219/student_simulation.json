  "Reasoning": "I’ll start drawing two students facing each other, since they’re the ones using the string telephone. I’ll make sure they’re clearly drawn with simple features so they look like kids about my age. I remember that a string telephone needs a string and two cups. I’ll draw a cup in each student’s hand and a string connecting these cups. For the communication part, I'll make the student on the left speak into their cup and the student on the right listen. I know I should show sound traveling, so I’ll draw wavy lines emanating from the left student’s mouth and moving along the string to the right student, representing the sound waves. Hmm, sound is invisible and moves in waves, not solid lines, but sometimes I accidentally draw solid lines instead. Now I’ll try to label the drawing to show how it works. I’ll label the lines as 'sound waves', but I might confuse and write 'talking waves' too. I should include labels for the cups and string to make it clear, but I might forget to label the string or put the wrong label entirely.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful hand-drawn illustration of two students using a string telephone. The students are facing each other, each holding a cup with a string connecting the two cups tightly. One student is speaking into a cup, while the other is listening with their cup to their ear. Wavy lines indicating sound waves travel from the speaking student's mouth along the string to the listening student. Some lines may mistakenly be solid. Labels are present, such as 'sound waves', but there may be a mix-up with terms like 'talking waves'. The drawing is neat but has some missing or incorrect labels on components like cups or strings. The overall drawing style is simple, suitable for elementary level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including the key elements of the task: drawing both students, illustrating the string telephone with cups and string, and representing sound waves as they communicate. It also incorporates what the student struggles with, like sometimes showing solid lines for sound waves and occasionally using incorrect terminology or missing labels. This reflects a realistic representation of the student's skill level and understanding, aligning with the given level description 'Proficient'."
