  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a problem where two people need to communicate over a distance, showing two distinct students at a distance from each other.",
    "The student can draw a basic string telephone device using simple shapes like cups and strings, with a reasonable connection depicted between the two students.",
    "The student can show the string being used to send and receive sound information, likely with arrows indicating the direction of sound travel.",
    "The student can include some labels or features that describe the use of sound, such as labels on the cups or the string indicating 'sound travels here' or 'speaking side'.",
    "The student can depict basic materials like paper cups and string in the drawing.",
    "The student can provide a simple explanation, either written or in the drawing itself, about how the device helps solve the problem of communication over distance."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may include incomplete labels, possibly missing key explanations like how sound waves work *(minor oversight in labeling)*.",
    "The student might not fully illustrate how the string is taut for effective sound transmission, leading to a less clear understanding of sound mechanics *(still showed, but misunderstand the importance of string tension)*."
