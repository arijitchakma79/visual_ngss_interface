  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have minor issues with the clarity or precision of arrows or lines indicating sound travel (e.g., arrows might not be perfectly straight or consistent).",
    "The student might not label all parts of the drawing, such as failing to label the string or cups (student assumes it's self-explanatory).",
    "The student might omit details in the explanation, such as specific acoustic properties involved (e.g., vibrations in the string), due to focusing mostly on the practical operation."
