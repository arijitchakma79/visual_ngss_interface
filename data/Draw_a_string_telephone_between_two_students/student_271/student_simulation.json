  "Reasoning": "I remember the task is to draw a string telephone between two students, so I'll start by sketching two stick figure students, one on each side of the paper. They are standing apart, with some distance clearly showing between them. I'll make sure each has a cup near their mouth or ear. I'll draw a simple line connecting the two cups to represent the string. I know the sound travels through the string, so I’ll draw arrows from one cup, along the string, to the other cup to show that. I'm aiming to make the arrows clear, but they might not all be perfectly straight or consistently spaced. I should draw the cups and the string in different colors to make them more recognizable. Finally, I'll add a short description below the drawing. I’ll explain briefly that the string telephone works because the sound travels as vibrations along the string from one person to the other. I might not go into detail about how the vibrations actually work, I know they are important but it's more important to me to show the basic communication process.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figure students standing apart, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth. Connect the cups with a red line to represent a string. Add wavy arrows traveling from one cup to the other along the string to indicate the direction of sound. Use simple colors—blue for one cup and green for the other. The drawing should have a handwritten note underneath explaining that sound travels through the vibrating string to help them communicate. The style should be simple like a child's drawing, with some uneven arrows and no precise labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities to illustrate the basic setup of a string telephone, including separate students, a connecting string, and simple sound representation with arrows. The minor issues are incorporated, like uneven arrows and lack of labels, as the student might assume the string and cups are self-explanatory. The prompt reflects the student's level by depicting all essential elements with some simplicity in explanation, focusing chiefly on operation over acoustic details."
