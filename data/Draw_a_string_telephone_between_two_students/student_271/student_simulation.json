  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two students standing a little apart to show they need to communicate over a distance. I remember they have to be distinct, so I'll give them different hairstyles and clothes. Next, I'll draw a string telephone. I'll use simple shapes like two paper cups and a string connecting them. I know I should make the string straight to show sound can travel, but I'm not sure how taut it needs to be. I think I'll show sound traveling with arrows from one cup to the other. I'll write 'sound travels here' on the string and maybe label one cup as the 'speaking side' to make it clear. I understand sound somehow travels through the string, but I don't remember exactly how sound waves work. I'll try my best to make the drawing clear even though I might miss a few labels.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two cartoon-style students standing apart with different clothes and hairstyles. They are connected by a simple string telephone made of paper cups and a straight string. The string should have arrows along it indicating sound travel direction. Label the string 'sound travels here' and one cup as 'speaking side'. Use bright colors for the students' clothes and simple shapes for the string telephone. The drawing should look like a childâ€™s sketch with some labels and effort to show communication happening.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt includes two distinct students with clear differences, a depiction of a string telephone with sound transmission indicated by arrows, and labels for clarity, aligning with what the student can achieve. The tautness of the string might not be perfectly illustrated, and sound mechanics like the function of sound waves might be incomplete or misunderstood, reflecting the student's limitations."
