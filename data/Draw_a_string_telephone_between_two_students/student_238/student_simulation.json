  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figures to represent the two students. I remember I need to connect them with a string, so I’ll draw a line between them. I think I need cups for the telephone, so I’ll draw a cup on each end of the string, but I’m not sure if they’re exactly right. Now, I should label some parts. I'll try to label the cups and maybe the string, though my labels might not be totally clear. I remember something about sound waves, but I'm not sure how to draw them, so I'll skip that part. It looks like the string might droop a bit in the middle, but I think it still shows a connection.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple stick figures with basic features, representing two students. Connect them with a slightly droopy line for the string. At each end of the string, include a basic representation of a cup. Add partial and unclear labels near the cups and string. Use basic colors like blue for the string, pink for the cups, and black for the stick figures. The style should be a child's drawing, with imperfect lines and a sense of effort, but not perfectly aligned or labeled.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to include basic elements like stick figures, a connecting string, and cups, showing some understanding of the string telephone. Since they struggle with label clarity and sound wave depiction, the labels are included but are described as partial and unclear, and sound waves are absent. The droopy string demonstrates the student's common error in failing to depict the string as taut."
