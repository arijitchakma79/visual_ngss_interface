  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students. They need to be standing apart, so I'll leave some space between them to show the distance. Now, I'll give each one a paper cup. These cups are going to be the part of our string telephone that captures and receives sound. Next, I'll draw a straight line connecting the two cups. This will be the string that carries the sound waves. I need to remember to draw some kind of line, like a dashed or curvy line, on the string to represent sound waves, but sometimes I forget to make those lines touch both cups consistently. Maybe I'll draw them closer to the cup this time. Now, I’ll need to label the 'cups' and 'string'. I'll write 'cups' near the cup in each student’s hand and 'string' close to the line between them. I know that a tight string is important, but I might forget to show or explain that clearly. Finally, I think I'll add a brief description somewhere explaining that this setup helps us communicate, but I might not remember to say that it works without electricity.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a string telephone with two students using it. Each holds a paper cup at their ear or mouth, connected by a straight string. Dashed or curvy lines run along the string to show sound waves, although they might not consistently touch the cups. The students are about several feet apart. Labels like 'cups' and 'string' are visible, explaining their roles. The drawing should use colored pencils or crayons for a vibrant look. The environment is a simple outdoor setting with a grassy ground beneath the students. Overall, it should look like an earnest effort by a proficient student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes all the key elements: students, cups, a connecting string, and some representation of sound waves, although not perfectly placed. It includes labeled parts ('cups' and 'string'), demonstrating partial understanding. The student might fail to consistently depict the importance of string tension in the drawing, which reflects their level of proficiency. The lack of a detailed explanation about the device working without electricity aligns with the student's constraints."
