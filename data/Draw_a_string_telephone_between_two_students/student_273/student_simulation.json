  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a string telephone between two people. I'll start by drawing two stick figures because they're easy to make and they kind of look like people. I'll put them next to each other since that's how I imagine a conversation. Now, I remember that there should be a string in a string telephone. I'll draw a single line connecting the two stick figures. I don't think I need to add anything else because I don't really know how this works exactly. I think there might be cups involved, but I'm not sure where to put them or how they should look. I'll just leave my drawing like this. I don't think the position of the figures or the connection of the string matter too much, as long as they're connected somehow.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing with a white background, showing two stick figures standing close together. They are connected by a single straight line, which loosely represents a string. The line is random and doesn't attach to any specific shapes like cups. The scene is uncomplicated, and the figures are unadorned to focus on the basic concept. Use black for the stick figures and line only, no additional colors or devices like cups are present.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capability to draw simplified representations of people and a string type of connection. It avoids showing any detailed understanding of how a string telephone functions or includes elements like cups, reflecting their minimal understanding. The figures and string are close together without meaningful context, fitting what the student 'cannot' do, while adhering to the 'can' actions of indicating people and a connecting string."
