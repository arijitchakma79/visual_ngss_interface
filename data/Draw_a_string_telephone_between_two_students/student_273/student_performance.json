  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a basic string telephone with two cups connected by a string between two depicted students.",
    "The student can show dashed or curvy lines representing sound waves traveling through the string.",
    "The student can include some details about the distance between the two students and the length of the string.",
    "The student can label key parts of the device, such as 'cups' and 'string', and describe their importance in the communication process."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently apply symbols to show sound waves, occasionally omitting them or placing them incorrectly (e.g., waves may not touch both cups consistently).",
    "The student might inadequately explain the importance of the string's tension for sound transmission (student may not realize the need for a tight string).",
    "The student may provide a less detailed explanation on how this device resolves the communication problem entirely, potentially omitting the benefit of not needing technology or electricity."
