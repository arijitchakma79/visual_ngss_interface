  "Reasoning": "I'm going to start by drawing two students, one on each side. I think I'll put a cup in each student's hand, and they should face each other. Now, I'll connect the cups with a string to show how they communicate. I remember that sound travels through the string, so I'll try to add some wavy lines near the string to represent that, maybe even some arrows to show direction, but I'm not entirely sure it looks right. Next, I'll label the cups and string, though I might forget to do this for all parts or be inconsistent. I should put the students at a little bit of distance, but I might accidentally draw them too close. I won’t worry about labeling 'sound' or explaining the materials in depth because that part is still a bit confusing to me.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image showing two cartoon-style students, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth in vibrant primary colors. The students are standing with a string connecting the cups. Arrows or wavy lines are depicted around the string to suggest sound movement, but may be inconsistently placed. Labels for 'cup' and 'string' might be present but are not standard across the image. The students are roughly facing each other but might be drawn close together.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student’s ability to show a basic setup of a string telephone with two students and a connected string. The attempt to depict sound traveling through the string is noted, though possibly unclear with inconsistent use of arrows. The drawing reflects the student's developmental level by presenting an emerging understanding with basic elements shown, such as the structure but not fully explaining the functioning or communication aspect with proper space and labels."
