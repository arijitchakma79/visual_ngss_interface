  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic string telephone setup, showing cups connected by a string.",
    "The student can attempt to illustrate sound traveling through the string, possibly represented by wavy lines or arrows.",
    "The student can draw two students holding cups at either end of the string."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly indicate how sound travels through the string, possibly omitting directional arrows or incorrectly labeling sound movement (e.g., showing sound moving through the air instead of the string).",
    "The student may not fully demonstrate how the device solves the problem of long-distance communication (e.g., students are standing too close together or lacking a label such as 'sound' near the string).",
    "The student might not label all the parts consistently, such as omitting labels for 'cups' or 'string' or doing so inconsistently.",
    "The student might not effectively show the importance of the materials used, such as why cups and string are necessary (e.g., drawing improper materials or sizes)."
