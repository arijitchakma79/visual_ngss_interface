  "Reasoning": "Okay, I know I have to draw two students using a string telephone. I'll start by drawing one student on the left side of the paper. I want them to look like they are holding a cup to their ear, so I'll carefully draw their arm up and the cup in their hand. Next, I'll draw the second student on the right side with their hand holding a cup against their mouth. It should look like they're talking into it. I'll connect the cups with a straight line to show the string. It’s important for them to use this to communicate over a distance, so I'll try to make the string straight, though I might make one side a little longer by accident. I'll label the string and each cup so it's clear they are part of the string telephone. I'll also write 'sound travels here' or draw sound waves near the string. Finally, to show other communication devices, maybe I'll sketch a simple drawing of a phone or walkie-talkie in the corner so it’s clear that people use various devices to talk over long distances.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two students using a string telephone. Place one student on the left holding a cup to their ear and a second student on the right holding a cup to their mouth. Connect the cups with a straight string. Add labels showing 'sound waves’ near the string. Include small drawings of a phone and a walkie-talkie in the corner. Use vivid colors with detailed features for the students and cups. The drawing style should mimic that of an enthusiastic student's illustration, with slightly uneven but realistic elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's ability to draw a clear representation of a string telephone, capturing the essential elements like students, cups, and string. The addition of sound waves and extra communication devices meets the expectation of illustrating the concept that people rely on such devices for communication at a distance. Minor discrepancies, like a slightly uneven string, align with the student’s natural variation capacity."
