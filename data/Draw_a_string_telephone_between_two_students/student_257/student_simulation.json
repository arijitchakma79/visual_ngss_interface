  "Reasoning": "I'll draw two people because they need to communicate over a long distance. I'll put them on opposite sides of the page. I remember that a string telephone needs cups and a string. I'll draw each person holding a cup. Now, I'll connect the cups with a straight line for the string, making sure it's stretched tight. Let me label the parts: I'll write 'cup' on each cup and 'string' on the line connecting them. Oops, I might have forgotten to label the string. I'll show how sound travels using arrows; I'll draw some starting at one person's mouth and towards the other person's ear. I'm not sure if all arrows are placed right, but I'll try my best. I know sound travels from cup to cup, but I'm not really showing how far apart they are. Anyway, this should show that they are talking to each other using this device.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil and crayon drawing of a string telephone setup with two children at opposite sides of the image. Each child holds a colorful plastic cup, one red and one blue. A taut string connects the two cups. Labels are handwritten next to the cups, but the label for the string is missing. A few arrows in a faded color show sound traveling from one cup to the other, though not consistently placed. The background is blank.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures what the student can do, like illustrating two people using a string telephone, labeling the cups, and trying to show sound traveling between them. It also reflects the areas where the student struggles, such as sometimes omitting a label for the string, not fully showing the long distance aspect, and placing arrows inconsistently to show sound travel. The use of pencil and crayon simulates the effort and level of understanding for a proficient-level student."
