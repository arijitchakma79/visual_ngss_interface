  "Reasoning": "I think I need to draw a picture of two kids trying to communicate with each other. I'll start by drawing two stick figures since that's how I usually draw people. Maybe one is on the left side and the other on the right. They should look like they're ready to do something together. I remember something about using cans to talk to each other. I'll draw two circles that can be cans, one for each kid. I'm not really sure how to connect them, so I’ll just leave it like this for now. I wish I could remember more about how they’re supposed to talk to each other. Maybe if I draw something else around them it'll look like they're doing something interesting. I don’t really remember any lines or strings, and I don’t think I’ll add those. I also don't know how to show sound in the picture, so I'll skip that part. I think I'm done.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing using simple lines and shapes, depicting two stick figure children facing each other. One child is on the left and the other on the right, each holding a circle that represents a can. The physical context doesn’t suggest any connection between the circles. The figures are drawn with minimal detail, and the background is left empty or with a simple addition like a line for the ground. The drawing is colorful yet simplistic, without any text or labels. There are no lines representing a connecting string, or any visual elements suggesting communication or sound waves.",
  "Explaination": "The student successfully drew two stick figures, which meets the ability to depict two people, without contextual distance or communication solutions. The circles represent cans but are not labeled or connected, showing the student's struggle with illustrating a working string telephone. The absence of sound indicators and a string between the cans aligns with the student's inability to demonstrate how sound travels or the device functions. The drawing lacks any communicational context, reflecting minimal understanding as described."
