  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two people to represent students. I remember how to draw stick figures, so I'll make two stick figures. I'll give them both a head, body, arms, and legs to show they are students. Now, I need to draw something that looks like cups because I know they need to be part of the telephone. I'll draw two shapes next to the students that look kind of like cups, maybe a bit round and open at the top, but I'm not sure how to make them face each other. I think there should be a string, but I'm not really sure how it's supposed to go between the cups. I'll add a line between them, but it might be a bit loose and not connecting well. I can't remember how the string helps with communication, so I'll just leave it as it is. The string looks kind of slack and is just hanging there. Iâ€™ll try to add some details to make it look real but might end up making mistakes.",
  "Prompt": "A basic drawing of two smiling stick figures representing students, standing apart. Next to each stick figure is a floating, open-topped cup, angled randomly. A slack and slightly curved line loosely, and ineffectively, connects the cups. The drawing is colorful, using simple colors like blue, red, and green, and has a child-like, simple crayon or pencil style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's current ability level where they can draw basic figures and some components of the machine, like cups. However, they struggle with the correct placement and purpose of the string, which is not taught effectively as slack and random. There is no clear indication of how the device works for communication, aligning with the student's misunderstandings and errors as specified in the task level description."
