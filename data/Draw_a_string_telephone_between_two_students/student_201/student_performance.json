  "CAN": [
    "Draw two figures that represent students, though they might not be attempting communication (students may just be standing without interaction).",
    "Include some elements of the device, such as two shapes that might resemble cups but lacks connection (cups might be floating or not pointed correctly)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Illustrate the string connecting the cups in a manner that shows tension (string may be slack or incorrectly positioned).",
    "Depict the concept of sound transmission through the string (no apparent understanding of how sound is carried by the string).",
    "Show comprehension of how the string telephone works for communication (may be missing, or string is too short, or devices not aligned).",
    "Include relevant features or materials that make the device work, such as proper tension in the string (potentially missing due to the misunderstood role of string tension).",
    "Relate the drawing to real-world technology used for long-distance communication (may include elements like a cell phone or unrelated technology)."
