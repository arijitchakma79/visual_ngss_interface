  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a string telephone with two kids. I remember that string telephones use cups and a string, so I'll start by drawing two cups. I'll make sure to show them with openings, because that's where the sound goes in and out. Now I'll draw a long string connecting the cups together. I think I'm supposed to show kids holding them, so I'll draw one kid at each end. I want to make sure the string is tight and straight between the cups, but I'm not too sure how far apart the kids should be. Maybe I'll draw them a little too close together since I'm not clear on how distance works in this communication. Let's see, I remember something about sound traveling, but I'm not really sure how to show that... Maybe I should draw some arrows, but Iâ€™m not sure where they should point or what they mean. Finally, I'll label the parts. I'll write 'cup' for the cup and 'string' for the string, but oops, I might forget a label or two. I hope this is okay!",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a string telephone with two children, each holding a cup at either end of a connecting string. The cups are open, and the string is taut between them. The children are standing relatively close to each other. The drawing includes basic labels such as 'cup' and 'string', although some labels might be missing. There are a few arrows drawn randomly, attempting to show sound movement, but placed incorrectly. The style is child-like, simple, and colorful, with colors like red for one cup and blue for the other, and the children drawn in shades of brown and green clothes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's attempts: A basic setup of a string telephone is described, showing cups with openings and a connecting string, aligning with the student's understanding. The prompt captures potential struggles by specifying children drawn too close, indicating a lack of understanding of the communication distance. Misplaced arrows highlight confusion about sound travel. Labels are included but might be incomplete, reflecting the student's developing grasp of labeling. The simple and colorful style aligns with the student's developing level description."
