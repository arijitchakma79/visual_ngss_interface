  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people who are going to use the string telephone. I remember that people need to be apart to use this, so I’ll space them out a bit. Now, I need to show the telephone part. I’ll draw two cups at each person’s mouth and ear. I know they have to be connected, so I’ll draw a straight line between the cups to be the string. I’m not too sure how to show the sound traveling through the string. Maybe if I draw some lines around it, like vibrations? But that might not look right. I’ll just leave it like that. Oh, I almost forgot! They need to look like they're talking, so maybe I should add a speech bubble. I’ll put them on grass to show they’re outside and use some colors to make it look nice. I hope this looks like they’re talking through the string.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two children standing apart on a grassy field, each holding a cup to their mouth or ear, connected by a single straight string to form a string telephone. The children appear to be talking or listening, with simple features indicating communication. Use bright colors for their clothes and cups, such as red and blue, to make the drawing lively. The style should be childlike and simplistic, with basic facial expressions and a playful look.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's capability by depicting two children using a string telephone, with a focus on the basic elements of cups and a string. It shows effort to indicate communication through their positioning and use of bright colors. However, it lacks sophisticated depiction of sound waves or vibrations, and there is no explicit display of how sound travels, aligning with the student's struggle to show advanced understanding."
