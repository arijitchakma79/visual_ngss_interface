  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can show two people in the drawing, possibly positioned at a distance, attempting to communicate.",
    "The student can include a basic string connected to two cups in their drawing, representing a string telephone.",
    "The student may attempt to show how sound travels through the string, but the representation might be unclear or abstract."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly demonstrate how the string telephone uses sound to send and receive information (e.g., no indication of sound waves or vibrations).",
    "The student might not consistently use only basic materials in their drawing or add unnecessary elements (e.g., extra wires or a drawn electricity source).",
    "The student may struggle to represent effectively how this simple device provides a solution to the communication over distance (e.g., no clear difference in distance shown, or lack of context that two people are communicating from far away)."
