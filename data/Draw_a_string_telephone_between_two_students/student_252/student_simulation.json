  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students standing apart from each other. I remember that a string telephone uses cups and a string, so I'll draw a cup in each student's hand. The cups need to be connected by a string, so I'll draw that next, making sure the string is straight to show that it's tight. I know that for the sound to travel, the string has to be tight. I'll add some lines or waves coming out from the cup to show sound vibrations traveling through the string. I should make sure to show that sound goes from one cup to another. I'll draw lines indicating sound from one direction to the other. I need to remember to include little annotations, maybe arrows or labels showing sound travel direction, but I might miss some labels or make typos. Overall, I'll try to make the drawing look accurate and complete, but I might not get the string thickness right everywhere.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with two children communicating using a string telephone across a distance. Each child holds a paper or plastic cup connected by a taut string. The string is straight and indicates sound traveling, perhaps with lines or waves showing vibrations. One child talks into the cup, while the other listens. Add small arrows or diagrams on the string to show sound direction, and use some colored annotations, like a blue or red arrow, to depict sound waves. The setting is outdoors in a simple, clear style, with basic color fills for the children and objects. Include small human features and expressions showing communication.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including key elements like the cups, tight string, and sound travel representation. It reflects a complete setup for a string telephone, shows sound direction, and includes some annotations. However, it acknowledges the student's limitations by allowing for the possibility of missing or imperfect labels and does not require precise string thickness depiction, aligning with what the student may not do perfectly."
