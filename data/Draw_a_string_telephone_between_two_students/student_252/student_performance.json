  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate a string telephone with two students, clearly showing the string and connecting cups or cans.",
    "Demonstrate sound traveling through the string, possibly with arrows or lines indicating direction.",
    "Depict the communication between two students using the device, understanding the basic concept of sound travel.",
    "Include some features of the design like tautness of the string, which is generally correct."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Might not fully detail or label how sound specifically travels through the string (e.g., lack of technical annotations).",
    "May overlook the depiction of the communication problem over long distances (e.g., no representation of distance issues).",
    "Could miss or awkwardly show advanced design features like optimal string tension or vibrations (e.g., illustrating loose string).",
    "May reflect a basic understanding of using the technology to stay connected but without elaboration on long-distance context."
