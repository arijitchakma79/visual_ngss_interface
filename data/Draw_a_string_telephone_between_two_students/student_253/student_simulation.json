  "Reasoning": "I know I'm supposed to draw a telephone made out of string, but I'm not sure how it looks. I'll start by drawing two stick figures because I know a telephone is something people use to talk to each other. Let me add some wavy lines between them â€“ this might look like string or a rope, but I'm not sure what to connect it to. I remember there should be some kind of cups, but I don't know how to fit them in. I'll just draw some shapes that might look like cups. I don't really understand how sound would move through or between the lines, so I won't draw anything like that. I'm not sure about naming anything in my drawing - like labeling parts as 'cup' or 'string', so I'll skip that. This drawing shows two people who might talk, but I'm not sure if it really explains how a telephone made out of string works.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing in a child's style featuring two stick figures standing apart from each other. They have thin, wavy lines connecting them which might suggest a string or rope, but there are no visible cups attached to the lines. The figures are on a simple grassy landscape with no detailed background. The drawing includes a few unrelated shapes next to the figures. The colors are bright and simple, like basic crayons or markers, with a focus on blue and green for the ground and the figures in different colors such as red and yellow.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's current understanding and abilities as described. The student can draw people and lines to suggest communication, fulfilling the 'can do' capabilities. However, it fails to accurately represent a functional string telephone with labeled parts, which aligns with the 'cannot do' limitations. The drawing lacks the correct depiction of sound transmission or communication concept, matching the level description as minimal or no understanding."
