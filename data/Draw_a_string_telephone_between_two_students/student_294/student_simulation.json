  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students who need to talk over a distance. I’ll put one on the left and the other on the right, making sure they face each other so it's clear they want to communicate. I remember that they need a string telephone, which includes cups and string. I’ll draw a paper cup in each of their hands, connecting them with a straight line for the string, making sure it’s taut. I think I should label the cups, but I might forget one. I know sound waves move through the string, so I’ll try to draw wavy lines along the string to show this. I also need to ensure the string is drawn straight, as this helps the sound travel better. I’ll use different colors to make the elements clear: blue for the students, red for the string, and purple for sound waves. I know I should indicate holes at the bottom of the cups where the string goes through, but I might miss drawing them. The main thing is to show that the students can talk using this setup.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two cartoon-style children standing at opposite sides of the image, each holding a paper cup to their ear or mouth. The children are colorful, with blue outfits. A bright red string connects the cups, shown as perfectly straight to signify tautness. The background is simple, making the foreground action clear. Purple wavy lines travel along the string, representing sound waves. The cups should appear white, and there might be one labeled. A close examination of the cups might reveal slight omissions like missing holes for the string.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to clearly show the communication setup with colorful, distinct elements like the cups and taut string. The inclusion of sound waves aligns with the student's understanding of sound transmission. However, the potential omission of cup holes and label inconsistency reflects the minor details the student might overlook, consistent with their level description."
