    "The student may not accurately show how the communication over the string telephone works, possibly missing essential details like the tautness of the string affecting sound transmission.",
    "The student might have a vague representation of sound traveling through the string, possibly missing out on showing sound waves or the direction of sound travel (e.g., arrows going the wrong way or missing entirely)."
