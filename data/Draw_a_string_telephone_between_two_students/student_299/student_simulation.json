  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students, one on each side of the paper. I remember that a string telephone needs two cups, so I’ll draw each student holding a cup up to their ears. Now I need to connect the cups with a line to show the string. The teacher said the string needs to be tight, so I’ll draw it straight between the cups. To show that sound travels along the string, I’ll draw some arrows or lines in the middle of the string pointing from one cup to the other. Since I'm not that sure about how to show sound vibration exactly, I’ll just make sure it looks like the arrows are showing the movement along the string. I know the cups make the sound louder, but I'm not sure how to draw that part, so I might leave out any explanation about the cups amplifying sound. I'll use bright colors to make it look nice. Let’s color the cups blue, the string red, and give each student different colored clothes.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of two students using a string telephone. Each student is on opposite sides of the image, holding a blue cup to their ear. The cups are connected by a straight red string, showing it is taut. Arrows or lines are drawn along the string, indicating the travel of sound from one cup to the other. Both students are smiling, and they are wearing vibrantly colored clothes against a simple background. Style is child-like with bold outlines and simple, bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt emphasizes the main elements the student can do: depicting the string telephone with cups and a string, showing the concept of sound travel with arrows or lines, and the importance of the string being taut. It does not request additional elements such as labels or detailed explanations of sound amplification, acknowledging the student's potential struggle with those aspects. The child-like style and bright colors match the effort expected at their proficiency level."
