  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students standing some distance apart, making sure they look like they're ready to talk to each other. I'll give them simple features to show they're real students and not just stick figures. I remember that the important part is how they are using the string telephone to communicate. Next, I'll draw a line to connect the two students—this will be the string of the string telephone. At the end of each string, I’ll draw a cup held by both students to their ears or mouths. This shows that they're using the cups to speak and listen. I’ll make sure the string is straight, which I remember is important for it to work. Then, I'll add arrows along the string to show the path the sound travels. I'll label the arrows to make it clear. Maybe I won’t need a detailed background since it's more about the string telephone and how it works. I know we should focus on the elements of communication over distance. Finally, I'll add a title like 'Communication over Distance' at the top to indicate the purpose of this setup. I think I’ll leave most of the background blank since the task is about the string telephone itself.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two children standing at a distance, using a string telephone. The child on the left is a girl with short brown hair, wearing a blue shirt and jeans. The child on the right is a boy with curly black hair, wearing a green shirt and shorts. Each child is holding a small red plastic cup to their ear or mouth, connected by a taut white string, showing the communication device in use. There are labeled arrows along the string indicating the direction of sound travel from one child to the other. The background is simple and not highlighted, focusing mainly on the string telephone. Above the scene, a title reads 'Communication over Distance'. The drawing has a colorful and child-friendly style with clear and bold labels.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's ability to draw a complete and accurate representation of two students using a string telephone. The key elements like the students, cups, string, and direction of sound are clearly illustrated. The prompt highlights the visualization of the device as a communication tool, aligning with the student's capability to depict the problem-solving aspect. It also includes minimal background details, adhering to the focus on the device itself rather than the environment, reflecting the student's occasional omission of such contexts."
