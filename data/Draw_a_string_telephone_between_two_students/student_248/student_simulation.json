  "Reasoning": "I'm supposed to draw a string telephone. Okay, first I'll draw two students. I know they need to hold cups, so I'll draw one holding a cup in each hand. I'll connect their cups with a line to show the string. I remember that the string is important, even if it's not tight. I'll also try to show that they are talking by drawing some lines or waves coming from their mouths to the cups. I don't really understand how the sound travels though or why the string must be tight, so I think the line can just hang there. I feel like something is missing, but I'm not sure how to draw sound waves or show how the string helps with communication.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two students facing each other, each holding a cup to their mouth. A loose, slightly curved line connects the cups, indicating a string telephone. One student has lines or waves drawn from their mouth to the cup, showing they are trying to communicate. The drawing is in basic, child-like colored pencil style with simple, bright colors. The string is not tight, and no additional sound-related features are in the drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'can' section by showing two students with cups and a connecting string, and an attempt to illustrate communication with lines from the mouth. It matches the 'cannot' section by depicting a loose string, lack of sound wave direction, and no additional mechanisms or detailed problem-solving in the drawing, reflecting a developing level of understanding."
