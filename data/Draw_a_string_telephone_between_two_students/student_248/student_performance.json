  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [

  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently draw the string tight, showing an understanding that it needs to be stretched for sound to travel effectively *(may show slack without realizing its impact)*.",
    "Clearly depict how the string helps send communication over a distance, such as sound waves traveling along lines *(may lack directional arrows or indication of sound transfer)*.",
    "Include features like resonant cups or any additional sound-related mechanisms in the drawing *(often not included at this level)*.",
    "Explain or illustrate how the string telephone solves the problem of distant communication through detailed labeling or complex illustration."
