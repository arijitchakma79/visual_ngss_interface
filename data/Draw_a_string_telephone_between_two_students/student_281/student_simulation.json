  "Reasoning": "I know I need to draw two people talking to each other with something between them. I think I’ll start by drawing two kids. I know they need something in their hands, maybe I’ll draw cups because I’ve seen people using cups to talk. I'll connect the cups with a line - I guess that's supposed to be the string. I know there should be some kind of connection, but I'm not really sure how it works. I won’t label anything because I'm not sure what to say. I'll just show the two kids holding cups connected by a line, but I won't show or explain how they would talk through this setup. I remember this is supposed to be about sound, but I don't really get how the sound travels or anything like that. As long as I show them holding cups and a line between them, that should be okay.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing of two stick figure students standing facing each other. Each student is holding a simple, solid-colored cup close to their mouth or ear. The cups are connected by a straight line, meant to represent a string. The figures are drawn with simple circles for heads, straight lines for bodies and limbs, and basic facial expressions. The background is plain white, with no additional details or labels. The style is basic and colorful, resembling a crayon drawing, reflecting a young child's simple artistic style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including two figures with cups and a line connecting them. It reflects the student's successful identification of basic components (cups and line) but misses the scientific concept of sound transmission, as the student does not understand or depict how the string acts as a medium for sound, nor do they label any elements to explain communication. The simplicity and lack of interaction or sound depiction show the student's beginning level understanding."
