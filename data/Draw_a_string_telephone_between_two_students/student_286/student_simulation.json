  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the two students who are trying to communicate with each other over a distance. I'll show them facing each other, holding cups to their mouths and ears to indicate they’re talking and listening. I need to make sure their gestures are clear so the viewer knows they’re communicating. The next part is drawing the string telephone. I think I’ll use a couple of tin cans or plastic cups connected by string. I want to make sure the string is taut and clearly connects the two. To show how sound travels, I’ll draw arrows along the string pointing from the student who is 'speaking' to the one who is 'listening'. I'll label the cups and string, and maybe draw some sound waves from the cup of the speaking student. I need to remember to write a few notes explaining how this technology helps them communicate over the distance. Maybe I’ll write something like ‘String carried sound’ near the string. Even though the string might not be perfectly straight or the cups might not be exactly the same size, I’ll try my best to make it look right. I might miss labeling something, but I'll do my best to include all key information.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful scene showing two students using a string telephone to communicate. The students, a boy and a girl, are shown standing a few meters apart facing each other. Each holds a cup (made from a bright color, perhaps red and blue) with the cup edges held to their mouths and ears respectively. The cups are connected by a thin, taut white string. From the cup near the boy’s mouth, draw dotted lines indicating sound waves traveling along the string toward the girl’s ear. Near the arrow, include small annotations like 'sound travels here'. Capture the students interacting with gestures indicating they are communicating. Include minimal background detail to focus on the interaction and device.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's advanced skill by ensuring accurate representation of the string telephone and communication gestures. It highlights the components (cups and string) as outlined in the 'CAN' section, and it shows understanding of sound transmission with arrows. The scene is descriptive, vibrant, and educational, fulfilling the student's advanced level without delving into minor inaccuracies such as imperfect string or cup sizes indicated in the 'CANNOT' section."
