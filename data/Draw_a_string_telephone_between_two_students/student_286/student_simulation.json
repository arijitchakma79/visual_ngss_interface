  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students who need to talk to each other from a distance. I think they’d look good with happy expressions, because communication is fun! I'll draw each student holding a cup, and then I’ll draw a line to show the string connecting the cups. I know the string should be straight because someone once told me that helps with the talking. Now, for the materials, I’m going to make sure that the cups really look like cups by adding some details, maybe like the bottom of the cup. But I’m not exactly sure how the string attaches to the cup, so I'll just have the line go right into it. I think adding some motion signals or lines around the mouth of one of the students could show that they're speaking, although I keep forgetting about showing how sound travels properly, like inside the string. When it comes to distance, I'm thinking they just need to stand far apart on the page, so it feels like they’re talking across a long distance, but I won't really measure it or anything like that.",
  "Prompt": "A simple hand-drawn sketch of two children standing a moderate distance apart. Each child is holding a cup, and the cups are connected by a straight line to represent a string. The children are drawn in a casual, youthful style with colors that reflect an innocent portrayal of children, like blue and red clothing. The scene includes minimal details, like the basic shape of the cups, and the string entering the cup without showing precise attachment. There are motion lines around one child's mouth to indicate speaking, but no scientific representation of sound waves or tension in the string. Overall, the style is that of a casual, child-like drawing that aims to show a simple understanding, using crayons or colored pencils with basic colors like red, blue, yellow, and green.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's level by focusing on representing the basic components like the cups and the string, along with the essential detail of the straightness of the string. It reflects the simplicity expected at this developmental level by not including advanced concepts like sound wave propagation or string tension, which the student struggles with. The use of colors and drawing style hints at a more elementary depiction which aligns with the student's ability to show a simple string telephone connection without complex features."
