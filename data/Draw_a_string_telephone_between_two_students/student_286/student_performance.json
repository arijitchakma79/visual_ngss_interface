  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a problem where people need to communicate over a long distance, but may not clearly define what 'long distance' means.",
    "The student can attempt to draw a basic string telephone device used for communication, showing two students with cups connected by a line to represent a string.",
    "The student can depict the use of materials like cups and string, but with limited detail (e.g., may not show how string is attached to the cups)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly label or describe all key features of the design that allow it to send or receive sound over a distance (e.g., may not label string or specify correct tension).",
    "The student is likely unable to depict the expected features accurately, showing how the device solves the communication problem using sound (e.g., might omit sound waves or their direction).",
    "The student may misunderstand how sound travels through the device, such as drawing sound incorrectly along the outside of the string *(student doesnâ€™t understand sound transmission)*."
