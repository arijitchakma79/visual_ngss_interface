  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two people who need to communicate over a long distance, with each person holding one end of the string telephone.",
    "The student can illustrate a basic string telephone device, showing a string connecting two tin cans or cups.",

    "The student can use labels or brief notes to describe components like 'string', 'cup', and indicate that sound travels through the string."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully represent the idea that sound vibrations travel through the string accurately (e.g., lack of directionality in arrows).",
    "The student might inconsistently label all parts of the device (e.g., 'tin can' labeled but 'string' is not).",
    "The student may not completely explain in notes how sound exactly travels through the string (e.g., notes include 'sound goes through string' without mentioning vibrations)."
