  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students standing a little apart, facing each other. I'll draw each student holding a paper or plastic cup up to their ear and mouth, holding a string that connects the two cups. I need to make sure the string is taut and straight to show that the phone works properly. Next, I'll add some lines or arrows on the string to show the sound waves traveling between the cups. Oh, I should label the parts of my drawing. I'll write 'string' on both sides, near each cup. I remember I might forget to label one part sometimes, but I'll be careful to get it right. I'll draw one student with their mouth open and the other with their ear pressed to the cup, making it clear that one is speaking and the other is listening. I need to add a caption; I'll write something like, 'String telephone: the sound travels through the string, allowing them to communicate over a distance.' My picture will use bright colors to make the cups and the string stand out and should mostly look clear and schematic, though I won't worry too much about perfect sound wave curves in the air or string.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of two students using a string telephone. The scene shows one student on the left, speaking into a red cup, and the other student on the right, listening with a blue cup. A taut, straight line represents the string connecting the cups. Arrows on the string indicate sound waves traveling from left to right. The background is simple and schoolground-like, emphasizing the string telephone setup. Use bright colors for the cups and string. Label the string clearly near both cups. One student appears to be speaking with an open mouth, while the other is listening intently. Include a caption at the bottom: 'String telephone: sound travels through the string, allowing communication over distance.' Drawing should be clear and illustrative, focusing on accuracy and completeness of the concept.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the elements the student can portray well, such as the straight string, indication of sound waves, and a successful communication scenario between students. It also reflects the CANNOT elements by not focusing on perfectly drawn sound waves or the rare case of missing labels, minor aspects that do not affect understanding according to the student's skill level."
