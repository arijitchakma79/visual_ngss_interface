  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people who need to talk to each other over a long distance. I remember that they each need to hold one end of the string telephone. I'll draw each of them holding a cup or a tin can. Next, I'll connect the two cups with a string. To show that sound travels, I’ll stretch the string tightly between them. I'll add some wave-like lines or arrows along the string to represent sound waves. I think it’s important to label parts, so I'll write 'cup' next to the cups and 'string' next to the string. However, I don't really understand how to show that the sound is moving through the string accurately. My arrows might not show the right direction exactly. Also, sometimes I forget to label all the parts, like I labelled 'cup' but sometimes miss 'string'. When I write notes, I say things like 'sound goes through string', but I don’t always mention that it involves vibrations because it's a bit confusing.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a string telephone between two students. Each student is holding one end of the telephone made of a cup. There is a tightly stretched string connecting the two cups. Small wave-like lines or arrows should be present along the string to indicate sound waves, though the direction isn't very accurate. There are labels like 'cup' and 'string', but the string might not be consistently labeled. The style should be simple and child-like, using bright colors, such as a red string and blue and yellow cups. The background should be plain, emphasizing the string telephone.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including two people each holding a cup connected by a string, the string is tightly stretched, and there are wave-like lines suggesting sound waves. It also reflects the student's struggles: the direction of sound waves might not be accurate, and there is inconsistent labeling of parts. The notes are included but lack detailed explanation of sound vibrations, which aligns with the student’s misunderstandings and areas where they are not fully proficient."
