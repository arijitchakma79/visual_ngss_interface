  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students holding cups, suggesting a basic setup of a string telephone.",
    "The student may show the string connecting the cups relatively straight, indicating an emerging understanding that the string needs to be tight.",
    "The student can attempt to illustrate sound waves or lines around the studentsâ€™ mouths, suggesting communication through sound."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly depict the string being tightly stretched between the cups, potentially showing it sagging or with slack (misunderstanding of tension requirement).",
    "The student may not effectively illustrate how the string telephone is a technology to overcome communication over distance, possibly omitting any elements showing distance between students.",
    "The student might not explicitly show or label the sound as the method of communication over the string (lack of clarity on how sound travels).",
    "The student may not illustrate or mention the dependence on simple technologies for communication (might not understand the broader context)."
