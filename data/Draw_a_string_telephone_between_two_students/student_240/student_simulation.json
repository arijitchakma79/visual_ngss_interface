  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone. I remember seeing this with cups and a string. I’ll start by drawing two kids, one on each side. I think they should be holding cups, so I’ll draw cups in their hands. Now, I connect the cups with a string between them. I’ve seen the string is supposed to be straight, but I’m unsure how tight it should look, so I’ll draw it kind of loose, maybe with some slack. I remember that the point is for them to talk to each other, so I'll draw lines coming out from one kid's mouth, like they are talking. I’m not sure if that covers everything about how they communicate, but I think it shows that they are trying to talk to each other with the string telephone. I won't indicate anything about the technology or anything like that, but two kids talking should be enough.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two children using a string telephone. One child stands on the left and the other on the right, each holding a paper cup connected by a piece of string. The children are smiling and their mouths are slightly open as if talking. The string is depicted somewhat slack between the cups. There are small wavy lines around the face of one of the children, representing sound. The drawing is colorful and done in a child-like style with bold outlines and basic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to show two students holding cups and suggests a basic setup of the string telephone. The slack in the string reflects the student's misunderstanding of tension requirements. By including wavy lines as sound waves, it shows an attempt to illustrate communication, though it might not clearly show how sound travels over the string. The prompt does not include references to technology or separate distances for communication, reflecting the student’s lack of understanding of those broader concepts."
