  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a problem where people need to communicate over a long distance, such as two children across a playground.",
    "The student can illustrate a simple device, like cups and a string, that uses sound to solve the communication problem.",
    "The student can use provided materials to accurately depict the design of a string telephone, showing details like tightly stretched string between the cups.",
    "The student can show in their illustration how information travels through the device using sound, such as adding arrows to indicate the direction of sound waves.",
    "The student can label the features of the device that allow it to send or receive information, such as labeling 'cups', 'string', 'sound waves'.",
    "The student can demonstrate an understanding of how communicating over distances helps people by including examples in the drawing, such as people sharing messages or calling for help."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally miss labeling a less critical feature or include a minor additional feature without clear correlation to its function (e.g., trying to label sound speed but doing it inconsistently).",
    "The student might show an incomplete explanation of how different tensions on the string can affect sound transmission (e.g., does not clarify what happens if the string is not taut)."
