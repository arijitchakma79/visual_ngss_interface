  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a string telephone between two students. First, I need to show the two children standing far apart, like over a playground, because I remember it’s important to communicate over a long distance. I’ll draw them smiling to show they’re talking to each other. I’ll use two cups, one for each child, and draw a string connecting them. I’ll make sure the string is shown straight and tight, otherwise, the telephone might not work well. I remember to add arrows along the string to show the direction of sound waves moving from one student to the other. Next, I'll label the important parts: 'cups', 'string', and 'sound waves'. Oh, and I should add a scene where one student is needing to call for help or share a message to show how communicating is useful. I’ve got to focus on labeling correctly, even if I sometimes forget less important labels. Also, I know different tensions on the string can change the sound, but I’m not really sure how to show that clearly. So, I'll make sure the string looks tight since I know that works best.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two children standing on a playground with a simple string telephone between them. Use bright colors to show a sunny day. The children are standing apart with colorful paper cups at their ears and mouths, connected by a single, tight string that runs between them, appearing straight. Arrows are drawn along the string to indicate sound waves traveling. Label the cups, string, and sound waves. Add a caption illustrating the usefulness of communicating over distances, like 'Calling for Help' or 'Sharing a Message'. The style should be simple and clear, like a child’s classroom project, focusing on accurately depicting the function of the string telephone.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s strengths, like accurately depicting the string telephone with both tight string and labeled parts. It shows an understanding of how sound travels using direction arrows. The prompt does not overcomplicate aspects the student struggles with, such as variably showing sound transmission with different string tensions, ensuring it remains within their comprehension level, while correctly including examples of communication over distances."
