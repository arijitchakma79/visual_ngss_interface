  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two students facing each other. First, I need to draw them holding cups to their ears or mouths, one student should be listening while the other is talking. I'll make sure to draw a line between the cups to represent the string. I remember that sound travels through the string, so I'll add some lines or arrows coming from one cup and heading to the other, to show that sound is being transferred. I’ll need to label the cups and the string so it’s clear what materials are used. Although I understand sound waves should be there, I might draw them kind of long because I feel that longer waves look louder. I should also give them expressions, maybe one is smiling and the other is concentrating, to show that they are communicating. However, I’m not sure how to show why this is important or when you'd use this in real life, like outside of school.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration showing two cartoon-style students facing each other, each holding a cup connected by a string to create a string telephone. One student is holding a cup to their mouth and smiling, while the other holds a cup to their ear and looks focused, indicating they are listening. Between the two cups, a line represents the string, with simplistic wavy lines or arrows drawn between them to illustrate sound waves traveling. The cups and string are labeled 'cup' and 'string' respectively. The colors are simple and bright, emphasizing a playful and educational tone, with facial expressions clearly indicating communication. The sound waves are drawn disproportionately, longer than they should be.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency level by showing a clear understanding of the physical setup of a string telephone and the basic concept of sound transmission with arrows or lines. The focus is on effective communication between the two students engaging with the device, represented by their expressions. However, the student's misunderstanding of sound wave representation is illustrated by the disproportionate length of the waves, aligning with their difficulty in accurately depicting how sound carries information. The sketch captures a learning context without connecting it to real-world communication solutions, reflecting the student's challenge in contextualizing outside school scenarios."
