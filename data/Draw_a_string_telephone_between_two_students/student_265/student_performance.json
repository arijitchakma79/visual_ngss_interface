  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using a string telephone device to communicate over a distance.",
    "The student can show that the device uses string to connect two points, indicating the communication pathway.",
    "The student can illustrate how sound travels along the string by possibly drawing arrows or wave lines on the string.",
    "The student can depict some materials used to build the string telephone, such as cups or cans.",
    "The student can demonstrate basic understanding that the device is a solution for communication over long distances."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently illustrate how sound travels accurately along the string (e.g., incorrectly drawing the direction of sound waves).",
    "The student might not fully convey the importance of communicating over a distance in real-world situational drawings (e.g., missing context or setting).",
    "Occasionally, materials used may be partially incorrect or unlabelled, leading to confusion about the construction of the device (e.g., using vague shapes without labeling them as cups or cans)."
