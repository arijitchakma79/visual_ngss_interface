  "Reasoning": "I will try to draw two students. I remember that a string telephone needs two people. I'm not sure what they should be doing exactly, but I'll make them both have heads and bodies. Maybe they should be talking to each other, so I'll draw them standing apart. Next, I need to show something like a string. I think it goes between them, so I'll draw a line from one student to the other. I think there should be something at the end of the string, like a cup, but I'm not sure how that all fits together. I don't really know how the sound travels or how they can talk using this string, so I won't add any extra details for that. I'll just try my best and hope it's right.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing showing two students depicted with stick figures. They are standing apart from each other. A single line represents a string stretched between them, but it doesn't connect to their ears or mouths. There are no additional details to show how sound travels through the string. The drawing lacks visible cups or other elements to identify it as a string telephone. The background is plain, emphasizing the figures and the line between them. Use basic colors and a simplistic style typical of young children's art.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately represents what the student understands and misunderstands at their current level. The CAN aspects cover the drawing of two students and a string-like line without a clear understanding of its purpose. The CANNOT parts are reflected in the lack of proper connections, absence of cups, and failure to represent how sound or communication occurs, aligning with the student's minimal understanding."
