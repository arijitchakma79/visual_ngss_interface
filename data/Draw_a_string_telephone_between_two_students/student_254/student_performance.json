  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students clearly holding cups connected by a string, accurately representing a string telephone.",
    "The student can show the string connecting the two cups, indicating the path for sound travel.",
    "The student can illustrate the idea that sound travels through the string by using appropriate symbols, such as lines or arrows, to suggest sound movement.",
    "The student can depict the general concept that the string telephone allows communication even over distances, possibly by showing the students far apart.",
    "The student can use labels to indicate components of the string telephone or name the parts involved (e.g., 'cups', 'string')."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label the parts of the system, such as not labeling both the string and cups in all instances.",
    "The student might not fully illustrate how sound specifically travels through the string, missing details like directional indicators or sound waves.",
    "The student might show the string sagging excessively, which could imply sound can't travel properly through it *(misinterpretation of tautness importance)*.",
    "The student could omit or incorrectly illustrate that the device has an impact on communication over longer distances, potentially drawing the students too close together."
