  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone. First, I’ll start by drawing two people. I'll make them stick figures because that’s simpler. Next, I’ll draw two cups for the string telephone. I remember that each person needs to hold one cup, so I’ll draw the cups close to their mouths or ears. Now, I’ll connect the cups with a string. I think the string is important, so I’ll make it go straight between the two cups. I know I need to label some parts, so I’ll label one of the cups as 'Cup' and the string as 'String'. I’m not really sure if the string should be tight, so I might make it a little saggy. Finally, I’ll try to show sound going through the string, maybe with some lines or arrows near it. I’m not sure about all the labels, so I might miss a few or get them wrong.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figures standing apart with a simple string telephone between them. Each stick figure is holding a cup to their mouth or ear. Connect the cups with a slightly saggy line labeled 'String'. One cup is labeled 'Cup'. Include lines or arrows near the string to suggest sound traveling through it. Use basic colors, like blue for the string and red for the cups, on a plain white background. The drawing is simple with no complex details, aligning with a child's understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw the basic elements of a string telephone: two people, cups, and a string. The string is saggy, showing the student's struggle to convey the importance of tension for sound transmission. Some labels are included, but the student may miss additional necessary labels, aligning with their developing understanding. Sound is suggested through basic visual indicators, though not deeply explained."
