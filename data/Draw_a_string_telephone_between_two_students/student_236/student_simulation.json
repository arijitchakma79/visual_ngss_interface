  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the two students. They should be standing apart so that I can show the string telephone between them. I’ll give each student a cup in their hand. Now, I'll draw a line between the cups to show the string, and I'll try to keep it sort of straight, because I think the string should not be saggy. Labeling is important, so I'll try to write 'cup' next to each cup and 'string' on the line to show what they are. I think the cups and string make the telephone, but I'm not really sure how sound moves along it. I won't draw sound waves because I don't quite understand how to do that correctly. I hope the string looks right, but it's hard to show it’s tight enough to work correctly. I won’t include arrows because I’m not sure how to indicate the sound traveling.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of two students standing apart with simple human features. Each student holds a cup to their ear or mouth. A string connects the cups, drawn with an attempt to look straight but slightly slack. The cups and string are labeled with words 'cup' and 'string' in handwritten text. The background is simple, suggesting an indoor or outdoor setting, with no indication of sound waves or arrows showing sound movement.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by depicting the basic setup of a string telephone with students holding cups connected by a string. The cups and string are labeled, reflecting their understanding of the materials. However, the drawing lacks sound waves and arrows, showing their struggle with illustrating how sound travels. It does not explicitly highlight that tension in the string is critical for function, which aligns with the student's potential misconception about tightness."
