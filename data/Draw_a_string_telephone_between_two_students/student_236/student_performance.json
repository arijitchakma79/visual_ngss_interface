  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student is likely able to show two students holding cups with a string attached between the cups, indicating a basic setup of a string telephone.",
    "The student might depict that the string needs to be somewhat straight, suggesting some understanding that tension is important (may not be completely taut).",
    "The student can label the cups and string, showing an understanding of the materials used in the telephone (though labeling might be inconsistent)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not clearly illustrate how sound travels along the string (e.g., no sound waves indicated or incorrect depiction).",
    "The importance of a taut string for communication may be misunderstood, as the string could appear slack or poorly illustrated as tight (student might think tension doesn't matter).",
    "The student might not accurately explain how the device works to solve the problem of communicating over a distance (e.g., no labels or incorrect labels indicating information flow).",
    "They may not show or label arrows or lines to indicate the direction of the sound waves along the string."
