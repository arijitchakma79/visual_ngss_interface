  "Reasoning": "Alright, I'm going to draw a string telephone between two students. First, I'll draw two students standing apart. I'll use bright colors for their shirts—one in blue and the other in red—so it's clear they are two different people. I remember that I need to show the string telephone, so I'll draw a cup in each student's hand. I'll make the cups green so they stand out. Now, I'll connect the cups with a straight line for the string. I should draw the string tight because loose strings don't work well for sound. Next, I'll add an arrow from one cup to another showing how sound travels through the string. I'll include some labels. I'll write 'sound travels through the string' to explain how it works. I remember it's important to explain why the string needs to be tight, so I'll add a note that says 'tight string = clear sound'. I know this is all about sound traveling, but I might not explain everything about how sound works exactly or might forget that it's not about light. Still, I'm focusing on the tight string and sound. I think that covers it!",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful sketch of a string telephone between two students. One student wears a blue shirt and the other wears a red shirt. Each student holds a green cup to their ear. Connect the cups with a straight, taut black line representing the string. An arrow from the first cup to the second illustrates sound traveling. Include simple labels: 'sound travels through the string' and 'tight string = clear sound'. Use bright colors and a simple cartoon style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate the device—two cups connected by a string, used by two students. The instructions to draw the string tight show understanding of its importance for communication. Labels clarify sound travel. The drawing might lack comprehensive scientific detail, like not fully explaining sound principles or clearly distinguishing it from light-based communication, matching where the student struggles."
