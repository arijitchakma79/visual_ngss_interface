  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a string telephone connecting two students to demonstrate communication over a distance, likely including the two students with a string running between them.",
    "The student can show the use of sound in the design by clearly connecting the cups to the string, implying sound travels through it.",
    "The student can use basic lines or arrows to represent how sound travels between the two endpoints, though these may not be perfectly consistent.",
    "The student can illustrate the purpose of the telephone by showing the two students speaking and listening, indicating an attempt to solve the problem of communicating over a distance.",
    "The student can label key features such as the cups and string, showing an understanding that these parts function together to transmit sound, albeit potentially with some labels missing or not fully descriptive."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently apply arrows or lines to indicate the direction of sound travel, occasionally omitting them or placing them ambiguously (student is not fully consistent in representing sound direction).",
    "The student might not fully or accurately show the materials used in the string telephone beyond basic cups and string (student does not consider material properties influencing sound travel)."
