  "Reasoning": "Alright, let's draw a string telephone between two students. I’ll start by drawing two stick figures, one on each end of the paper. They represent the two students. I'll draw a cup next to each student – one can be holding the cup, and the other can look like they're listening. Now, I'll connect the cups with a straight line to show the string. That's important because it shows how the sound travels between the two. I should add some arrows on the string to show the sound moving, but I sometimes forget to do this all the way. So I'll draw a couple of arrows in between the cups, but maybe not all along the string. I know the sound travels through the string, so these arrows go in both directions. For labels, I'll write 'cup' near the cups and 'string' along the line, so it's clear what they are. I think that shows how it works to communicate over a distance. I might forget to label every part or describe the materials, but I think this should show most of the important bits.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two stick figure students, one on each side holding a cup. Connect the cups with a straight, thin line representing a string. Draw a few arrows along the string in both directions to depict sound travel, but not covering the entire length. Label the cups with the word 'cup' and the string with the word 'string'. The students should be drawn with cartoon-style expressions to show one speaking and the other listening, using basic colors like primary tones for cups and brown or gray for the string. The drawing should be simple, child-like, and colorful.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures most aspects the student is capable of illustrating. It includes students, cups, and string, showing an understanding of the string telephone. The use of arrows represents sound travel but does not completely cover the string, aligning with the student sometimes omitting direction indicators. Labels are included, but as per the student's capability, they might not be comprehensive or fully descriptive beyond basic terms. The cartoon style and basic colors reflect the student's grade level and effort put forth, indicating an understanding but not detailed material properties or exhaustive explanations."
