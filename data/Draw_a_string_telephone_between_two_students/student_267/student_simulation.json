  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students, one on each side of the paper. I remember that they should be separated to show how the string telephone works over a distance. Next, I'll draw a cup in each student's hand, because the cups are part of the string telephone. Now, I'll connect the two cups with a straight line to represent the string. I know the sound travels along this string. I should try to show they’re talking to each other through the cups! I'll add some lines to suggest sound coming from one cup. I remember the task said to label the parts, so I'll write 'cup' near each cup and 'string' next to the line. I’m not sure about which way the sound travels, but it seems that sound moves back and forth, so I might skip specific arrows. Hopefully, the cups, string, and the distance between the students show it's for communication.",
  "Prompt": "A colored pencil drawing of two students standing apart, each holding a cup connected by a straight line representing a string. The students appear to be communicating through the cups. The drawing shows the string telephone with simple details: the cups labeled 'cup' and the string labeled 'string'. The students are smiling, suggesting they are talking. There are lines near one of the cups to represent sound. The background is simple, emphasizing the students and string telephone setup.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including the key components of a string telephone: students, cups, and string, all clearly shown and partly labeled. The effort to show communication is there. The prompt avoids arrows for sound travel and accepts some inaccuracy or simplifications in labeling, aligning with what the student cannot do."
