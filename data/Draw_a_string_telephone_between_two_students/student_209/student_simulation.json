  "Reasoning": "I remember I have to draw a string telephone between two students. First, I'll draw two stick-person figures because I know they need to hold something like cups. I'll make sure they each have a round object in one hand; I think it looks like a cup. Next, I'll draw a line between the cups so it looks like there's something connecting them. I think that's what I'm supposed to do, but I'm not sure why there's a line there or what it's for. I'm not sure how to show who is talking or listening, so I'll just make them look happy. I'll draw them far apart, but I don't know how to show they're talking to each other. I don't remember if I should label anything, so Iâ€™ll just leave it without words.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of two stick-figure students standing in a simple, outdoor setting. Each student holds a cup-shaped object in one hand. A straight line connects the two cups, representing a string. One student on the left, one on the right, both with smiles. The scene is colorful but lacks specific details or labels, resembling a drawing done by a younger child with crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image matches what the student can and cannot do because it includes two students with cup-like objects and a connecting line, which shows they can draw the basic setup of a string telephone. However, it does not include any understanding of sound travel, communication, or labels, which the student struggles with. The lack of clarity about communication direction or purpose, plus the whimsical style, reflects their misunderstandings."
