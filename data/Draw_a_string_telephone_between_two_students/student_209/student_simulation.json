  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two stick figures to represent the students. I remember they need to be holding something like cups, so I'll add a couple of circles in their hands. I'm going to draw a straight line from one cup to the other, because I think this is how a string telephone looks. I’m not sure how sound travels through it, so I won’t add anything else to show that. I'll skip labeling because I'm not sure what to call these parts or how they're supposed to work. Maybe lines that show they are speaking? But it might just be 'magic words' that travel somehow.",
  "Prompt": "A simple pencil drawing showing two stick figure children, each holding a circle in one hand to represent cups. They are connected by a straight line symbolizing the string stretched tightly between them. The background is plain to focus on the figures and 'string'. The paper is unlined, and the drawing is in black and white, with no additional details or labels to show sound travel.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by depicting two people and an attempt at showing connection with the string. It doesn't include any labeling or additional elements to explain sound traveling through the string, reflecting the student's misunderstanding of how string telephones work."
