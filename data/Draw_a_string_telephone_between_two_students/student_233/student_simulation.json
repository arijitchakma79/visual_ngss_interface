  "Reasoning": "I'll try to picture how a string telephone works from what I've seen or heard before. I know it involves two people and some sort of string between them. I'll start by drawing two stick figure people on either side of the paper. I remember that there's a string involved, so I'll connect them with a wavy line that represents a string. I'm not sure if the string needs to be tight or not, so I'll just make it a bit loose. I think I recall something like cups or cans being part of it, but I'm not entirely sure how they fit in, or why they are important. So, I'll draw something that looks like they could be holding up to their mouths or ears, maybe a simple circle, representing those cups. I won't include much else because I'm not certain on the specifics like keeping the string taut, or if it can really send sound across a distance. It's kind of like a toy to me, I guess.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing showing two stick figure children facing each other. Each has an arm out holding a small circle at their mouths or ears, representing cups. Between them is a wavy line that represents the string. The line is not taut and is curved. The background is plain white with no additional details or elements. The drawing is in a child-like, rough pencil sketch style with minimal details, using basic colors for the figures, like blue and red for clothing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can and cannot do. The student can attempt to draw stick figures and a connecting element implying the string, but lacks understanding of the need for a taut string or the communication function of the device. The drawing's simplicity and lack of detail on the functional aspects, such as tautness or clear depiction of cups, matches the student's minimal understanding of the topic as described in the task outline."
