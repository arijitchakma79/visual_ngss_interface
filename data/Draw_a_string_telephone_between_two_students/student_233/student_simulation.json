  "Reasoning": "Alright, I'm going to draw a picture of how a string telephone works. First, I'll start by drawing two stick figures, one on each side of my page. These are the two people who are using the string telephone. Now, each person needs to be holding something. I think I'll draw small cups for them to hold, one in each of their hands. They might look a bit like cans because I'm not sure how to show a cup perfectly. Next, I'll connect these cups using a line that looks like a string, but it might not be completely straight. I know the string should be kind of tight, but that's a bit hard for me to show, so it might look a little loose. I remember something about sound traveling through the string, but I'm not sure how to show that. I’ll just focus on the string and people for now. Oh, I want to make it colorful, so I'll color the cups blue and the string red. I think that’s enough detail for now.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing in a child-like style showing two stick figures, each holding a small object resembling a cup or can in blue color. A wavy red line connects these objects, intended to represent a string, but it is not completely taut. The background is plain, and there are no labels or sound waves depicted. The color scheme is primarily blue for the cups and red for the string, with black or pencil lines for the stick figures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's efforts and understanding at a developing level. The student can draw two people with objects resembling cups and connect them with a line for the string, albeit sometimes not tight. However, the student struggles to depict sound traveling through the string and may not label parts or explain the function, which is absent in the prompt. The use of color and the simple style reflect the student's emerging understanding and attempts to show basic elements."
