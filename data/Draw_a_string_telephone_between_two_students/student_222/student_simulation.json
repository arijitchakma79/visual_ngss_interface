  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two students. First, I’ll draw one student on the left side of the paper. I’ll make a stick figure because that's easy for me. I’ll give the student a circle for a head and stick arms. Next, I’ll draw another student on the right side of the paper, also as a stick figure. Okay, now I need to show that they're connected somehow. I’ll draw a straight line between their hands. This line is a string. I’ve heard about string telephones, but I’m not really sure how they work. I’ll just draw the string between them like a line. They look like they're facing each other, so maybe they're talking. I won’t add anything else like waves or sound. I’m not sure how to show that in a drawing. I also think I’ll skip any labels or explanations since I'm not really sure how to describe what happens with the sound or the string.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing of two stick figure students on a white background. One student is on the left and the other on the right, each holding one end of a straight black line that connects their hands, representing a string. The drawing is in a colorful but basic style, with the students' heads being simple circles and their bodies simple lines. No additional details like sound waves or labels are present.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two students connected by a string, showing a minimal understanding of the concept of a string telephone. It omits details, like sound waves or explanations, to match the student's difficulty with understanding and portraying auditory communication. The lack of labels or captions reflects the student's misunderstanding of the device's function."
