  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students. I think they should face each other because they’re talking with the string telephone. I'll make one kid hold a cup by their mouth and the other holding a cup by their ear. I remember the string is supposed to connect the cups, so I’ll draw a line from the bottom of one cup to the bottom of the other. I know sound goes through the string somehow, so I’ll write ‘sound goes through string.’ I’ll put arrows around the string to show something happening, but I don’t know exactly how it works. I’ll write ‘talk here’ near the mouth of the student talking into the cup. I’ll use simple labeling without much explanation. I’ll draw the cups in gray because I think that's the color of metal, even if I’m not sure if they have to be metal. I should have the students stand on a grass field to make it look like they’re outside.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, child-like drawing showing two students facing each other on a grassy field. One student holds a gray cup to their mouth, labeled 'talk here,' and the other holds a gray cup to their ear. A line, labeled 'sound goes through string,' connects the two cups, with arrows near the string to suggest movement. The students appear cartoonish, and the drawing has basic labels and a simple style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's ability to draw two students and show them connected by a string telephone, including simple labels like 'sound goes through string' and 'talk here.' The student incorrectly assumes the cups are gray like metal, showing their incomplete understanding of materials. The student's drawing omits exact details on sound transmission, reflecting the lack of arrows indicating direction and misunderstanding of materials needed."
