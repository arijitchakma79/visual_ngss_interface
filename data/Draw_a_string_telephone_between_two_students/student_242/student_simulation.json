  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people because the task is about a phone between students. I remember that the old-fashioned string telephone uses cups and a string. So, I’ll draw two kids standing a bit apart. One kid on the left has a cup up to their ear, and the other on the right is talking into a cup. I know the string connects the cups, so I'll draw a line between the two cups. I probably don’t need to worry about the string being tight; just showing the string is good enough. I think I should label the string and cups. I'll write 'string' next to the line and 'cup' near each cup, but I'm not sure if this shows how it works. I know sound travels, so I'll add something like a wavy line near the talking cup, showing the sound, even if I'm not sure if it's the right direction or how it should look. But I’m not sure about explaining things like tension in the string or how this helps people talk to each other over distances. To me, it seems a bit like a fun game.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene of two cartoonish children using a string telephone. One child is on the left holding a red cup to their ear, and the other child is on the right speaking into a blue cup. Connect the cups with a straight black line representing the string. Label the line 'string' and each cup 'cup' with simple text. Indicate sound coming from the speaking child's cup with wavy lines in blue. Use bright, solid colors and a child-like drawing style with thick outlines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by depicting the basic elements: two children, cups, and a connecting string. The labels 'string' and 'cup' are included, but the lack of detail in sound direction and string tension reflects the student's struggles. The effort is shown by the attempt to indicate sound, but the omission of tension and unclear depiction of sound's role aligns with the student’s misunderstandings."
