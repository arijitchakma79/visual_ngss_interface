  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using cups and a string to illustrate a basic setup of a string telephone, but the setup may lack details like tension in the string.",
    "The student can label the string and cups, but labels might be incomplete or not clearly connected to how the device works.",
    "The student can indicate that sound travels through the string, but without showing direction or clarity on how it influences communication."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately depict how sound travels through the string with correct directionality or representation (e.g., absence of arrows or waves to show sound direction).",
    "The student misunderstands the use of tension in the string to effectively transmit sound, possibly drawing a slack or broken string (student doesnâ€™t realize tension is needed).",
    "The student might not clearly demonstrate the purpose of the device as solving the problem of long-distance communication without technology (student assumes it's just a toy, not for practical use).",
    "The student may not illustrate how the device connects people or affects human communication beyond its basic function (focuses on device, not human connection)."
