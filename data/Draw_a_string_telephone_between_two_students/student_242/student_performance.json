  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students using cups connected by a string to suggest a basic understanding of a string telephone.",
    "The student can depict sound lines coming from one cup, indicating an attempt to show communication.",
    "The student can label the cups and string, though labels might be sparse or lack detail."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately represent the string being taut, which is necessary for sound transmission (student thinks a loose string works the same).",
    "The student might not depict or misunderstand the need for the cups to function as a device that transmits sound (cups drawn randomly or not connected to students' mouths or ears).",
    "The student may not clearly convey how the device resolves the problem of communication over distances (string might be too short or cups too close, not illustrating distance).",
    "The drawing may not focus on demonstrating the use of sound exclusively (student might add unrelated elements like light or electricity)."
