  "Reasoning": "I remember the task is to draw a string telephone, which is supposed to let two people talk to each other. So, I'll start by drawing two kids, one on each side of my paper. I'll make one a girl with brown hair and a pink shirt, and the other a boy with short black hair and a blue shirt. I think they should be holding cups, so I'll draw a cup in each of their hands. I'll connect these cups with a piece of string. I know the string is important to making the telephone work, but I'm not sure how sound travels through it. I'll just show the string going straight across the paper between the cups because I remember that's how the telephone is supposed to look. I think the cups are usually white or paper-colored, so that's how I'll color them. I remember learning something about sound traveling, but I don't quite understand the details about vibrations and all. So I'll focus more on just showing the materials: two cups and a string. I can't really think about how it would work over a long distance, or how the string helps solve a communication problem, so I won't draw anything related to that.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two children standing apart, each holding a paper cup connected by a straight piece of string. The girl has brown hair and wears a pink shirt, while the boy has short black hair and a blue shirt. Their paper cups are white. The background is a simple, grassy field with a blue sky. This drawing style is bright, colorful, and basic, showing a simple understanding of a string telephone.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it includes the depiction of two students (can do), holding cups connected by a string, showing a basic understanding of a string telephone. It does not include any details about how sound vibrations work, long-distance communication, or the purpose of communication, which aligns with what the student cannot do."
