  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two stick figure students standing apart from each other. They should look like they're communicating. I'll draw one student holding a cup to their mouth, as if they're speaking into it, and the other student holding a cup to their ear, like they're listening. I remember that the cups should be connected by a string, so I’ll draw a straight line from the first cup to the second one, showing the string connecting them. I can add arrows along the string to show the direction of the sound traveling from the speaker to the listener; this will make it clear that sound is moving through the string. I’ll make the arrows point from the speaker towards the listener. I might struggle a bit to show exactly how sound travels through the string, but with the arrows, it should help. I won’t focus too much on labeling how this setup lets the students communicate over a distance, but the drawing itself will show that they’re farther apart and using the string telephone.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing featuring two stick figure students standing several feet apart. One student holds a red plastic cup to their mouth, and the other holds a blue cup to their ear, connected by a taut, thin black string. Along the string, several black arrows point from the speaking student towards the listening student, indicating sound travel. The scene is colorful with green grass beneath and a bright blue sky above. The style is simplistic and cartoonish, typical of a young student’s science project.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to clearly depict the basic function of the string telephone, showing both cups and the connecting string, aligned with their proficiency in demonstrating sound communication with the device. The addition of arrows on the string signifies their understanding of sound movement, albeit potentially incomplete. The missing elements, such as detailed explanations or labels about long-distance effectiveness, depict the student's struggle with fully articulating why this method is helpful over distances, reflecting their level of proficiency."
