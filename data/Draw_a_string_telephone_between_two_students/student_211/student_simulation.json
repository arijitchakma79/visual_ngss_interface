  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two students facing each other because that's how the string telephone works. I'll draw one student on the left and the other on the right. Next, I'll add a cup in each of their hands: one student will hold the cup to their mouth as if they're speaking, and the other will have the cup to their ear as if they're listening. I know the string needs to go between the two cups, so I'll draw a line connecting them, making the string taut. I should label the cups and the string to show what they are. I'll also label where the sound waves are, though I'm not exactly sure how to draw the sound traveling through the string. I'll draw some squiggly lines or arrows near the speaker's mouth to show sound is happening. Hopefully, that shows sound transmission, even if I don't fully understand how the material properties contribute. I think I've got most of it right.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of two children facing each other, each holding a cup, with a string connecting their cups. The child on the left holds the cup to their mouth; the child on the right holds the cup to their ear. The string between the cups is drawn taut. The image includes labels for 'cup,' 'string,' and uses wavy lines or arrows near the speaking child's mouth to indicate 'sound waves.' The style is a colorful, simple sketch with clear labeling, reflecting a basic but mostly correct understanding of a string telephone.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt includes the essential elements the student can represent: two students, cups, a taut string, and labels for the components. The student demonstrates understanding by showing the connection, the speaking and receiving aspects, and labeling key parts. However, they struggled with accurately depicting how sound travels through the string and why specific materials are used, so the drawing includes simple sound wave representations that hint at sound transmission without fully capturing it."
