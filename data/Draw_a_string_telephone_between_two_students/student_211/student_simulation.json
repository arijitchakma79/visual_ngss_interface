  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two people because I know there are two students who are supposed to talk to each other. I'll make them stand facing each other. I think the string has something to do with them talking, so I'll try to draw a line between them, but I'm not sure what else to do with it. I might make the line wavy because it looks interesting. I remember something about cups or cans, but I'm not sure how they fit into this, so I won't include them. I don't know how the sound travels, so I won't add any notes or labels about it.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of two stick figure students facing each other. There is a wavy line between them that does not connect to any objects. The background is simple with no specific details about the setting. The drawing style is basic and childlike, with minimal details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw two students, showing an attempt to create communication partners. The wavy line represents a potential effort to depict the string, though it remains abstract and unconnected to any specific devices. The absence of cups or cans, as well as the lack of labels or notes, indicates the student's misunderstanding of constructing and labeling a string telephone."
