  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two distinct people or figures at a considerable distance from each other, suggesting they are trying to communicate over that space.",
    "The student can illustrate a string telephone with cups or cans connected by a string between the two figures, showing an understanding of how sound can travel through the setup.",
    "The student can show the string taut between the cans or cups, suggesting they understand tension in the line is necessary for sound transmission.",
    "The student can include labels such as 'sound travels here' alongside the string, indicating a moderate understanding of the communication process."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label or explain how sound specifically travels from one person to the other beyond just indicating 'sound travels here' (lacks detailed explanation of sound waves or vibrations).",
    "The student might not demonstrate complete understanding by omitting small but relevant features, such as labeling which part of the setup receives sound (e.g., no label on the receiving cup can) or mislabeling parts (e.g., mistakenly suggesting that both ends are talking simultaneously)."
