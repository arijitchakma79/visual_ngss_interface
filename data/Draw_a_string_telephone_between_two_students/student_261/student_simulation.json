  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two stick figures to represent the students. They need something to hold, like a cup, so I’ll draw an oval shape in each one's hand, but I'm not sure it actually looks like a cup. Now, I need to connect them with a string, so I'll draw a wavy line between the two figures. The line is supposed to be the string, but I don't really know how tight it should be, and I'm not really sure where it attaches to the cup-like shapes. I know sound has something to do with this, but I can't remember how it travels. I won't try labeling the parts because I don’t know what exactly to call them. Okay, at least there is a line between them, hopefully that looks like a connection.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing in crayon style, featuring two stick figure students. Each holds an oval shape that might be interpreted as a cup. A wavy, inconsistent line connects the two figures, suggesting a string. The background is simple with no additional details. The figures and objects are colorful, with red, blue, and green primarily used.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects a beginner level understanding as the drawing includes two students, a wavy line suggesting an attempt at connection, and holds oval shapes that might be interpreted as cups. It lacks detail in how sound would travel or how the device works, consistent with the limitations described in the 'CANNOT' section. The drawing attempts to show a basic connection but lacks the accuracy and understanding of functionality."
