  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two students standing apart, as they need to communicate over a long distance. I remember that the string telephone uses cups and string, so I'll draw a cup in each student's hand. Now, I'll draw the string connecting the two cups, but I might accidentally draw it a bit saggy because I often forget it needs to be tight. I'll label the cups and string to show their role in communicating sound. I want to show how sound travels, so I’ll attempt to draw sound waves, but I might miss out on little elements like arrows indicating the direction of sound. I’ll use bright colors for the students’ clothes and cups to make the drawing lively, maybe use some green and blue for the background to show the environment.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two students standing apart, each holding a cup to their ear or mouth, connected by a string to show a string telephone. Use bright colors for the students' clothing such as red and yellow, and vibrant colors for the cups like blue and green. The string should interconnect the cups but may be depicted with a bit of sag. Draw sound waves in an abstract manner to indicate communication, set against a simple outdoor background with green grass and a blue sky. Use a child-friendly drawing style, with clear labels for the cups and string.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency in drawing key components like the students, cups, and string, while vibrant colors reflect effort. However, it also includes common issues like a sagging string and the abstract depiction of sound travel without precise direction, aligning with the student's struggles."
