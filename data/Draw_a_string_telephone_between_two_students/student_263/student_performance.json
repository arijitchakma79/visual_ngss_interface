  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate a situation where two students need to communicate from a distance (likely show a scenario like a park or different locations).",
    "Design and draw a string telephone using materials like cups and string, showing how it functions to solve the communication problem.",
    "Include labels for most materials, like 'string' and 'cup'.",
    "Depict a reasonable distance between the students and label this distance (e.g., '10 feet').",
    "Explain through the drawing how sound travels along the string using directional arrows or similar indicators.",
    "Convey the importance of using a string telephone to improve communication (e.g., showing students smiling or engaged)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "May inconsistently label all materials (e.g., label the string but not one of the cups).",
    "Might not provide a detailed depiction of how the sound travels through the string over a distance (e.g., missing arrows or annotations).",
    "Could fail to explain explicitly how the string telephone improves communication, relying on visual cues instead of text (e.g., no text explaining the improvement).",
    "Might depict a slightly unrealistic scenario for the string's use by showing too short or too long a distance, or unclear context of difficulty solved."
