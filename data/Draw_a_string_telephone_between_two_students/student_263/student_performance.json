  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw two students clearly separated by a distance and connected by a string telephone.",
    "The student can illustrate the string telephone as a device that uses sound, depicting the cups or cans at the ends.",
    "The student can show sound waves traveling along the string using simple illustrations like wavy lines or arrows.",
    "The student can depict the scenario as a solution to communicating over the distance, generally showing students interacting with the device.",
    "The student can label the components, such as 'string' and 'cans', and indicate it as a technological communication tool."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label the direction of sound waves or provide incomplete labeling (student labels only one end of the string).",
    "The student might not fully depict how sound waves are received at the other end (student may forget to show the waves reaching the second student).",
    "The student may not visually convey the problem being solved (may not clearly show the distance as an issue solved by the string telephone).",
    "The student may overlook labeling it explicitly as 'technology' (may assume itâ€™s understood without clear labels)."
