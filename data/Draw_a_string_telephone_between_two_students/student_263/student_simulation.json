  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students with some distance between them. I remember that a string telephone uses cups or cans, so I'll draw a cup next to each student. I’ll connect the cups with a straight line to represent the string. To show sound waves traveling through the string, I'll try to add wavy lines or arrows starting from one cup and going along the string, but I'm not completely sure I’ll label which direction they’re going. Let me label the cups as 'cans' and the line between them as 'string' so it’s clear what each part is. I'm supposed to show that this helps with communication over a distance, so I'll attempt to position the students so they look like they’re interacting with the device, like smiling or holding a cup to their ear. I should remember to label this setup as technology. However, I might forget to do that, assuming it's understood already.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a string telephone with two students. Each student holds a cup, depicted as tin cans, connected by a straight string. The students are separated by a moderate distance. Small wavy lines or arrows are shown traveling along the string to represent sound waves, though the arrows may not be consistently or fully labeled to show direction. Each component like 'string' and 'cans' is labeled. The students appear to interact with the telephone, with one holding a can up to their ear. Background is minimal. Drawing style is childlike and colorful, using bright primary colors, with elements like labels and sound waves lightly sketched.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student’s abilities because it includes the key components such as the students, cans, string, and sound waves in a clear and childlike manner. The prompt describes labels for parts of the string telephone, which the student can do. However, there may be incomplete or inconsistent labeling of sound wave directions and the technological aspect, aligning with what the student struggles with. The drawing style reflects a Level 3 proficiency, showing most elements clearly but with room for improvement."
