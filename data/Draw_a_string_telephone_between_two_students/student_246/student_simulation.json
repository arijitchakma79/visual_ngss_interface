  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a string telephone between two students. I’ll start by drawing two stick-figure kids, each holding a cup. One can hold the cup to their mouth like they're talking, and the other can have it by their ear like they're listening. I'll draw a line between the two cups to represent the string. I know the string is supposed to help sound travel, so I should add some lines or arrows on the string to show sound moving along it. That seems right. Oh no, I almost forgot to connect the line fully; it won’t work if the string isn't complete. I think that's how the sound goes. But I’m not sure how sound really travels along it, like the vibrations or anything complicated. I’ll just put the line and make sure both kids look like they're communicating. I might use colors so it's less boring—red for the string and blue for the kids’ clothes. I hope the cups look like they're made of paper, not some solid stuff. I think that's close to what I’m supposed to show.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two stick-figure students communicating through a string telephone. One student is speaking into a cup, and the other is listening. A red line connects the two cups to represent the string. There are lines or arrows on the string to suggest sound traveling. The students are wearing blue clothes. The drawing should be simple and colorful, reflects an emerging understanding of a string telephone.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to draw two students with cups connected by a string, denote sound traveling along the string simply, and depict active communication. It highlights a level 2 development with basic elements shown, such as students holding cups and a string between them. However, it does not delve into complex sound transmission mechanics, reflecting the student's struggle with accurately illustrating sound travel and using ordinary materials to show how the device works."
