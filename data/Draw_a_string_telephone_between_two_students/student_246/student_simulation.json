  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people. They need to look like they're trying to talk to each other, so I'll draw them facing each other and not too far apart. I'll give each person a cup to hold, and connect the cups with a string. I think I'll use a line to show the string from one cup to the other. I should label these parts so I'll write the word 'cup' next to each cup and 'string' on the line connecting them. I can imagine these parts in my head, but I’m not sure how to draw the string tight like they talked about in class. What if it just hangs down? That looks okay. I’ll try to make them look like they’re having a conversation through the cups.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two children attempting to communicate using a string telephone. The children are facing each other, each holding a paper cup to their ear. A loosely drawn line connects the cups, representing the string. The background is simple, with minimal details to focus on the children and the string telephone. Basic labels are added: 'cup' next to each cup and 'string' along the line. The drawing is in a naive, colored pencil style with vibrant colors for the children's clothing and light pastel colors for the cups.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw two people positioned a short distance apart, using simple materials like cups and a string to connect them. The student attempts to label the parts, but may not accurately show the string tension or provide detailed explanations on sound travel, reflecting their developing understanding."
