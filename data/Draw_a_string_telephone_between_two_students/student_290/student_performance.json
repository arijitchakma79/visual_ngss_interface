  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a basic string telephone connecting two students, showing an understanding that the string is a key component.",
    "The student can partially depict sound traveling through the string, possibly using lines or arrows indicating direction (though these may be inconsistently applied).",
    "The student can attempt to label parts of the device such as 'cup' or 'string'.",
    "The student may show one or two features that hint at the technology aspect of communication over distance, such as the separation between the students."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to show a clear and correct depiction of sound waves traveling through the string (may not include sound representation at all, or may illustrate it incorrectly).",
    "The student cannot effectively demonstrate that the device relies on sound, not just the string, for communication (may think the string alone is sufficient without need for sound).",
    "The student may misunderstand labeling by incorrectly naming parts or omitting essential components that facilitate sound travel (e.g., not labeling 'sound' or 'vibrations').",
    "The student is unlikely to include detailed features that emphasize the importance of the technology in communicating over distances beyond a basic connection (e.g., no focus on real-life application or the technology aspect as a solution)."
