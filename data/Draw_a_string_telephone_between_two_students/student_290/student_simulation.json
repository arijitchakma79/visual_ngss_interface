  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students, one on each side of the paper. They need to be facing each other. I remember from the classroom that they hold a cup up to their ear or mouth, so I'll draw a cup in each student's hand. I'll connect them with a straight line to represent the string. The string is important, so I need to make it clear. Next, I’ll try to show that sound travels through the string. I think lines or arrows might help, so I’ll draw some lines around the string. I'll label the cups and string, but I'm not sure if I should label sound or vibrations. Maybe I should write 'sound' somewhere around the string. The students should be apart, because I remember the string phone lets you talk from far away. But I’m not sure if I need more details to highlight how the sound works through the string.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple illustration of two students holding a string telephone made of cups and string. Student 1 is on the left, holding a cup to their mouth, and Student 2 is on the right, holding a cup to their ear. Between them is a straight line representing the string. The image should include dashed or zig-zag lines around the string to attempt to show sound traveling. Label the cups and the string. Use basic colors: the cups are red, the string is black, and the students wear colorful clothes. This should be a hand-drawn, school project style in a simple, cartoonish art style.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing illustrates a string telephone with a focus on the basic components: two students, cups, and string. The lines around the string represent the student's attempt to show sound travel, though it might not be clear or correct. The student struggles with effectively depicting sound, only partially labels, and lacks detailed features highlighting the communication technology, which aligns with the 'cannot do' aspects of the task. The color and drawing style are simple and suitable for the student's developing level."
