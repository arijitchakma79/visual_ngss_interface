  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two stick-figure people, one on the left and one on the right. Each person should have a cup in one hand, so I'll draw a shape that looks like a cup near their hands. The cups will be open towards the person, like they are listening or speaking into it. I know there should be a string connecting the cups, so I'll draw a line between them, but it might not look perfectly straight. I'll make it kind of wavy because I'm not sure how tight it should be. I should show that the string is how the sound travels, but I'm not exactly sure how to show that, so Iâ€™ll skip drawing sound waves. Oh, I think I'm supposed to label things too. I'll try to label 'cup' near one of the cups, but I might forget to do the same for the other parts. Finally, maybe I should write a little note to explain the picture, but I'm not confident about what to say, so I'll just leave it as it is.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image of two stick-figure children, each holding a cup at the end of a slightly wavy line representing a string. The children are positioned on opposite sides of the image. The cups are simple cylindrical shapes near their hands, and the line connects the two cups but isn't fully straight or taut. The image lacks sound waves or directional arrows. One cup is labeled 'cup', and the drawing is colored with simple colors such as blue for the cups, a brown for the string, and basic colors for the children. The style is simple and child-like.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's ability to draw a basic representation of a string telephone using two cups and a string connecting them. The wavy line illustrates how the student might not understand the need for it to be taut. The missing sound waves or directional arrows highlight the student's misunderstanding of how sound travels through the string. The inconsistent labeling reflects the student's struggle to apply labels accurately or fully. This drawing task aligns with their developing understanding of the topic."
