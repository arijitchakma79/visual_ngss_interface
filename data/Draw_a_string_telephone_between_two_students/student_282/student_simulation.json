  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two students standing a good distance apart. I remember that for a string telephone to work, the string has to be pulled tight, so I'll make sure to show the string really straight between them. I'll draw each student holding a cup to their ear or mouth. One student should be speaking, and the other one listening, so it’s clear they are communicating. I need to draw the string connecting the bottom of the cups, and label them. I should add some wavy lines around the string to show sound traveling between them. I’ll try to make the string look taut, maybe add a label saying 'taut' or 'under tension' next to it. Oh, I can't forget to label the parts: 'cup', 'string', 'student speaking', 'student listening'. I might forget to explain all the physics, but showing sound waves should be good enough for now. I'll draw this in a colorful, cartoon style so it’s easy to understand.",
  "Prompt": "Create a colorful, cartoon-style drawing of two students using a string telephone. One student is speaking into a paper cup, while the other is listening. A taut string connects the cups, with wavy lines drawn around the string to indicate sound traveling. The distance between the students should be visibly longer than shouting distance. Label the cups as 'cup', the string as 'string (taut)', and add labels for 'student speaking' and 'student listening'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by describing a detailed and accurate representation of a string telephone, emphasizing tension in the string and the roles of each student. It uses labels effectively to enhance understanding. The prompt captures the struggle with not detailing every physical principle by focusing on visual cues like sound waves without deep explanations. It ensures completeness of the primary concept while acknowledging possible omissions in labeling and explanation of physical principles."
