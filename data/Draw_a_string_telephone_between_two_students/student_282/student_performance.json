  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can create a detailed and accurate drawing that shows two students using a string telephone to communicate, complete with clear roles for each student.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate the string connecting the two devices between the students, showing the tension and directionality required for effective sound transmission.",
    "The student can include a concise and clear explanation in the drawing of how the string transmits sound, possibly including sound waves or other indicators of sound movement along the string.",
    "The student can label parts of the drawing effectively to show how the design uses sound to communicate information, such as labeling the cups/cans and string.",
    "The student can demonstrate through the drawing how the device solves the problem of communicating over a distance, such as showing a distance that would otherwise make shouting ineffective."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have minor omissions in labeling, such as forgetting to label the string as 'taut' or 'under tension,' which enhances sound transmission.",
    "The student might not detail every physical principle involved, such as how sound needs a medium to travel, though the primary concept is correctly communicated."
