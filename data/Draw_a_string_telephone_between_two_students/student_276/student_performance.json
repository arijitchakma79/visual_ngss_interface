  "Topic": "Draw a string telephone between two students.",
  "Code": "1-PS4-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced - complete and accurate representation of all elements.",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw two people using a device to communicate over a distance, showing a clear depiction of a string connecting between two cups held by each student.",
    "The student can illustrate how the device uses sound to send or receive messages, possibly by drawing sound waves or arrows indicating the direction of sound travel.",
    "The student can use labels to describe parts of the device such as 'cup', 'string', and 'sound', and explain how they contribute to communication.",
    "The student can include details showing that technology, like the string telephone, is essential for communication over distances, perhaps illustrated by the happy expressions of the communicating students or scenes indicating previous attempts to communicate without success.",
    "The student can effectively depict how the device solves the problem of distance communication by illustrating a scenario where students are too far apart to hear each other without the device."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "May have minor gaps in labeling consistency (e.g., occasionally forgetting to label one part).",
    "Might slightly misrepresent the realism of sound waves visually, but the concept is still clearly conveyed (e.g., overly simplified waves)."
