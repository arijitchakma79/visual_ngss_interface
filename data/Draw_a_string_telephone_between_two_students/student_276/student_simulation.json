  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two people, one on the left and one on the right. They should be facing each other and holding cups to their mouths and ears. I'll draw a string connecting the cups, so it looks like a real string telephone. I remember that the cups need to be labeled as 'cup' and the string as 'string'. I should also show sound waves or arrows from one cup to the other to illustrate communication. I'll use arrows between the cups to represent sound travel, but it might look a bit simple since drawing realistic sound waves is tricky. To show they're communicating happily, I'll make sure each student has a smile. I’ll also draw a small scene around them, maybe a tree or a park bench, and place the students a little far apart to show a use case where the string telephone is necessary. I might forget to label one cup, but the main elements will be clear.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two students, one on the left and one on the right of the image, facing each other and holding a string telephone made of cups and string. The left student holds a cup to their ear, while the right student speaks into their cup. Draw a string stretching between the cups. Label one cup as 'cup' and the string as 'string'. Show arrows between the cups to indicate sound travel. Each student should have a happy expression. Include simple background elements like a tree or bench to indicate the setting is outdoors. Use colorful markers and crayons to add a playful, child-like touch. Make sure one cup is missing a label for authenticity, and the sound waves are overly simplified.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the student’s abilities to draw a complete and accurate representation of the string telephone except for minor labeling omissions and simplified sound waves. The happy expressions and outdoor setting show how the device enables communication, addressing the problem of distance. The child-like, colorful style reflects the advanced level yet acknowledges the student's capability to illustrate most, but not all, details."
