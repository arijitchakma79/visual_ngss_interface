  "Reasoning": "First, I'll choose two habitats to draw: a forest for the land habitat and an ocean for the water habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll start by drawing tall trees of different kinds like pines and oaks. In the forest, I'll add some bushes and grasses on the ground. I remember forests also have animals, so I'll draw a bird in the tree, a squirrel looking for nuts, and maybe a deer grazing. For small creatures, I'll include an ant on the ground and a lizard basking on a rock. Now, for the ocean, I'll use blue to show water. I'll draw fish swimming in different directions, and maybe a starfish near the bottom. I remember oceans have seaweed, so I'll add some long strands of that. For bigger creatures, I'll draw a dolphin jumping out of the water and a crab on the sandy sea floor. I'll try to label everything clearly. I understand forests and oceans have different living things, but I know some similarities like both having animals and plants. I must not forget to show that the ocean habitat is underwater while the forest is on land.",
  "Prompt": "An advanced-level student's drawing showing a forest and an ocean habitat side by side. On the left, a forest with tall, green trees, such as pines and oaks, and scattered bushes and grasses. Include a bird perched in the tree, a squirrel on a branch, a deer grazing, with ants on the ground and a lizard on a rock. On the right, an ocean with clear blue water and swimming fish. Show a dolphin leaping above the water, a starfish on the sea bottom, and seaweed swaying underwater. Include a crab on a sandy patch. Label each living thing clearly. Use a realistic and colorful style to depict diversity and differences between a land and a water habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately depict a forest and an ocean, with diverse living things present in each habitat, such as trees, animals, fish, and aquatic plants. The student can visually compare the differences and similarities in diversity across habitats, as seen in the prompt's inclusion of common characteristics and environmental differences. The drawing shows the student's advanced understanding by labeling and organizing the depicted elements clearly. The mention of minor labeling gaps aligns with the student's level, ensuring any minimal omission does not detract from the overall understanding shown."
