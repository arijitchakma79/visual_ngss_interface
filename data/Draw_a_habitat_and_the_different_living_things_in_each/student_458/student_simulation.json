  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a garden because I know some things about gardens from what we learned in class. I remember gardens usually have some trees and maybe a bush, so I’ll put a couple of those in. I think I'll add a pond next to the garden because I know about ponds too. In the garden, I’ll draw some insects, like ants, since they belong there. I think I should also add a bird, sitting on one of the bushes. For the pond, I'll include a fish because fish live in water. But I’m not sure what else belongs in a pond, so I’ll just leave it with the fish. I’m a bit confused about how to make the garden and pond look very different, and I worry they might end up looking like the same place. I wish I knew more types of animals or plants I could add, but I can’t think of any. I’ll try to make sure each area has at least one plant or animal, even if they’re kind of similar.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a simple garden and pond side by side. The garden has a couple of generic trees and a bush with a small black ant crawling. Above the bush, a simple round bird with a beak is perched. The pond is drawn with blue crayon, containing a single fish with simple features like a fin and eye. The drawing is colorful but lacks detail, and both the garden and pond sections look similar in terms of plant and animal diversity. The style is basic and child-like, indicative of an emerging understanding of the topic.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt specifies a garden and pond, with basic plants and animals like trees, bushes, and ants in the garden, and a fish in the pond. This matches the student's abilities listed under 'CAN' because they can draw these basic elements and some animals fitting those habitats. However, the drawing lacks diversity and fails to clearly distinguish between the habitats, reflecting the 'CANNOT' aspects, such as confusing habitat characteristics and limited range of biodiversity represented."
