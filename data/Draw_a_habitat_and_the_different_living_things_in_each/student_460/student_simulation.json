  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a forest habitat because I know a lot about it. I remember seeing different kinds of trees in a forest, like oak and pine trees, so I'll make sure to include them. I'll draw the trees with tall trunks and sort of triangular tops for the pines, and round, full tops for the oaks. Next, I'll add some bushes and patches of grass on the forest floor. I know animals like squirrels, lizards, and birds live in forests too, so I'll add a squirrel climbing one of the trees and a lizard on a rock. I'll draw a bird flying above. I remember that ants make their homes on the ground, so I'll draw an ant hill as well. For my second habitat, I’ll draw a desert. I know deserts have cacti instead of trees and sandy ground. I'll draw a tall cactus with long arms, and some small, prickly bushes. I'll add a snake slithering on the sand and a hawk flying high in the sky. I’ll try to show how different the desert is from the forest by making sure the colors are really obvious — lots of green in the forest and browns and yellows in the desert. Now, I'll label everything carefully, making sure I spell everything right. I might have to fix some labels if I misspell them at first.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed drawing of a forest and a desert habitat side by side, with labels for each element. In the forest habitat, draw tall oak and pine trees with squirrels in the trees, a lizard on a rock, a bird flying above, and an anthill on the ground. Surround them with bushes and grass. In the desert habitat, draw a tall cactus with arms, some small prickly bushes, a snake on the sandy ground, and a hawk soaring overhead. Use vibrant greens and browns for the forest and browns and yellows for the desert. The style should be colorful and detailed, with clear labels for all plants and animals, reminiscent of a student's drawing in crayon or colored pencil.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately and vividly depict different habitats, including specific plants and animals, as outlined in the 'can do' abilities. The detailed labels and attention to showing differences between habitats highlight their advanced level. Minor struggles, like correcting misspelled labels, are subtle and do not detract from the task completion."
