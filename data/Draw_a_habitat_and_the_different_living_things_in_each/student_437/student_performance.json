  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may be able to draw a general shape or outline of a habitat (e.g., a body of water or land mass) but with minimal detail or accuracy.",
    "The student might include some basic depictions of living things, such as drawing a tree or a fish, but these may lack depth or accuracy in terms of type or variety."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately differentiate between types of habitats (e.g., mistakenly drawing a playground labeled as a pond, or vice versa).",
    "The student may not illustrate a variety of living things specific to each habitat type (e.g., drawing the same generic fish or tree in both a forest and a pond).",
    "There might be no visible distinction between land and water habitats due to unclear or inconsistent drawing (e.g., no water lines or habitat elements).",
    "The student is unlikely to show patterns or make comparisons between living things in different habitats (e.g., redundant usage of identical elements without noting differences).",
    "Labeling is likely absent or incorrect, with few or no labels for plants and animals, leading to confusion about what is represented (student may label a fish as a tree).",
    "Natural variation: There may be basic attempts to show elements like a sun or clouds across all habitats irrespective of their relevance, misunderstanding their role in specific habitats."
