  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently compare and show patterns of plant and animal diversity across different habitats (e.g., may overlook diversity in smaller organisms or fail to highlight a certain pattern).",
    "The student may have minor gaps in labeling or mislabel a few living things (e.g., labeling a bush as a tree due to size confusion or missing a label entirely).",
    "The student might struggle to accurately illustrate complex or unfamiliar living things in a detailed way, sometimes resorting to generic shapes (e.g., clams could be drawn too simplistically)."
