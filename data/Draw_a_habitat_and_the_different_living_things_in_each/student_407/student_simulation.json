  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a land habitat, like a garden. I know gardens have different plants and animals. I'll draw some trees with tall trunks and leafy tops. I also need to add some bushes and flowers. I'll draw a few squirrels and maybe a lizard or two on the ground because I've seen them in gardens before. I have to include ants too, crawling near the bushes. Now, for the water habitat, I'll think of a pond. I'll draw a pond with wavy lines to show water and some fish with simple shapes. I remember ponds have clams, but drawing them is tricky, so I’ll keep them basic. I'll add some grass-like plants around the pond's edge. Next, I’ll label everything. I’ll try to get the labels right, but sometimes I confuse bushes with small trees. I have to organize my drawing so that each habitat is clear and separate, with creatures that belong in each. I sometimes miss small details or diversity, especially in small organisms, but I'll do my best.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two separate habitats: a colorful garden and a blue-shaded pond. The garden has tall green trees, smaller green and red bushes, and yellow flowers. There are simple representations of squirrels, ants, and a couple of lizards on the ground. To the side, a serene pond with wavy lines for water includes basic shapes of fish and a couple of clams. Surrounding the pond's edge are green grasses. Each living thing is labeled, although some labels might be misplaced or missing, like bushes potentially mislabeled as trees. The style is typical of a student in a primary school, using bright crayons with clear yet basic features.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate and label various plants and animals in a garden and pond accurately but acknowledges potential minor labeling errors, particularly with similar-looking plants. Using primary school style with bright colors and simple shapes exhibits the student's proficiency level, while the clear separation of habitats represents the student's attempt to organize the drawing effectively. The presence of various living things shows the student's accurate inclusion, despite possible oversimplification of smaller organisms like clams."
