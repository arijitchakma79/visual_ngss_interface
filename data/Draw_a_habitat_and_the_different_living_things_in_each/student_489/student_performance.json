  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly draw specific habitats like pond or stream environments (student might not understand different habitat types).",
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate a variety of living things in each habitat (the student may misunderstand what types of living things belong in each habitat, like drawing a fish on land).",
    "The student might not be able to compare or show diversity of living things in the drawings (student might draw similar looking animals or fail to distinguish plant types).",
