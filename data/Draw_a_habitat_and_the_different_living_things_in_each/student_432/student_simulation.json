  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a forest. I remember that forests have lots of tall trees, like oak and pine, so I'll draw them with their typical triangular shapes and label them. Beneath the trees, I'll add some bushes and maybe a few flowering plants, like daisies, making sure to label them too. Let's see, animals in the forest... I'll draw a deer next to the trees and a squirrel on a branch. I'll add a lizard on the ground to show more diversity. Now, I'll draw a pond beside the forest. The pond should have water plants along the edge. I'll put a fish in the water and a frog on a lily pad. Maybe a duck swimming on the pond would look nice too. Next, I'll draw a garden on the other side. Gardens have lots of different plants, so I'll sketch some vegetable plants like tomatoes with red fruits, and a row of colorful flower beds. I'll add a rabbit among the flowers and maybe a butterfly above them. I'm trying to keep the scale right, but I hope I don't make anything too big like last time. Oh, I forgot to label that bush as a bush and not a tree – better fix that. Finally, I'll shade and color everything to show what’s unique in each habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed, colorful drawing of three habitats side by side: a forest with tall green trees, bushes, and flowering plants (daisies), showing animals like a deer, a squirrel, and a lizard; a pond with water plants, a fish, a frog on a lily pad, and a duck swimming; and a garden with tomato plants, rows of multicolored flowers, a rabbit, and a butterfly. Ensure the habitats are labeled correctly (oak and pine trees in the forest, tomato plants in the garden) and depict living things at a realistic scale, with vibrant colors, showing a clear contrast between the different environments. The drawing style is vibrant and detailed, suited for a proficient young student artist.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately represent multiple habitats with diverse plants and animals, highlighting their strengths. It includes distinct environments (forest, pond, garden) with appropriate flora and fauna, aligning well with what the student is capable of doing. It also accounts for minor potential errors, like mislabeling, by emphasizing clarity in labels and realistic proportions, matching their descriptive capabilities. The drawing style and detail reflect the student's advanced skill level."
