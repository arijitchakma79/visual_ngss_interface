  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I'll make sure to include tall trees with green leaves for the forest canopy and add brown trunks. Beneath the canopy, I'll add smaller plants like bushes and ferns to show the variety of plant life. For animals, I'll draw a deer and a few birds, like robins, perched on branches. I'll add a small clear stream with some fish swimming in it. I remember that having diverse plants and animals is important to show. Then, I'll draw a pond habitat next to the forest. I'll fill the pond with water and draw lily pads on the surface. Around the pond, I'll include cattails and reeds, which usually grow in such wet areas. For animals, I'll sketch frogs on the lily pads, ducks swimming, and dragonflies hovering above. Finally, I'll create a garden habitat. I'll draw rows of colorful flowers in reds, yellows, and purples, along with some butterflies and bees hovering above to show pollination. I'll add a few earthworms in the soil, because I know they're important for gardens. I'll compare these drawings by noting that while all have greenery, the types of plants and animals differ. Oops, I hope I didnâ€™t mix up labeling the reeds and cattails in the pond.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed illustration of three different habitats: a forest, a pond, and a garden. In the forest, include tall green trees with brown trunks, underbrush, and animals like deer, robins, and fish in a stream. In the pond, show water with lily pads, ducks, frogs, dragonflies, and surrounding reeds and cattails. For the garden, depict colorful flowers in rows, bees, butterflies, and earthworms in the soil. Use vibrant colors for clarity and a realistic drawing style suitable for an advanced elementary student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes all the elements the student can perform, such as depicting a variety of plants and animals in each distinct habitat, detailing habitat characteristics, and comparing differences and similarities across the habitats. It reflects the advanced level by including a diverse range of life forms and accurate details about environmental features. The potential mislabeling of reeds and cattails is a minor gap and does not significantly impact the overall understanding showcased in the drawing prompt."
