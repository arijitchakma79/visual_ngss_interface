  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a playground for my land habitat. I remember playgrounds usually have grass and trees, so I’ll draw green grass at the bottom and a couple of trees with brown trunks and green tops. Now, I’ll add some squirrels because they are common in playgrounds. I’ll draw a few small brown blobs with long bushy tails to represent them. Next, I’ll draw a garden as another land habitat. I think gardens have flowers and maybe some bushes, so I’ll add some colorful flowers with different colors like red, blue, and yellow and a couple of bushes. Now for a water habitat, I’ll draw a pond. I’ll use blue to make the water at the bottom part of my page, and I’ll add some fish in the pond as orange shapes. I think frogs might also be in ponds, so I’ll draw a couple of green frogs sitting on the edge of the pond. Even though I know clams belong in water, I sometimes get confused, so I won’t draw any in my garden. I understand that these plants and animals live in special places like this, but I’m not sure exactly why. I’ll just show them where I think they go. I'll try my best to make everything look clear, even if I miss some details.",
  "Prompt": "A children's drawing featuring a playground with grassy areas and trees. There are brown squirrels with bushy tails in the playground. Next to it, a garden is filled with red, blue, and yellow flowers and green bushes. Below, a pond with blue water contains orange fish and green frogs near the pond's edge. The style is colorful and resembles a child's playful, simplified art, focusing on basic shapes and vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw land and water habitats with some common plants and animals correctly represented, like trees, grass, flowers, and squirrels for land, and fish and frogs for water. It also reflects their level by showing basic organization and understanding, even if intricate details and roles are missing, aligning with what they can and cannot do."
