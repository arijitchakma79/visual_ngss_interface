  "Reasoning": "I'll draw a forest habitat because it has many different living things and it’s easy to find examples in books and online. I know that forests have lots of trees, so I'll start with tall trees with detailed bark and green canopies. Next, I'll add bushes and flowering plants with bright, vibrant colors. Animals like squirrels and birds are common in forests, so I'll draw a squirrel climbing a tree and a bird perched on a branch. I remember to place some insects like butterflies on the flowers. To show the terrain, I’ll draw uneven ground with patches of grass and some fallen leaves. Now, I'll add clear, blue sky and some clouds in the background. I’ll make sure to label the trees, the bushes, and the animals I know, like oak trees, blue jays, etc. But I might miss labeling a small insect like an ant or a beetle. I'm not entirely sure about certain obscure plants or insects, but that's okay. I feel confident about depicting a pond habitat next to the forest, with fishes and frogs jumping from the lily pads. I’ll label significant parts, like the pond and some of the plants and animals.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of a forest habitat with tall trees having rugged bark and green canopies. There are brightly colored bushes and flowering plants scattered on the forest floor. A squirrel climbs a tree, and a bird with blue feathers perches on a branch. Butterflies hover over vibrant flowers. The ground features patches of green grass, fallen leaves, and uneven terrain. In the background, there's a clear sky with fluffy white clouds. A pond is depicted nearby with calm blue water, lily pads floating on the surface, and frogs and fishes in and around the water. Labels identify oak trees, blue jays, Squirrels, and the pond. The drawing style is realistic with rich detail and vibrant colors, reflecting an advanced level of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to include detailed elements of a specific habitat and accurately draw common plants and animals, such as trees, birds, and squirrels, as well as depict both land and water ecosystems. The omission of small details like not labeling every insect reflects potential struggles the student might have. The realistic and detailed style corresponds to the advanced level of completeness and accuracy expected from the student."
