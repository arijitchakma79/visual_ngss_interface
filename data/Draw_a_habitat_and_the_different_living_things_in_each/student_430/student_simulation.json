  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a land habitat. I think a playground could be a habitat, so I'll make a big green patch for the grass. I'll draw one big tree because trees are important, and put some squirrels around it. I know squirrels live in trees. Next, I'll draw a smaller, separate pond. I'll sketch some water with blue waves and make a fish in it, since I know fish live in water. I think I should add some more things to the pond, but I only know water means fish. I’ll put another tree near the water because I think that looks nice. I might add another animal but I'm not sure what else should live in the pond.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a simple land habitat and a water habitat. The land habitat has a grassy area with a large tree, and two squirrels scattered around it. In the water habitat, there's a small pond with blue wavy lines to show water and one fish. Another tree is placed close to the pond. The drawing is colorful, with green for the grass and trees, brown for the squirrels, and blue for the water. It has a simplistic, childlike style, representing a developing understanding of habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a basic land habitat with a tree and squirrels, and a simple water habitat with minimal aquatic life—a fish. It reflects the misunderstandings by placing a tree in both settings and lacking variety in the pond, which demonstrates the student's struggle to distinguish between habitats and limited knowledge of different water-based organisms."
