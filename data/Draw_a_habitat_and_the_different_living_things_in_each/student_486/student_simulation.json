  "Reasoning": "I remember that my task is to draw a habitat and show the different living things in it. I think I'll draw a forest because I like trees. First, I'll sketch some big trees; they’re mostly tall with green leaves, like a simple triangle on a stick. I'll add a few smaller trees too, but they all look the same to me. Oh, I'll put some flowers on the ground; they're easy and colorful. For animals, I'll draw a squirrel in the tree because I see them a lot in movies. Maybe I should add a bird too, maybe flying above the trees. I know fish are in lakes, but I'm not sure if they fit in a forest, so I won't draw any water. I should spread the trees and animals out across the whole page, but I'm not sure how they fit together or why some animals are in certain spots. I think the forest isn't very different from other places I've seen, maybe just the trees change. I don't know exactly what makes habitats unique, like I’m mixing things up with another place.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple forest scene that includes tall, triangular trees with green leaves scattered across the page. Include basic flower shapes on the ground and simple animal figures like a squirrel in a tree and a bird flying above. Use a variety of greens and browns for the plants and bright colors for the flowers and animals. The style should be child-like, with minimal detail and a sense of emerging understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability to draw a basic representation of a habitat with typical elements like trees and simple animals but shows a lack of diversity and understanding of specific habitat characteristics or how living things are organized. The task reflects their emerging capability, as there is some depiction of a habitat but not with full detail or accuracy."
