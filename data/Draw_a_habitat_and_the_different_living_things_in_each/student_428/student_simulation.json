  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the land habitat. I remember that a forest has lots of trees, so I'll start with tall, green trees and add some bushes. I want to make sure I include a few different animals, like squirrels, lizards, and ants, because those are common in forests. The squirrels can go on tree branches, the lizard on a rock, and ants on the ground. Next, I'll draw the water habitat, like a pond. I'll make it look different from the land by adding blue for the water and have fish and clams in there. Fish swimming and clams at the bottom of the pond can illustrate the water habitat. Don't forget to draw some plants like cattails by the pond’s edge. In both habitats, I need to show different plants and animals, so I’ll use different shades of green for trees and grass, and bright colors for flowers. Finally, I'll label each animal and plant. I have to be careful not to miss any labels, even though sometimes I miss minor ones.",
  "Prompt": "A student's drawing displaying two distinct habitats. On the left, a vibrant forest scene with tall green trees, bushes, colorful flowers, a squirrel on a branch, a lizard on a rock, and ants on the ground. On the right, a pond with light blue water, detailed fish swimming, clams at the pond bottom, and green cattails around the edge. There are various shades of green representing grasses and trees, alongside bright-colored flowers. The style is detailed and carefully labeled with the names of the animals and plants. The overall composition is colorful and shows a thoughtful representation of each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The student's drawing prompt reflects the ability to accurately depict both land and water habitats with appropriate living things, which aligns with their 'can do' abilities. There is a focus on the diversity of living organisms and habitats, highlighting accuracy for an advanced level. The prompt also notes careful labeling, which addresses the minor gap in potentially incomplete labeling, as noted in the 'cannot do' section."
