  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a land habitat. I'll make it a playground because I see those often. I'll sketch the playground with some trees, grass, and maybe a bush. I remember seeing birds like robins and squirrels in playgrounds, so I’ll draw those too. I know gardens have flowers, butterflies, and maybe even bees, so I'll include those details as well. Next, I'll draw a water habitat like a pond. I'll draw lily pads with frogs sitting on them, some fish in the water, and ducks swimming. On the edges of the pond, I'll add cattails. I’m comparing the land and water habitats as I draw, remembering that frogs can live in both, so I'll make sure to put frogs in both scenes, but keep the fish strictly in the water. I know that some plants are only on land, like shrubs and flowers, while others, like algae, are just in water. For each, I'll carefully label what I draw: robin, squirrel, daisy, frog, lily pad, fish, duck, cattail. Sometimes I might forget to write a name or draw something a bit too big or small, like a bee bigger than a robin by mistake, but that’s okay. It’s still easy to see that I know where each thing belongs.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two distinct habitats: on the left, a land habitat depicting a playground with green grass, a couple of trees, a bush, a robin perched on a tree branch, a squirrel nearby, flowers like daisies, and butterflies. On the right, a water habitat with a blue pond featuring lily pads, frogs on the pads, fish swimming beneath, a duck on the water, and cattails on the shore. There is an intentional mix of creatures in environments like frogs on both sides and detailed labeling of plants and animals in colorful, slightly stylized, and simplified drawings.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate and differentiate between land and water habitats while labeling accurately. It reflects the student's strengths in depicting specific plants and animals in their habitats, along with the occasional oversight or stylization in drawing, aligning with their level and description."
