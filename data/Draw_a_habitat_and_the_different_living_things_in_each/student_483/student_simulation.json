  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a scene with both land and water since I know I should show a habitat with these features. I'll draw a savanna beside a river because I remember learning about the animals and plants that live there. On the land, I’ll add some acacia trees and tall grasses, which I know are common plants in the savanna. Then, I'll draw some animals like zebras and giraffes near the trees, as I've seen pictures of them grazing there. To show more variety, I'll include a few birds in the sky and maybe a lion relaxing in the shade, because lions are also part of the savanna. For the river, I'll draw it winding through the scene with a couple of fish swimming. I'll add a hippopotamus partly submerged in the river to show how some animals live in water too. I’ll label some of these, like zebras and giraffes, and write 'hippopotamus' near the water. I think a crocodile could be near the water too because I learned they live by rivers. I'll make sure the colors look bright like the savanna – yellows and greens for the land and blue for the river. Even though I’m trying to show where different animals live, I might accidentally spread them too evenly, forgetting to cluster more around water. I hope I have the names right, but I worry about getting a type wrong like calling an acacia something it isn't.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of a savanna habitat. The land features acacia trees and tall grasses, shown in bright yellows and greens. Zebras and giraffes are grazing near the trees, a lion rests in the shade, and birds fly in a clear blue sky. A winding river divides the scene, depicted in vibrant blue, with fish swimming and a hippopotamus lounging partly submerged in the water. A crocodile lurks near the water's edge. Some animals and plants are labeled with names like 'zebra', 'giraffe', and 'hippopotamus', while the distribution of animals is simplified and not always clustered around water sources. The drawing is in a childlike, simplistic style with clear, bold lines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and differentiate between land and water environments by including a savanna and river. It shows various living things found in such a habitat, with attempts at labeling common species, demonstrating effort to note diversity within the habitat. The scene's simplified representation of animal distribution corresponds to the student's challenge in consistently showing ecological patterns, such as clustering animals around water naturally, and showcases the risk of mislabeling someone due to minor knowledge gaps."
