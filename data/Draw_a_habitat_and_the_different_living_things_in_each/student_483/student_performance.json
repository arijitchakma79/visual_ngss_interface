    "The student may inconsistently label some features or incorrectly name a species or habitat element due to minor gaps in knowledge (e.g., labeling a pine tree in a tropical rainforest).",
    "The student might show a simplified representation of patterns in living things' distribution and miss more subtle ecological interactions (e.g., illustrating animals evenly spread when some should be shown near water sources)."
