  "Reasoning": "I remember we're supposed to draw a habitat and the living things in it. I'll start by drawing a big tree because I see those in the park near my house. I'll make sure to color it green and brown. Next, I'll add a squirrel near the tree because I know squirrels live in trees. I'll also draw an ant on the ground since I see ants in the park too. For a water habitat, I think of a pond. I'm not sure what exactly is in a pond, but I'll draw it anyway. I'll just add some wavy blue lines for water. I remember there are fish in water but I'm not sure how to draw one, so I'll skip that. Overall, my drawing has a tree with a squirrel and an ant. I think I should label them, so I'll write 'tree' next to the tree and 'squirrel' near the squirrel, but I might forget to label the ant. I'm not sure what else should go in the pond or how to show more details, so I'll leave it there.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple landscape showing two habitats: A land habitat on the left side with a large green tree, a brown squirrel on the tree, and a small ant on the ground. On the right side, show a pond with just blue wavy lines to indicate water. Include the labels 'tree' next to the tree and 'squirrel' near the squirrel. Use a basic and colorful drawing style appropriate for a young student, with simple shapes and clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to identify basic elements of a land habitat, like a tree and a squirrel, along with the attempt to include a water habitat despite limited details. It reflects the student's correct labeling of some elements while omitting others, such as the ant or water-specific creatures in the pond. The random and sparse details illustrate the lack of clear understanding of plant and animal diversity patterns, aligning with what the student cannot do."
