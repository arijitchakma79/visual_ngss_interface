  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might attempt to draw a habitat like a playground or garden but with little detail or accuracy (e.g., basic shapes without context).",
    "The student could potentially draw a few living things like a tree or an animal but might not represent them accurately (e.g., tree as a stick with a circle on top)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly represent different habitats or show any distinction between them (e.g., playground and forest look the same).",
    "The student does not include or correctly label various types of plants or animals (e.g., might draw random shapes or objects instead of plants and animals).",
    "The student cannot organize or label the different living things to show diversity (e.g., no labels or incorrect labels).",
    "The student cannot demonstrate patterns or compare different habitats effectively (e.g., may group animals randomly without regard to habitat)."
