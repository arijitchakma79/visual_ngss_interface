  "Reasoning": "I'll draw a place outside. Maybe I'll make a playground because I like playing there. I'll draw a big rectangle for the ground. Then, I’ll add some lines to make swings, but they look like sticks. I think there is a tree, so I'll make a big stick with a circle on top for the tree. I remember animals are in habitats, so I'll add a dog next to the tree. The dog will be an oval with some lines for legs. I’ll put a few circles around because I think those could be other animals or maybe bushes, but they don't look very detailed. I can't remember what exactly lives there, so I'll just draw what I think might be outside.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple playground with minimal details. Include a rectangle for the ground, stick-like swing sets, and a basic tree represented as a stick with a circle on top. Add an animal figure near the tree resembling an oval with lines for legs, portraying a dog. Include random circles around the area to represent other animals or bushes. Use simple colors like green for the ground, brown for the tree trunk, and gray for the swings. The style should reflect simple beginner-level doodling with minimal detail.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's attempt to draw a recognizable outdoor area like a playground with basic shapes such as rectangles, circles, and lines, aligning with their ability to draw habitats with minimal detail. The representation of the tree and animal using simple shapes corresponds to their limited understanding of accurately depicting living things. The inclusion of random shapes in various parts of the drawing captures their inability to organize, label, or differentiate between habitats and living creatures."
