  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a playground. I know I need to label it, so I'll make sure to write 'Playground' at the top. I’ll add a few trees and some grass, and I’ll remember to label them because those are the more obvious plants. Next, I'll draw a forest. I’ll put in several trees and label them, along with some squirrels since I know they live in forests. For the water habitats, I’ll draw a pond and a stream. I’ll add fish to the pond and will label them, but I’ll probably forget to label any clams since I might not recognize them. For plants in the water habitats, I'll draw some grass-like plants around the edges of the pond and stream and label them, but I might forget bushes or flowering plants since they’re less obvious to me. I’ll try to compare the habitats by noticing the squirrels are only in the forest and fish are only in the pond, but I might not get into details like which animals need which plants. I have to be careful not to confuse where each animal belongs, like not putting a lizard in the pond by accident.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two land habitats and two water habitats. The first land habitat is a playground, with labeled elements like trees and grass. The second is a forest, with several trees labeled and a couple of squirrels, also labeled. For water habitats, there's a pond with fish shown and labeled, surrounded by labeled grass-like plants. A stream is also drawn, with similar plant labeling but less detail in other living things. The drawing is colorful with an effortful, hand-drawn style typical of young students, using crayons or colored pencils. Some less obvious plants and aquatic animals like clams or bushes might be missing labels or not drawn.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including labeled elements like trees, squirrels, and fish which the student can handle well. It also reflects gaps by not labeling less obvious plants like bushes and clams, indicating what the student might miss. The drawing style reflects a proficient level of effort but contains typical beginner omissions, displaying clear, recognizable elements but lacking finer-detail comparisons or interactions between species and habitats."
