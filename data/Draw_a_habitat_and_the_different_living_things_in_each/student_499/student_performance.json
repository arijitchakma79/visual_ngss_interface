  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label different land habitats such as a playground and a forest, providing correct labels for some elements.",
    "The student can draw and label different water habitats like a pond and a stream, although not all labels may be complete.",
    "The student can include and correctly label various plants in each habitat, such as trees and grasses, and most labels are present and accurate.",
    "The student can include and label different animals in each habitat, successfully identifying species like squirrels in the forest and fish in the pond.",
    "The student can show patterns by comparing the variety of living things seen across different habitats, though some comparisons may not be deeply detailed."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally miss labeling less obvious plants like bushes or flowering plants (e.g., the student forgets to label them or does not recognize them).",
    "The student might inconsistently identify less common animals such as clams in a pond habitat (e.g., the student may think they are fish or might not include them at all).",
    "Some comparisons between habitats may be missing finer points, such as the specific dependence of certain animals on particular plants (e.g., fewer detailed interactions are shown).",
    "The student might misplace a few animals or confuse their habitats, such as placing a lizard in a pond instead of a dry land habitat (e.g., the student misidentifies habitat needs)."
