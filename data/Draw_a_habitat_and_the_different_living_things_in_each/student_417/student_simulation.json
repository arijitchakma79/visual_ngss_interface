  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a habitat. Hmm, let’s make it a big open space. I like trees, so I’ll start by drawing a big tree in the middle. Next, I think a bird should go on the tree; birds live in trees, right? I'll draw a bird on a branch. Now for the ground... grass is part of nature, so I'll add some green scribbles for grass. Maybe a pond should go next. It’s blue with a wavy shape. What else lives here? Oh! I could put a big animal, like a dog. I think they like nature too. Ugh, I forgot to label - I'll just draw lines... maybe, and leave some blank labels. Let's see, there are some clouds in the sky... and maybe hills far away in the background. Done! That’s my habitat!",
  "Prompt": "Create a child’s drawing of a generic outdoor habitat with a large tree in the center. Include a simple representation of a bird on a branch. Below the tree, depict green scribbles for grass and a wavy, blue pond beside it. Add a simplistic, out-of-place dog nearby. Spread sparse clouds in a blue sky and simple, rounded hills in the distant background. Leave space for unlabeled lines around the tree and animals to indicate labels. Use crayon-style strokes with bright colors appropriate for a child’s drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to attempt drawing a simple, generic habitat without clearly defining it, and to include basic living things like a tree and bird. The student struggles to accurately depict and organize different habitats, fails to label or identify specific species correctly, and mixes habitats by placing a dog in the scene. The style (crayon-like) and simplicity are age-appropriate and suitable for the student's current understanding and skill level."
