  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student is likely able to attempt drawing a simple habitat but may not clearly identify it as a specific type (e.g., a generic open space that is not clearly a garden, forest, etc.).",
    "The student might include a few living things, such as a tree or an animal, without specific details or variety (e.g., draws a tree and a bird but not different types of plants or animals)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately compare two different habitats or show the differences between them in their drawing (e.g., habitats look similar or are indistinct).",
    "The student may not show patterns or organization in the drawing, such as grouping plants and animals logically according to habitat (e.g., animals scattered randomly without context).",
    "The student might not label the types of living things correctly or at all, missing opportunities to identify specific species (e.g., draws an animal but doesn't label it as a 'squirrel' or 'fish').",
    "Misunderstandings may include incorrect depictions of habitats (e.g., drawing a penguin next to a cactus in a desert habitat)."
