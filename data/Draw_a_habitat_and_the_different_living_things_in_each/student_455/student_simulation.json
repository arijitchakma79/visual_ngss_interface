  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I know that forests have many trees, so I'll add a variety of trees with different shapes and sizes to make it look lively. I'll draw some birds flying or sitting on branches and squirrels close to the trees because they live in forests. I need to include some flowers and bushes too. Oh, and I can't forget to add labels like 'tree', 'bird', and 'squirrel'. Next, I'll draw a pond habitat. I'll start by creating a big blue area for the water and add a few fish swimming underneath. I'll put some water plants like lily pads on the surface; they look different than the plants in the forest. I nearly forgot! I should draw some insects buzzing above or near the water. I need to remember to label these as well, like 'fish' and 'water plant'. Lastly, I'll compare these habitats by showing that while both have plants and animals, the types are different. Oh no! I realize I drew a fish on a tree branch by mistake; I probably mixed up their places while trying to depict the biodiversity. Also, I don't really know what other water animals like clams look like, so I'll skip those. I think some flowers are unlabeled, which might confuse someone looking at the drawing.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two distinct habitats. First, on the left, a forest habitat with several types of trees, birds resting on branches, and squirrels on the ground. Flowers and small bushes are scattered around. The trees, birds, and squirrels are labeled. On the right, a pond habitat with a large blue pond filled with swimming fish, some brown and green lily pads floating on the water, and insects flying nearby. Only some items like 'fish' and 'water plant' are correctly labeled. Thereâ€™s a small mistake with a fish drawn on a tree branch. The scene uses bright colors and has a lively, childlike drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as it includes a variety of living things in both habitats and some elements are correctly labeled, demonstrating an understanding of biodiversity. However, it also reflects the student's misunderstandings, including the misplaced fish and unlabeled flowers, showing a typical Level 3 proficiency where most elements are present but some misunderstandings and incomplete labeling occur."
