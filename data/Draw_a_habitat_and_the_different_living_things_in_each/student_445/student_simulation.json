  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a habitat. I think a habitat is a place where things live, like maybe a pond or a playground. I'll start with a big circle to show a pond. I'm not really sure how to make it look different from a playground, but I'll just use a circle for now. I remember that trees are living things, so I'll draw a tree next to the pond. I think I've seen fish in ponds too, so I'll try drawing a fish in the water. I don't really know what other animals might live in a pond, so I'll just stick with the fish. I might put another tree on the other side of the pond just to make it look nice. I know playgrounds also have people and trees, but I'm not sure how to show that differently. So, I'll use another circle to show a playground next to the pond and put another tree there. Trees seem to go everywhere, right?",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple cartoon-style illustration showing two separate circles labeled as habitats. The first circle is labeled 'Pond' and contains a cartoonish tree and a fish. The second circle, labeled 'Playground', has a similar cartoonish tree. Use bright, basic colors for the pond and playground areas. The drawing should look like it was done by a young child, with simple shapes and a playful, simplistic art style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can and cannot do because it reflects their ability to draw basic shapes to represent habitats without distinguishing between them. They include a couple of common living things, like a tree and a fish, without accurately placing or diversifying them according to specific habitats. The use of simple shapes and repetition of trees across both habitats demonstrates their struggle to show diversity and difference between environments."
