    "The student cannot accurately represent a variety of living things specific to each habitat, such as different plants and animals*(student lacks knowledge of habitat-specific species)*.",
    "The student cannot compare and show plants and animals as similar or different between habitats (e.g., doesn't illustrate that squirrels are found in forests but not in ponds) *(student lacks comparison skills)*.",
    "The student does not show observable patterns of diversity within habitats (e.g., might repeat the same plant or animal for different environments) *(student misses the concept of diversity)*."
