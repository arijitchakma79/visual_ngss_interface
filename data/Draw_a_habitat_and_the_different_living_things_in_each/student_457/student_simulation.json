  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a habitat and some living things. I think I'll start with a big rectangle at the bottom of the page for land. I should add another shape for water, maybe a wavy line to show there is water there. For the living things, I'll make some circles and blobs. I'll put some circles on the land and some blobs in the water. I don't remember the right names for different places like where the animals live, so I'll just draw anyway. I saw some fish in pictures, but maybe those can go on the land too. I'm not sure what plants should go in the water, so I'll just put them anywhere. Itâ€™s hard to remember which animals go where, so I'll just spread them out randomly.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing showing a simple land and water scene. At the bottom, a large rectangle represents the land. Above it, a wavy line illustrates water. Scattered within the land area are several circles meant to be animals, and in the water area, there are several ambiguous blob shapes. The coloring is basic and uses simple crayons with various colors. There are no labels, and the details of the living things are minimal.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's understanding and skill level. The student can draw basic shapes to represent land and water but struggles with more detailed labels and proper placement of animals and plants. The drawing includes generalized shapes like circles and blobs meant to represent living things. The composition lacks accurate distinctions between habitat types and does not feature appropriate living organisms for each habitat."
