  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw some basic elements like a simple shape meant to represent a land or water habitat but without specific detail (e.g., a rectangle for land or a wavy line for water).",
    "The student might include very generalized shapes for animals and plants without clear distinction or accurate labeling (e.g., blobs or circles to signify living things)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly label different types of habitats such as 'forest' or 'pond' (student may not have the vocabulary or understanding to differentiate).",
    "The student is unlikely to show specific types of plants or animals accurately within the habitats (e.g., may put a fish in a land habitat or a tree underwater).",
    "The student does not illustrate unique features of each habitat or make accurate comparisons between different living things in each (e.g., lacks understanding that different animals live in different habitats).",
    "The student cannot effectively highlight patterns of diversity across habitats (e.g., might incorrectly draw the same plant and animal in all habitats)."
