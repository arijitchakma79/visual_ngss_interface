  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a habitat. I remember that forests have trees, so I'll draw a couple of tall trees. I think squirrels and birds live there, so I'll add those too. I should draw grass because that's often in forests. I know water is usually near habitats, so I'll add some waves for a pond and draw a simple fish shape. I might forget some plants or animals, and I'm not sure if I'm putting everything in the right place. Oh, I hope the trees don't look too similar to each other. Maybe I should put fish near the trees, but the fish lives in water, right? It's a bit confusing.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a forest habitat with a few large, green trees and patches of grass. Simple cartoon-like animals, such as a basic squirrel and a bird, are shown. There are wavy lines representing a pond with a simple fish shape nearby. The drawing is colorful, mainly using greens, browns, and blues, in a simplistic style with bold outlines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's understanding by including tall trees and basic animal shapes like squirrels and birds, reflecting their ability to show basic elements of a forest. The inclusion of simple water features and a basic fish shape shows the student's comprehension of adding aquatic elements. However, it also reflects potential misunderstandings, like potential mix-ups of placing fish too close to trees, and not fully showing the diversity of a habitat. The simplistic drawing style matches the student's developing level of proficiency in depicting the habitat."
