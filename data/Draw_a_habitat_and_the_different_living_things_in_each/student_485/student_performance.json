    "Draw basic shapes that might represent land and water, though not clearly identified (e.g., a patch of green next to a blue shape).",
    "Include a few recognizable living things, like simple stick trees or generalized animals (e.g., circles with short lines for legs)."

  "CANNOT": [
    "Distinguish clearly between land and water habitats (e.g., may place fish among trees without a pond shape).",
    "Illustrate specific plants and animals to show diversity (e.g., all creatures look similar, possibly all unidentifiable as specific living things).",
    "Demonstrate comparisons between different habitats (e.g., fails to show differences between a forest and a pond).",
    "Use patterns to show how different habitats support different kinds of plants and animals (e.g., identical representations of living things in both habitats)."
