  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a habitat with living things in it. First, I'll draw a big green patch on the left side of the paper. That's the land part, I think. Now, I'll draw a blue shape next to the green one. That can be some water, maybe a pond or something. I'll put some stick trees on the green patch because I know trees live on land. Oh, I think I'll also draw some simple animals. Maybe I'll make a cat or a dog shapeâ€”just a circle with lines for legs. I'll also draw a fish, but I'm not too sure where to put it. I'll put it near that tree because I like fish, even though they live in water. I don't know how to draw other plants or animals so they look different, so I'll draw more of the same, like more stick trees and maybe some more circle animals. This seems like a lot, but it looks like a habitat with living things in it.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a habitat featuring a green patch and blue shape representing land and water. The drawing includes simple stick trees on the green patch. There are a few animals, depicted as circles with short lines for legs; some are placed unrealistically together, like a fish near a tree. The drawing uses a basic, colorful style with bright green and blue, and simple lines to outline the living things. The animals and plants appear similar and are generally unidentifiable.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as they can draw basic shapes for land and water and a few simple living things. However, it reflects their struggles by placing a fish unrealistically near a tree, showing no clear distinction between habitats. The uniform style of the animals demonstrates the lack of diversity in their portrayal. The drawing style is suitable for a beginner and matches the student's level description."
