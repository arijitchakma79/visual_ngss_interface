  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a forest habitat. I’ll include different types of trees like oaks and pines, and label them. I remember squirrels live here, so I’ll draw one and label it. I will also draw some grasses. Next, I’ll draw a pond habitat. Let’s add some lily pads and cattails. Fish live in ponds, so I need to draw and label them too. I’ll also add a frog. Now, I’ll create a garden habitat. I know gardens have flowering plants, so I’ll draw roses and tulips. I think I’ll also add a rabbit because they can be in gardens. I have to be careful to label everything. Sometimes I forget, though, so I need to double-check. I’m trying to show diversity and patterns like trees and flowers being in different places. I might mix up species names, like calling the pine an oak by mistake, but I think I remember most of these correctly.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three distinct habitats: a forest with oak and pine trees where a labeled squirrel and grasses are present; a pond with lily pads, cattails, labeled fish, and a frog; and a garden with labeled roses, tulips, and a rabbit. The drawing should be colorful, using greens for the trees and grasses, blues for the pond, and varied bright colors for the flowers. The style should be like a child's drawing, with some elements possibly mislabeled or missing labels, and a sense of careful effort to show diversity.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label different habitats with a range of living things in each. It also reflects their proficiency level by including potential inaccuracies like mislabeled species or missing labels. The drawing style reflects a Level 3 student's efforts, showing patterns of diversity and the inclusion of different types of plants and animals in each habitat."
