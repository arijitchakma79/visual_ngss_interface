  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a land habitat, specifically a forest. I remember that forests have a lot of trees, so I'll start with drawing tall trees with green leaves. These trees are home to animals like squirrels and ants. I’ll make sure to label the trees and draw a squirrel climbing a tree with a bushy tail, and some ants crawling on the ground near the tree, which I’ll also label. Next, I'll move to draw a water habitat—a pond. There should be water plants like lilypads floating on the pond’s surface; I'll draw and label those. In the pond, I'll include fish swimming and a clam at the bottom. I'll try to add some grass around the pond shore to show biodiversity. I have to remember to label all the parts carefully, like the fish, the clam, and each water plant. I'll add vibrant colors to each element—brown for the tree trunks, green for the leaves and grass, and blue for the water. I know my goal is to show where each living thing belongs and how they all fit in the habitat. I might forget to label something minor like a small plant, but I'll try to check my work. I won’t spend much time on less common roles animals play, like specific symbiotic relationships, since it's not my main focus.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of two distinct habitats in vibrant colors: on the left, a lush forest with tall trees in different shades of green and brown, featuring a squirrel labeled 'Squirrel' on a tree branch and ants labeled 'Ants' on the ground. Each tree is labeled 'Tree'. On the right, a serene pond habitat with blue water, lilypads labeled 'Lilypad', a fish swimming near the surface labeled 'Fish', and a clam on the pond bottom labeled 'Clam'. Grass surrounds the pond, labeled 'Grass'. The drawing shows a clear distinction and intense detail, suitable for elementary student work with an advanced understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes elements that the student can accurately draw and label, like a forest and pond with specified living things, using lively colors and explicit labels. It ensures the student’s ability to illustrate a variety of organisms and their respective habitats, demonstrating biodiversity and clear understanding. Though detailed, the prompt allows room for minor omissions or less focus on specific ecological relationships, aligning with the student's potential challenges."
