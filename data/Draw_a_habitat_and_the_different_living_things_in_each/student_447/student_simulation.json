  "Reasoning": "I remember that habitats are like homes for plants and animals. I'll start with a forest habitat because I can imagine trees and animals there. I'll draw big trees like oaks and pines with green leaves, and I'll add a squirrel on a branch. I know squirrels live in forests. Underneath the trees, I'll draw some green bushes and a deer standing beside them because I've seen that in pictures before. Next to the forest part, I'll draw a garden habitat. Gardens have lots of colorful flowers, so I'll use colors like yellow, red, and purple to make them stand out. I'll add bees flying around the flowers since bees are common in gardens. I'll also put a butterfly because they like flowers, too. Now, I'll draw a water habitat, like a pond. I'll draw blue water with a fish swimming in it, and I'll make a frog sitting on a green lily pad because frogs and ponds go together. I’ll try my best to show these living things. I know that each habitat should look different because they support different life. I might forget to label all the animals correctly, but I'll label the ones I remember like 'squirrel' and 'fish'. Lastly, I’ll make sure there are different plants and animals in each habitat, even if I forget some details like rare animals or how trees provide shade.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing by an 8-year-old student illustrating three distinct habitats. On the left, a forest with tall, green-leaved oak and pine trees, a brown squirrel on a branch, and a deer among green bushes. In the middle, a vibrant garden with yellow, red, and purple flowers, bees buzzing, and a colorful butterfly. On the right, a pond habitat with blue water, a fish swimming, and a green lily pad supporting a small frog. The drawing uses bright, primary colors and a childlike, expressive style. The label 'squirrel' is placed near the animal in the forest, and 'fish' is noted near the swimming fish in the pond.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do well, such as identifying the main types of living things in different habitats and showing a variety of plants and animals. It also reflects the student's struggles, like forgetting to accurately label all species and possibly missing the specific interactions or adaptations within each habitat. The drawing style and use of bright colors align with the expected output from a student at a proficient level for their grade."
