  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may have difficulties in accurately labeling all species included in their habitat drawings (e.g., labels might be missing or incorrect).",
    "The student is likely unable to demonstrate a complete and sophisticated representation of all the unique features of each habitat, such as the specific adaptations of each plant or animal (student might only show general features).",
    "The student may show a limited understanding of rare or less commonly known living things in certain habitats (e.g., omitting simpler or unfamiliar species that inhabit these areas).",
    "Inconsistencies may occur in accurately showing the interaction between the living things and their environment (e.g., forgetting to show how some animals rely on certain plants for food)."
