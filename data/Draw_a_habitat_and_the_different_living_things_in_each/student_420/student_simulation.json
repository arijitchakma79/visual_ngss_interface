  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a forest habitat because I'm comfortable with that. I’ll draw tall trees with lots of leaves and some bushes underneath. Next, I'll add different animals like a lizard on a rock and a squirrel on a branch. I'll also make sure to draw the ground with grass and some fallen leaves. Now I'll start the pond habitat next to it, with water and plants like algae at the bottom. I'll put a few fish swimming and maybe a clam on the pond bed. After that, I'll look for patterns, comparing the number of different plants and animals in each habitat. I know I should label these, so I'll write 'forest' near the trees and 'pond' near the water. I'm trying to show that there are more varied plants in the forest than the pond, and the animals are of different sizes. Remember, the important part is organizing everything and making sure it’s clear what I’m showing. Oops, I almost forgot the desert, but I'm not entirely sure about all the specific plants there. I’ll draw a cactus and some sand dunes, but I’ll label just the cactus and 'desert'. Sometimes I mix up the species names, so I need to be careful with that. Let's keep it clear and clean with each part labeled.",
  "Prompt": "A well-organized drawing featuring a forest habitat on the left with tall green trees, a squirrel on a branch, and a lizard on a rock surrounded by bushes and grass. Next to it, a pond habitat with blue water, algae, fish swimming, and a clam on the pond bed. In the background, a desert habitat with a large cactus and sandy dunes. Each habitat is labeled clearly: 'Forest', 'Pond', and 'Desert'. The drawing is colorful and exhibits advanced detail, with various plant and animal sizes and patterns demonstrating differences between these habitats. Drawn in a realistic children's drawing style with vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities to draw different habitats with appropriate animals and plants and the skill to label and organize these elements clearly. It reflects the student's advanced level in depicting and comparing biodiversity while acknowledging their struggle with less familiar habitats like the desert, where more specific plant details are omitted."
