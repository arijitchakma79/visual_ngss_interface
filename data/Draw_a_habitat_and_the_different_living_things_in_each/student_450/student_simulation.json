  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a simple garden. I know gardens usually have some low plants and maybe a couple of trees. I'll add a few green bushes, but I'm not sure what else to add. Ok, I'll draw a tree next to them. Gardens should have some flowers, so I'll make a couple of red and yellow flowers. Now, let me try a pond habitat. A pond would have water, so I'll draw a blue circle for water. I remember ponds can have fish, so I'll add a fish shape in the water. I'm going to add a plant here too, maybe a couple of reeds coming out of the pond. I'm not sure what animals live around a pond, so I'll just leave it like this. I'll write 'bushes' next to the bushes, and 'fish' near the fish. Oh, I should add labels for the flowers too, but I'm not sure what they should be called, so I'll just skip those. Do fish also live in gardens? I'm not sure, but maybe I’ll put another fish with the tree, just in case.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting two simple habitats: a garden and a pond. The garden is roughly illustrated with a few green bushes, a single tree, and a couple of red and yellow flowers. The pond is shown as a blue circle with a simplistic fish drawn inside. There are a couple of green reeds near the pond. Labels that read 'bushes' and 'fish' are visible, with some elements unlabelled. The style is very basic and childlike, using crayons with colors that are bright and primary, without much detail or variation in species.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw simple habitats with basic elements like bushes, trees, and water with fish, matching their understanding level. It aligns with their struggle to diversify living things within the habitat, limited labelling skills, and potential misplacement of species, all indicative of their developmental stage."
