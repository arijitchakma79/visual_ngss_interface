  "Reasoning": "I think I'm supposed to draw a place where animals and plants live, like a home for them. I know what a rectangle looks like, so I'll draw a big rectangle and maybe that's the habitat? I think I heard something about a pond before so maybe that's a place. I'm going to draw a shape like a circle in the rectangle to represent water. I remember fish live in water, so I'll try to draw a fish, but I'm not sure if it looks right. I'll add a tree next to it because trees belong outside, I think. Maybe I should also add a sun to make it look nice. I don't know how to label the things, so I won't. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to add more animals or plants, so I'll just draw a lizard somewhere because I like them. I hope this is good enough.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a basic habitat in colored pencil style. The main feature is a large, undefined rectangle representing the habitat with a small circle inside it to represent water. There is a basic fish shape in the circle and a tree next to it. A simple sun is drawn in the sky. A lizard is drawn randomly in the same space. Colors are basic: blue for water, green for the tree, yellow for the sun, and a generic color for the fish and lizard.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's limited understanding and ability to represent a habitat. The rectangle is the simple shape the student can draw to signify a habitat, and the circle within it represents their attempt to show water without specific details. Including a fish and a tree matches their basic understanding of living things, despite the lack of accuracy or specificity. The lizard, placed randomly, highlights the student's misunderstanding of habitat needs. The absence of labels and lack of pattern or diversity in placing species reflect the student's level of understanding."
