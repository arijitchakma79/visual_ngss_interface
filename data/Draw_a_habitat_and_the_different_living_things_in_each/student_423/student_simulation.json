  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw two different habitats: a forest and a pond. I'll start with the forest. I remember forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw tall trees with lots of branches and leaves. I'll add a deer since I've seen that deer live in forests. I should also put birds in the trees because they belong there. Now, for the pond, I'll draw some water and put a frog on a lily pad because frogs live in ponds. I'll add some fish in the waterâ€”they definitely belong there too. I think of cacti, but I remember they belong in deserts, not forests, so I won't draw them here. Oh, I almost forgot to put some shrubs and smaller plants, but I'll try to add some. I might be missing some insects or small plants, though; I always forget those.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two habitats side by side. On one side, a vibrant forest with several tall trees with green leaves, a brown deer on the ground, and small birds perched in the branches. The other side features a peaceful pond with blue water, a green frog on a lily pad, and orange fish swimming below the water's surface. The forest ground has some shrubs, but no insects or really small plants are visible. The drawing is colorful, with crayons and markers, displaying a clear effort to show detail and the distinctiveness of each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by including detailed elements like trees, a deer, and birds for the forest, and frogs and fish for the pond. They show an understanding of where specific animals belong, like not placing cacti in the forest. The omission of smaller organisms like insects and the limited variety of smaller plants aligns with what the student cannot consistently remember to include, showing a focus on more obvious, larger creatures."
