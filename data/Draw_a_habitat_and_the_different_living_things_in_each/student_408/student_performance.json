    "The student can illustrate a wide variety of living things in each habitat, including specific trees, grasses, flowering plants, different animals like lizards, squirrels, and fish, ensuring representations are both diverse and habitat-appropriate.",
    "The student can effectively compare and contrast the different living things found in land habitats versus those found in water habitats with clarity and detail.",
    "The student can utilize observations from media or their own experiences to accurately depict the biodiversity of each habitat, showing a strong grasp of the diversity within each environment.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor details or labels, especially if they focus heavily on illustrating a complex ecosystem (e.g., not labeling a specific type of bush though accurately drawing it in context).",
    "The student might show some minor inconsistencies, such as slightly misplacing an animal or plant within a habitat due to overlapping elements (e.g., a small fish being drawn near but not in water, due to space constraints)."
