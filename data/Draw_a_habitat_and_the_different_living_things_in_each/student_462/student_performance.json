  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student is likely able to draw a basic representation of a habitat such as a playground, garden, or forest.",
    "The student can illustrate some common living things like trees, grass, or a particular animal (e.g., a squirrel in a forest) with basic formations.",
    "The student may start to label some living things but might do so inconsistently or without surety."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to illustrate a more complex or less familiar habitat, like a stream or lake (student might confuse it with simpler habitats).",
    "The student may not accurately show diversity or quantity of living things (e.g., might only draw one or two types of plants and animals without variation).",
    "The student might misunderstand or fail to show comparisons effectively, resulting in lack of labeled complexity or patterns across habitats (e.g., not recognizing the unique plants in a pond vs. a forest).",
    "The student is unlikely to fully recognize and represent observational patterns across different habitats (e.g., may draw the same animals in multiple habitats without considering differences)."
