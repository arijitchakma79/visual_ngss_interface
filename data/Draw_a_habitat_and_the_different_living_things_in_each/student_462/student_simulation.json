  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a simple forest habitat because I see forests a lot in stories and I think it's easier for me to remember. I’ll start by drawing big trees with some branches and maybe a few leaves to show they're alive. I remember also seeing squirrels in the forest, so I’ll draw a small squirrel sitting on one of the branches, but I might not get all the details right like its bushy tail. I'm not sure what else to add, so I'll put a patch of grass at the bottom, and I think there might be a bird, so I’ll draw a small bird in the sky. I remember that forests have a lot of trees and animals, but I can't think of other specific animals or plants right now. I’ll add some labels, but I'm not sure where to place all of them or if I'm naming them correctly. I remember ‘Tree’ and ‘Grass,’ so I’ll label those, but I’ll leave the squirrel and bird without labels because I don’t feel sure.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a forest habitat with simple, large trees with some branches and leaves. Include a small, simplified drawing of a squirrel sitting on one of the branches and a patch of grass at the bottom. In the sky, add a small, basic outline of a bird flying. The drawing should be colorful with labels 'Tree' and 'Grass' near the respective elements. Use simple, bold colors like green for trees and grass, brown for the tree trunks, and a mix of blue and yellow for the sky and bird. The style should be crayon-drawn with imperfect shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to create a basic representation of a familiar habitat—a forest—with some known elements like trees and squirrels. The attempt to label 'Tree' and 'Grass' shows emerging skills, but not being able to label the animals indicates uncertainty. The drawing captures the lack of complexity in showing diversity as only a few living things are included, and it avoids misunderstandings about less familiar habitats."
