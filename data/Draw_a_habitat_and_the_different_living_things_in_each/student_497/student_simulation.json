  "Reasoning": "Okay, I have to draw a habitat with different living things in it. I think I'll draw a garden because I remember seeing one outside my school. I'll start with a big rectangle for the area of the garden. I remember gardens have trees, so I'll draw two big green shapes for trees in the garden. I won't label them because I'm not sure how. There should also be some flowers; I'll draw a few colorful circles to look like flowers but I won't label them either. For animals, I think I'll draw a few little circles with legs and call them bugs, but I won’t write anything so I won't get it wrong. I'm not too sure about other animals, so I'll leave it at that. Hmm, water habitats are hard, so I won’t include any water or ponds because I might mix things up. I'll try to put the things I've drawn in different spots, hoping they look okay. I can't remember what goes where, so I'll just imagine it. I hope this looks like a garden!",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing of a garden habitat. The scene includes a big rectangle representing the garden area. There are two large green blob shapes for trees in the garden (unlabeled), and a few colorful circles representing flowers (also unlabeled). Small circles with stick legs are scattered around, representing bugs (without labels). The drawing has no water features. The placement of trees, flowers, and bugs doesn't follow specific organization, just randomly placed. The style is colorful and drawn with broad pencil-like strokes, reflecting a beginner's attempt.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a basic land habitat, such as a garden, with some living things like trees and bugs depicted in their drawing. However, it stays true to their confusion and lack of proper labels. The absence of water features like ponds aligns with what they cannot do, avoiding the risk of incorrect depiction. There's also no clear pattern or organization of living things or distinction between types, aligning with their misunderstandings and alignment with a beginning level understanding."
