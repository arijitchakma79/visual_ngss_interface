  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a habitat. I'll start with a land habitat. I'll draw a big flat green area for the land. I think I'll add a tree because trees grow on land. I can draw some grass too. Hmm, what animal? I know, I'll draw a lion here even though I'm not sure where they belong...maybe next to the tree. I want to try a water habitat now. I’ll draw some wavy blue lines for water. Let's see, I think fish live in water, so I'll draw a fish here. Maybe a crab too, those are water animals, right? Oh, I forgot, I'll draw the fish on the land next to the tree because my water space is too small. I can put a flower in the water to make it look nice. I want to draw more animals, but they all look the same. I'll draw three lions instead. I'm trying to add labels, but I'm not sure how to spell the names or what some of the animals are called, so I won't label them. This looks okay to me!",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing of a habitat showing a simple green land area with a tree and three identical lions nearby. Wavy blue lines depict water next to the land, with a fish drawn incorrectly on the land next to the tree. A crab is placed in the water section along with a flower, demonstrating confusion about appropriate habitats. The overall drawing is colorful, using bright colors like green, blue, and brown, but lacks accurate details or animal diversity. Features are simple with no labels or specific patterns, drawn in a basic, childlike style using crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's abilities by illustrating basic elements like a habitat attempt and a couple of living things, like a tree and fish. It captures the misunderstandings in habitat placement and diversity, such as misplacing animals and using them repetitively. Not labeling components reflects the student's difficulty with naming conventions. The presence of fictional elements, such as a flower in water, shows imagination over observation, aligning with being at the Beginning level."
