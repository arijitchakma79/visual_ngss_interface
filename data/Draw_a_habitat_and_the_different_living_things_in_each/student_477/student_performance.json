  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately show different areas in the habitat (e.g., mistakenly placing fish on land) (student doesn't understand habitat boundaries).",
    "The student cannot consistently or correctly show a variety of plants and animals appropriate to the habitat (e.g., might mix desert animals with aquatic plants) (student lacks knowledge of species and their habitats).",
    "The student does not illustrate patterns in the diversity of plants and animals (e.g., all animals drawn may look the same) (student lacks understanding of diversity).",
    "The student is unlikely to label different types of living things, or labels may be incorrect or missing (student does not know naming conventions or relations).",
    "The student cannot effectively show different habitats or make a clear comparison between a land habitat and a water habitat (drawing lacks distinction between habitats).",
    "The drawing does not reflect observations of actual habitat diversity and may include fictional elements (student likely uses imagination over observation)."
