  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the forest land habitat. I remember that forests have a variety of plants, so I'll include different types of trees. I'll add bushes and some grasses on the forest floor. Next, I’ll draw a few animals, like squirrels in the trees, and ants on the ground. I'll also draw a lizard on a rock. I’ll remember to label the trees, bushes, and the animals like the instructions say. Now, I'll move on to the water habitat, like a pond. I’ll draw some aquatic plants like reeds and floating weeds. For animals, I'll add fish swimming, frogs by the edge of the pond, and snails on the plants. I’ll try to label everything properly, but I might get one or two labels incorrect, like maybe I might call a bush a flowering plant because they look similar. I'll also include groups of animals in each habitat to show how they hang out together, like clusters of fish and groups of ants, to show biodiversity patterns. I know I don’t need to show every tiny thing, like micro-habitat details, so I’ll focus on what I can do best.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting two habitats: A forest and a pond. On the left, a forest scene features several types of trees, bushes, and grasses with animals like squirrels, a lizard, and ants - squirrels are drawn up in trees, ants crawling on the ground, and the lizard on a rock. On the right, a pond scene shows aquatic plants like reeds and floating weeds with fish swimming, frogs sitting by the edge, and snails on the plants. The drawing is colorful and labels are clearly visible, although a bush might be mislabeled as a flowering plant. Display patterns of biodiversity by showing groups clustering together like ants and fish. The drawing reflects an advanced grade-schooler's attention to detail, but excludes intricate micro-habitat details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt ensures that both the forest and pond habitats are accurately depicted, matching the student's abilities to show a variety of plants and animals in each. Clusters and specific animal positions show biodiversity patterns. Possible mislabeling of one or two plants aligns with noted misunderstandings. The focus on main habitats without micro-habitat details is consistent with the student's current level of comprehension."
