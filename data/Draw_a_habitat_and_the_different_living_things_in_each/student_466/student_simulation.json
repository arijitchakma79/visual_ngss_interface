  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a playground as a habitat because I see those often. I’ll start with a big tree, maybe an oak, and put it on one side. I remember trees have brown trunks and green leaves. Near the tree, I’ll add some flowers, using different colors like red and yellow, because they’ll make it look pretty. For animals, I know there’s always a squirrel in the trees at the playground and usually a dog walking around, so I’ll add those. I think I should try a water habitat too. I’ve seen a pond before, so I’ll draw some lily pads with fish underneath them. Hmm, I remember seeing frogs around lakes too, so let’s put a frog here, even if it's not perfect. I’ll try to put the playground garden on one side and the pond on the other, but I’m not sure if they really belong together. I just need to make sure I add a variety of living things. I might add a duck by the flowers since I’ve seen them in ponds, but it’s OK if it’s a little different.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful and simple drawing representing a playground as a land habitat on one side with a large green tree, some red and yellow flowers, a brown squirrel, and a small dog. On the other side, a pond as a water habitat is depicted with green lily pads, a few fish visible under the water, and a frog near the edge. There is a duck near the flowers. The drawing is done in a basic hand-drawn style typical for a young student, with bright colors and somewhat mixed details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s level because it includes the basic elements they can do: a simple playground with trees, flowers, and common animals, as well as a water habitat with mix of appropriate and inappropriate elements like fish and frogs. The details might be inconsistent like placing the duck or frog in a land habitat, showing the student's struggle to distinguish habitats accurately. The inclusion of a tree in the pond shows their struggle with habitat accuracy, and the somewhat random organization depicts their struggle to categorize correctly."
