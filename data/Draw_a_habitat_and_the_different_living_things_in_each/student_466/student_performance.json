  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic land habitat such as a playground or garden with some common plants (e.g., trees and flowers) and a few animals (e.g., dog, squirrel).",
    "The student can attempt to draw a water habitat like a pond with a mix of plants (e.g., lily pads) and animals (e.g., fish), though details may be inconsistent.",
    "The student can include a few types of living things in each habitat, even if some may not be entirely appropriate (e.g., a tree in a pond)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not clearly distinguish between land and water habitats, leading to animals and plants being misplaced (e.g., duck in a garden).",
    "The student may struggle to show how habitats on land and in water have different sets of plants and animals, potentially mixing species that don't belong together (e.g., frogs in a playground).",
    "The student often lacks the ability to effectively organize or compare the diversity of life, resulting in random placement without clear categorization (e.g., all animals grouped together without regard for habitat)."
