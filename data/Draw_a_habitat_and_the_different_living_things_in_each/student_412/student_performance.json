  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw and label different types of habitats, such as a forest and a pond, clearly showing where plants and animals live.",
    "The student can illustrate and correctly label different living things in each habitat, such as trees, grasses, squirrels, fish, and birds, capturing the ecosystem diversity.",
    "The student can compare and contrast the living things by illustrating different organisms in at least two separate habitats, highlighting their unique adaptations.",
    "The student can identify patterns by clearly indicating one similarity and one difference in plant or animal life between the habitats illustrated, explaining how these differences contribute to the diversity of life."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might occasionally label organisms with vague names like 'bird' instead of specifying a type, but this is infrequent and does not indicate a misunderstanding.",
    "The student might neglect to name one or two specific interactions between organisms, like predator-prey relationships, due to oversight rather than a lack of understanding."
