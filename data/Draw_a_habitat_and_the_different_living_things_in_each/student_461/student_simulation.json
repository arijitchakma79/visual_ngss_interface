  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a habitat with different living things in it. Let's start by drawing the ground. I'll draw a big piece of land and a bit of water next to it. I think putting a big sun in the sky would make it look like the outdoors. Now, I'll add a tree because trees belong outside. I'll add a cloud, too, to make it seem like the sky is nice. Okay, now let's add some fish, but I'm not sure where they should go, so I'll draw them next to the tree. I think I'll add some more trees and maybe a flower here and there. I remember that things live in water so maybe a whale can be there too. This looks like outside, so I hope it's how habitats are supposed to look.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple outdoor scene mixing elements of land and water without clear separation. Include a large yellow sun in the sky, a few fluffy clouds, and a generic green tree standing on a green-colored land area. On the same land area, add a couple of fish and a whale, both with minimal detail, emphasizing a lack of understanding of habitat. Add flowers on the same land. The style should be childlike, using bright, bold colors and simple shapes without specific habitat-geared details or diversity.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing reflects the student's general understanding of an outdoor environment but lacks the ability to distinguish between specific habitats. The student incorporates elements that should be separate, like water and land living things, into a single setting, showing they may not understand where different living things belong. The mixture of aquatic and land elements, as well as the absence of species diversity, demonstrates minimal understanding, as exhibited by the studentâ€™s level description of 'Beginning'."
