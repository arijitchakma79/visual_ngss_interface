  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw random scenery that resembles a general outdoor environment, but not distinguish between specific habitats (e.g., mixing water and land elements together without separation).",
    "Include a few elements that might belong to a habitat, like a cloud or a sun, but not specific living things related to the habitat (e.g., drawing a tree but not understanding it fits in a land habitat)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Correctly identify and draw distinct habitats, like separating a land habitat from a water habitat (student may draw all elements together without understanding habitat differences).",
    "Label the habitats correctly (might write labels like 'land' and 'water' but mix them up or not label at all).",
    "Show an understanding of living things specific to each habitat (e.g., drawing a fish on land or a tree underwater).",
    "Demonstrate patterns or draw a variety of living things specific to each habitat (might repeatedly draw the same element in both habitats or not draw living things at all).",
    "Provide any evidence of diversity within habitats (student may not include different species or types of plants and animals, showing lack of understanding or awareness of biodiversity)."
