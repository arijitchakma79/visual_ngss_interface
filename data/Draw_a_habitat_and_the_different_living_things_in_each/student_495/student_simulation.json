  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a forest because I know some living things that live there. I remember forests have trees, so I’ll draw a bunch of tall trees. I’ll add some bushes too because I think they’re part of forests. I’ll put a squirrel in one of the trees since I know they live there, and maybe a deer on the ground. I’ll add a bird sitting on a branch. Next, I’ll draw a pond. I’ll make sure to draw water with some cattails around it because I remember seeing those by water before. In the pond, I’ll draw a fish because fish live in water. I should also draw a frog on a lily pad. I’ll color the trees green, the pond blue, and the animals in their real colors like brown for squirrels. I won’t draw any ants because I forget if they go in forests or ponds. I know I’m supposed to label things so I’ll label the bird and the frog, but I might label a bush as a tree by accident because I sometimes mix them up.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing showing two habitats: a green forest and a blue pond. The forest has several tall green trees and some smaller bushes. In one tree, there is a brown squirrel, and nearby on the ground is a brown deer. A bird is on a branch. The pond is colored blue, surrounded by green cattails. Inside the pond is a fish, and a frog is on a lily pad. The drawing style is simple with clear and organized placement of living things, but no small insects. Some elements are labeled: 'bird', 'frog', and mistakenly 'tree' for a bush.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict multiple distinct habitats with typical wildlife and plant life found in each, such as trees and squirrels in a forest, and fish and frogs in a pond. It reflects their proficiency by showing organization and effort. However, it also acknowledges their struggle by omitting less obvious species like insects and highlighting potential mistakes in labeling, such as confusing a bush for a tree."
