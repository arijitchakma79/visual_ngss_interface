  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw a habitat. Hmm, I know habitats have trees and animals, so I’ll start with a tree. I'll draw a tree; it’s just a tall stick with green at the top. Next, I’ll add a river. I know rivers look like wavy lines, so I'll just put a wavy line to show the water. Now, I’ll add some animals. I know fish live in the water, so I’ll draw a fish near the river. I’m not sure where to put the bird, so I’ll just draw it on the grass. I think that’s all I remember about habitats. I’m done, I guess.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing a very simple habitat scene. There is a basic, cartoon-like tree with a green oval shape on top of a brown trunk. Below the tree is a single, thick wavy blue line representing a river. A small, simplistic fish is near the river, lacking detail. To the left of the tree, a cartoon-like bird is on the grass. The elements are floating in a generic outdoor setting without specific detail to accurately depict a complete habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing includes a minimal tree and a river with a basic representation of a fish and bird, which aligns with what the student can do. The fish is improperly positioned near the tree instead of in the water, showing the student’s misunderstanding. No detail in showing diverse plant or animal life reveals the student's struggle to show different habitats or organize correctly."
