  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a habitat now. I think of a place where animals live. I'll start with the ground, maybe some grass. Grass is green. I will make a few circles for bushes. Trees should have lines for trunks and big circles for leaves. I remember animals live in places like this. I’ll add a bird flying in the sky. Birds fly, so I think they live everywhere. I remember fish are animals, so I’ll place a fish next to a bush. I might add another circle for a sun, because I see the sun in the sky sometimes. I think that's enough drawing for my habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing of a habitat, with a flat green base representing grass, and a few scattered circles for bushes. Two vertical brown lines with green circles on top represent trees. In the sky, there's a basic shape of a bird made with a 'V' shape, and nearby a rough sketch of the sun as a yellow circle. Next to the bushes, a simple fish shape is drawn, suggesting placement confusion. The drawing is colorful but uses bold, unrefined shapes in a crayon style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw simple shapes for trees and bushes. It reflects their misunderstanding of habitats, as seen with placing a fish out of water, indicating they cannot distinguish between habitat types. The drawing does not have habitat-specific animals besides a general bird in the sky and contains random placement without reference to true biological diversity."
