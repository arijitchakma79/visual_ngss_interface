  "Reasoning": "First, I'll think about the two different habitats I need to draw: a forest land habitat and an ocean water habitat. I remember from the nature walks and videos that forests have lots of trees like pines and maples, with bushes and grasses on the ground. For the forest, I'll also include animals like birds up in the trees, some squirrels, and maybe a deer. There were also insects like butterflies and ants that I saw in the forest. Next, I'll draw the ocean habitat. I'll include different kinds of fish swimming around, a shark, and maybe a dolphin. For plants in the ocean habitat, I'll draw some seaweed and coral because I know they provide shelter to marine life. I’ll use blues for the ocean and lots of greens and browns for the forest. I need to make sure to show the differences between the biodiversity in these habitats. I sometimes forget to label everything, but I’ll try to label most of the plants and animals. I'm also not always sure about the correct size of everything, but I’ll focus on getting the important details. I’ll try to organize my drawing so the differences in the living things are clear.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a split landscape. On the left, illustrate a vibrant forest habitat with tall green pine and maple trees. Include colorful birds perching on branches, a brown squirrel, a graceful deer, and insects like butterflies and ants on the ground. Add green bushes and grasses in the foreground. On the right, depict an ocean scene with various shades of blue. Show diverse fish, a gray shark, and a playful dolphin. Feature green seaweed and colorful coral below the surface. Ensure both habitats show vivid colors and realistic elements with clear biodiversity differences. Leave some plants and animals unlabeled. Use a detailed and organized drawing style suitable for an advanced student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by ensuring both habitats are illustrated with a wide range of plants and animals, representing diversity. The prompt emphasizes the differences between the habitats, aligns with the advanced skill level by indicating a split landscape, and integrates the variety expected of the student. It accounts for the student's potential oversights in labeling and proportional accuracy, ensuring that the essential elements of biodiversity differences are still clearly depicted."
