  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a clear and recognizable habitat scene, accurately choosing either a land or water habitat.",
    "The student can include a variety of living things in their drawing, such as trees, bushes, flowering plants, animals like lizards and squirrels, and water creatures like fish and clams.",
    "The student can demonstrate an understanding of how different types of living things exist in the chosen habitat by grouping them correctly (e.g., water creatures in a pond).",
    "The student can illustrate simple patterns, such as grouping similar types of plants or animals together within the habitat (e.g., fish near plants in the water).",
    "The student can label most of their drawing to identify the different plants and animals shown, with mostly correct identifiers."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit labels for some plants or animals, which can lead to minor confusion about specific identities (e.g., a plant isn't identified, leading to guessing).",
    "The student might not fully illustrate the relationships between living things and their environment (e.g., not showing how animals interact with the plants they live among).",
    "The student may inconsistently show nuanced patterns of habitat use (e.g., grouping isn't fully developed or clear for all species present)."
