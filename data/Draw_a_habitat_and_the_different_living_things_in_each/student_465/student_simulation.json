  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a habitat. Hmm, I think a habitat has trees and water. Let me draw a big circle—that can be a tree. I remember trees are usually green, so I'll color it green. Now I'll draw a wavy line; that looks like water to me, so I'll color it blue. Living things live in habitats too. I’ll draw a flower because that’s one living thing I know. I’ll make it a small circle with some lines around it—it’s pink. Animals belong in habitats too. I should add an animal—I think I'll draw a blob for that. This blob can be a fish, I guess, but I'm putting it next to the tree since I’m not sure where it should go. I don’t really know what animals go in trees or in water. I think that’s enough for my habitat.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration of a simple habitat drawn by a young student. Include a large green circle representing a tree, a wavy blue line representing water, a small pink circle with lines around it to signify a flower, and a vague blob that looks like an animal, placed near the tree. Use basic shapes and bright colors, and ensure the drawing looks like it was done by a young child with a minimal understanding of habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by having basic elements like a tree and water using simple shapes and colors. It includes a limited number of living things like a single flower and an indistinct animal blob, adhering to the student's minimal understanding. The student's lack of specific placement for living things and inability to distinguish different habitat types or show diversity is reflected by placing a fish-like blob incorrectly near a tree and not accurately representing different habitats or distinct living things."
