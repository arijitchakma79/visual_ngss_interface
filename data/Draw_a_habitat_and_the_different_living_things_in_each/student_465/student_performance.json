  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a few basic shapes or elements that resemble parts of a habitat (e.g., a large circle that could be interpreted as a tree or a wavy line for water).",
    "The student might include a very limited number of living things, like a single flower or a blob meant to represent an animal, without clear indication of habitat specificity."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately depict different types of habitats or differentiate between them (e.g., drawing a parking lot might just look like a random scribble).",
    "The student does not show an understanding of specific living things found in each habitat (e.g., may place fish on land or a squirrel underwater).",
    "Comparisons of diversity among habitats will be missing, or incorrect elements might be shown across all habitats without distinction (e.g., the same flowers shown in water and land).",
    "The drawing will lack patterns or any representation of plant and animal diversity (student might not grasp what diversity means)."
