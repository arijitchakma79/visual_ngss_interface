  "Reasoning": "I'm excited to draw different habitats and the living things in each one. I'll start with a forest. In the forest, I know there are tall trees. I'll draw them with different shapes of leaves to show variety. I remember seeing squirrels in trees during recess, so I'll draw a few squirrels climbing the trunks and a bird in a nest. Next, I'll move to a pond habitat. I'll draw water with some lily pads on top. I'll add some fish in the water; they can be different colors to show variety. There should be grasses and maybe some frogs by the edge of the pond. Now, I'll draw a garden habitat with colorful flowers like tulips and roses. I'll add some ants on the soil because I've seen them crawl around the plants. I know each habitat should look different, so I'll make sure the trees, grasses, and animals are different in each one. I might forget to label some things, but I think it's okay because you can see what everything is. I'll try my best to make the sizes right, but a squirrel might end up a bit big.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of three different habitats: first, a lush forest with tall, green trees of various leaf shapes, squirrels climbing the trunks, and a bird in a nest. Second, a serene pond with blue water, green lily pads, colorful fish swimming, and frogs on the grassy banks. Third, a vibrant garden filled with colorful flowers like tulips and roses with ants crawling in the soil. The style is like an advanced elementary student's drawing, showing effort in detail and varied colors, but some elements might lack labels, and there might be slight proportional inaccuracies.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes a variety of habitats and reflects the student's ability to depict different plants and animals accurately for each ecosystem. The prompt incorporates differences in habitat types, acknowledging their biodiversity. Although the drawing might have minor errors like missing labels or uneven sizing, the overall picture still shows the effort and complexity expected from an advanced elementary student's work."
