  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a habitat on land and another in water. I think I'll start with the land habitat. I'll draw a forest first because it's a good example. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw a few tall trees with some branches and leaves. I'll add some grasses at the bottom, and maybe a squirrel on one of the trees because squirrels live in forests. Next, I'll draw a pond for the water habitat. I'll include some fish, but I won't get too detailed â€” just draw general fish shapes because I can't remember specific kinds like trout or bass right now. I should also add some clams because I learned they live in ponds. Now, I'll try to compare them. I know forests usually have more types of plants compared to ponds, so I'll make sure the forest looks like it has a lot of plants. For the pond, I'll keep to a few plants like lily pads. I might not get all the animal types in each, like I know there are lots of insects and birds in a forest, but I'm worried I'll forget to add all of them. I could also try showing which plants are more common, but I'm not sure how to do that without making it look too confusing.",
  "Prompt": "A realistic drawing by a student depicting two habitats: a forest and a pond. The forest has several tall green trees with brown trunks, some green grass, and a small squirrel on one tree. The pond includes generic fish shapes and a few clams, with some lily pads on the water surface. The forest appears dense with vegetation, indicating more plant diversity than the pond, which has fewer plants. The drawing is colorful, using greens, browns, and blues, in a simple, child-like art style with crayon or colored pencil effect.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt aligns with the student's abilities: they can accurately represent a forest and a pond, include some variety of living things, and attempt a basic comparison of plant diversity. However, it also reflects their struggles, like not detailing specific fish types or more complex patterns like population sizes. The child-like art style matches a proficient, but not expert, level of drawing detail."
