  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently show all comparisons of plant and animal diversity (e.g., may overlook the full range of species that could live in each habitat).",
    "The student may partially overlook complex patterns like the relative population sizes of different species within a habitat (student might not notice or depict which species are more abundant).",
    "The student might not label every living thing accurately or might use general labels instead of specific ones (e.g., labeling 'fish' without specifying 'trout' or 'bass')."
