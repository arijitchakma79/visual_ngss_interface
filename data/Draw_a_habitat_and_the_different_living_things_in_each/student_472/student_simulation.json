  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll include tall pine trees and some bushes. I need to add animals too. I think squirrels and deer live in forests, so I’ll draw them as well. Next, I'll draw a water habitat, like a pond. I'll include water lilies and some cattails around it. There should be fish, like a goldfish, and maybe a frog on a lily pad. I should also draw a playground habitat because it's land. I'll add a swing set, grass, and maybe some flowers. Oh, I can draw some birds or insects, like a butterfly, in the playground. I'll make sure each habitat has the right plants and animals. I need to remember to label them all. Sometimes I forget to label, but I'll try to get them all this time. I'll start with the forest, then the pond, and finish with the playground. I have to make sure the sizes look okay, so sometimes I make them too big or small, but I’ll try to get it right.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of three different habitats: On the left, a lush forest with tall green pine trees, dense bushes, a brown squirrel on a branch, and a small deer grazing. In the center, a vibrant blue pond habitat with green cattails, a lily pad with a frog, and an orange goldfish in the water. On the right, a sunny playground with green grass, a yellow swing set, colorful flowers, and a bright butterfly fluttering above. The drawing uses colored pencils and includes labels for each living thing, showcasing the diverse living organisms in each habitat.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the abilities of the student by ensuring there is a variety of habitats depicted accurately with appropriate living things in each. The student can draw detailed and accurate representations of different plants and animals within these habitats, which is reflected in the drawing prompt. The absence of specific scale instructions aligns with the student's potential struggle with maintaining consistency in scale. Additionally, while the student intends to label all elements, they might miss one or two, which is consistent with their potential oversight in labeling."
