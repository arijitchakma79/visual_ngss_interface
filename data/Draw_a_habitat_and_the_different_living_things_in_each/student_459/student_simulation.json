  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw a forest habitat first. I remember forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw a few big ones with green leaves. Maybe I'll add some bushes and grasses around them. Now, I'll draw some living things there, like a squirrel sitting on a branch and maybe a bird flying. Oh, I should add a couple of ants crawling on the ground too. I’ll make sure to label the trees, squirrel, and bird. Next, I’ll draw a pond habitat. Ponds have water, so I'll make an area with blue and draw some ripples. In the pond, I need to add fish; I might draw a couple of different ones, but not too many kinds because I’m not sure what else to add. I’ll put a duck on the water too. I’ll try to remember to label the pond and mention ‘fish’. I know fish usually swim together, so I'll put them close in a group. I hope I don’t forget to label the squirrel and the duck; sometimes I miss those.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a drawing of two habitats on a large piece of paper: A forest and a pond. The forest should have several large green trees with brown trunks, some bushes, and grassy areas. Include a squirrel on a branch and a bird flying overhead. Ants should be shown on the ground. Ensure the trees, squirrel, and bird are labeled. Next, depict a pond with clear blue water and some ripples. In the pond, show a couple of different fish swimming in a group and a duck floating on the water. Labels should be placed on the pond, fish, and duck. The drawing style should be simple and clear, suitable for a young student, with bright and distinctive colors for each element.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes key habitats (forest and pond) and several living things within each, demonstrating effort to show biodiversity with some diversity but not exhaustive. Labeling is emphasized, though it's noted that some might be forgotten, aligning with their level of proficiency and occasional oversight."
