  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw a habitat. First, I remember a pond is a kind of habitat, so I'll draw it. I’ll make a big blue pond because water is blue. Next, I’ll draw some trees around the pond. I know trees are big and have a round top, so I’ll make them green with a brown trunk. Now, I’ll think about animals. Fish live in water, so I’ll draw a couple of fish. They are kind of oval with a tail, but not much detail. I think birds live in trees, so I’ll draw a simple bird sitting on a tree branch. It’s like a small box with wings, nothing too detailed. I think grass should be near the water, so I’ll draw green spikes near the pond. I'm not sure what else lives in a pond habitat, so I'm sticking to what I know. I feel like this looks like a nice place where animals live together.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing of a pond habitat. The scene includes a large blue pond in the center, surrounded by a few simple green trees with brown trunks. There are two simple oval-shaped fish in the water and a basic bird shape sitting on a tree branch. Add some green grass spikes near the edge of the pond. Use bright colors and a simple, naive art style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do, like drawing basic features of a habitat and some common plants and animals. The trees and grass are simple without precise details, and the fish and bird are basic shapes, showing emerging understanding. The prompt avoids diverse or incorrect elements, such as a desert animal in this pond habitat, which aligns with what the student struggles with."
