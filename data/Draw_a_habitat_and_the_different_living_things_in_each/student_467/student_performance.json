  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw different types of habitats, including one land habitat and one water habitat.",
    "The student can illustrate various kinds of living things within each habitat, such as trees, grasses, and common animals like squirrels and fish.",
    "The student can compare and depict a reasonable diversity of plants and animals in the drawings for each habitat.",
    "The student can mostly observe and represent patterns in plant and animal diversity across the different habitats.",
    "The student can plan their drawing by considering how to effectively show and label the different plants and animals, with most labels correct."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle with showing a complete range of biodiversity in more complex habitats (e.g., missing smaller living organisms like ants or clams).",
    "The student may occasionally mislabel some plants or animals (e.g., confusing types of trees or fish).",
    "The student might omit some habitat details that enhance understanding of biodiversity (e.g., pond depth influencing plant placement).",
    "There may be minor gaps in showing more nuanced interdependencies between plants and animals (e.g., missing predator-prey relationships)."
