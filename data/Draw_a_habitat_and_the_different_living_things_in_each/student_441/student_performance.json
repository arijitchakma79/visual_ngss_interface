  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw basic shapes that vaguely resemble elements of a habitat, such as a few scattered trees or a pond. These elements may not be correctly or consistently applied to represent specific habitats.",
    "The student may include simple representations of animals, like blobs with legs or circles with whiskers, without clear distinction between species."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately depict specific habitats such as a forest or pond, showing limited understanding of what defines each habitat (e.g., mixing elements from different habitats inconsistently).",
    "The student may not correctly illustrate various living things, often misplacing them in incorrect habitats (e.g., drawing fish in a forest rather than in a pond or lake).",
    "The student is unlikely to show comparisons of biodiversity across habitats, failing to highlight distinct species diversity or correct plant-animal relationships *(student doesnâ€™t understand habitat-specific diversity)*.",
    "Patterns of biodiversity or variation in plant and animal life across different habitats may not be observed at all or are shown incorrectly, perhaps confusing a single plant type or animal as representative of all habitats."
