  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may be able to draw a basic outline of a habitat, such as land or water, but details are likely minimal.",
    "The student may include a few simple drawings of living things, but they may not be accurately placed in the correct habitat (e.g., drawing a fish alongside trees)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately represent different habitats such as playgrounds or forests separately. The drawing may show a vague and undifferentiated area without distinct features.",
    "There is a misunderstanding in representing different living things in appropriate habitats (e.g., placing squirrels in the water).",
    "The student cannot consistently show comparisons between types of living things in different habitats (e.g., may not understand the difference between animals in different environments).",
    "Patterns of diversity in plants and animals across habitats are not illustrated or understood (e.g., all animals might look similar regardless of the habitat)."
