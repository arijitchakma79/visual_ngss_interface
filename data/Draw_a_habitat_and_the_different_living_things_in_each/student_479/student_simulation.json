  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start with the land habitat. I remember that a forest has trees and animals like squirrels. I'll draw some big, green trees, maybe two or three, and add a squirrel on one. Next, I'll add some flowers and grasses on the ground. For the water habitat, I’ll draw a pond. I know a pond has fish, so I'll draw fish swimming in it. I'll add some lily pads and maybe a frog on one of them. I'll also include a few different plants like reeds around the edge of the pond. I know that there should be a lot of different living things, so I'll try to show that by drawing a bird in the sky above the land and a duck swimming in the pond. I need to show that both habitats have different and similar things. Sometimes I get confused about where animals should go, so I need to be careful not to draw something like a lizard in the pond. I also often forget to label everything correctly, but I'll try my best. I'm aware of the need for diversity, although sometimes I focus on the more common examples and might miss out on the less obvious ones like clams or bushes.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing showing two distinct habitats. On the left, depict a forest with big green trees and a squirrel climbing one, with flowers and grass covering the ground. On the right, show a pond with fish swimming, lily pads, and a frog sitting on one lily pad. Include reeds around the pond. A bird flies in the sky above the forest, and a duck swims in the pond. Use bright colors like green, blue, brown, and appropriate animal colors. The drawing should be in a child-like style with simplified shapes, showing effort appropriate for a proficient 2nd-grade student.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt includes diverse elements like trees, flowers, and common animals such as squirrels and fish correctly placed in their habitats, demonstrating the student's ability to depict distinct habitats with variety. Inclusion of at least one land and one water habitat with living things distinct to each habitat fulfills the 'CAN' criteria. The prompt reflects potential labeling inconsistencies and a tendency to focus on more common species, aligning with the student's areas of struggle."
