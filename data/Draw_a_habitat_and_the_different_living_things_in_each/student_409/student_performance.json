    "The student is unlikely to draw a variety of plants and animals in a chosen land habitat correctly (e.g., may mix features of different plants or animals).",
    "The student may not distinguish between land and water habitats clearly (e.g., may draw fish in the air instead of water).",
    "The student is not expected to label plants and animals accurately (e.g., may label a tree as an animal or not label at all).",
