  "Reasoning": "Okay, first I need to think about what habitat I want to draw. I’ll draw a forest because I remember there should be lots of trees and it's easy to picture. I’ll start by drawing some big trees with leafy tops spread across the page. I remember forests also have different layers, so I’ll draw some bushes beneath the trees and add some grass around those. Now, it’s important to show the diversity in animals. I’ll draw a squirrel climbing one of the trees and a few birds sitting on branches. I think an ant crawling on the ground would be easy to include too. While drawing, I’ll label each of these as 'Squirrel', 'Bird', and 'Ant'. Next, I should try drawing another habitat. A garden will be different from a forest. So I'll draw some flowers, more grass, and maybe a water fountain in the center. In this garden, I’ll add a butterfly near a flower, a bee buzzing around, and maybe label some plants like 'Rose' and 'Daisy'. I’ll try to label these correctly too. I'll draw but might miss some smaller insects, like tiny bugs, because there's already a lot going on. I'll try to show that there are different animals, but I might not connect how they all interact like in a food chain.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of a forest habitat and a garden habitat. In the forest, show large green leafy trees, some bushes, and patches of grass. Include a squirrel on a tree, birds on branches, and an ant near the ground. Label these animals. In the garden picture, show colorful flowers like roses and daisies, a patch of grass, and a small water fountain. Illustrate a butterfly near a flower and a bee flying in the garden. Use a colorful and detailed drawing style to reflect a student's effort at a proficient level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's strengths by including large trees, recognizable animals, and labeled plants and animals in the two habitats. There are attempts to show plant and animal diversity by contrasting a forest with a garden. However, because the student might miss small details, the prompt doesn’t require every possible insect or a detailed interaction like food chains, matching the listed struggles in labeling inconsistencies and incomplete diversity."
