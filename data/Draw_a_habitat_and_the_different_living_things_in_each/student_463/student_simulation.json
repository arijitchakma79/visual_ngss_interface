  "Reasoning": "I need to draw a habitat on land and one in water with different living things in each. I'll start with a land habitat. I remember I can draw a forest, so I’ll include trees like pine trees and some flowers. I want to show birds too. I'll draw a bird on one of the branches and maybe some insects, like butterflies flying around. Now, the water habitat could be a pond. I can put a fish and a frog in it. I'll add some plants too, like lily pads on the water. I remember to keep the fish in the water area. I also want to draw different types of plants, so I’ll add some grasses along the edge of the pond. For the animals, I’ll show a squirrel in the forest and a fish in the pond. I’ll try to label everything, like the trees and the flowers, but I sometimes miss out or spell them wrong. Hmm, I need to be careful about proportions, I’ve messed up the size difference before. I’ll write the labels clearly but might miss one or two.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, child-like drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a forest habitat with tall green pine trees, brightly colored flowers, a bird on a tree branch, and butterflies flying. A small brown squirrel is on the ground. On the right, a pond habitat with blue water containing a single fish, a frog on a lily pad, and some reeds along the pond's edge. Both habitats are labeled: trees, flowers, squirrel, fish, frog, although some labels are missing or slightly misspelled. The proportions are mostly correct, but the fish might be slightly larger compared to the trees.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the elements the student can accurately draw: a forest and pond with correct components (trees, birds, fish, etc.), reflects the student's level of proficiency. The missing or misspelled labels, such as 'lizerd' instead of 'lizard', and some proportion errors (like a fish being too large) match the student's common struggles and mistakes."
