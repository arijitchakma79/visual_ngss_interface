    "The student can draw simple representations of different types of habitats, such as a land habitat with basic elements like trees and a playground, but may lack detail.",
    "The student can illustrate a limited variety of living things found in some habitats, like drawing a few animals such as a squirrel and a fish next to a pond.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to accurately represent a wide diversity of living things in each habitat (e.g., only draws one type of tree or animal).",
    "The student is likely unable to effectively compare the diversity of living things in different habitats (e.g., only shows similar animals in different settings, like squirrels and fish in both land and water habitats).",
    "The student may not identify clear patterns in plant and animal diversity across different habitats (e.g., does not recognize that certain plants or animals are unique to specific habitats)."
