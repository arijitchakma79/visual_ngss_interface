  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a simple habitat. I remember that a forest has trees, so I’ll draw a few trees. I think a couple of bushes should go in the forest too, but that's about it. Next, I'll draw a pond nearby because forests can have ponds. For the living things, I'll add a squirrel in the tree because squirrels live in forests. I know fish live in ponds, so I'll draw a fish in the pond. I want to show grass but I think it looks the same everywhere, so I’ll just draw some under the trees and near the pond. I might draw another animal, but I’m not sure what, so maybe I’ll add a bird. In another part of the picture, I'll draw a beach with sand and water. I know fish live in the water, so I might just draw another fish there, even though it feels similar. I’ll add a palm tree as a different type, even though I don't really know other animals that belong to the beach, I’ll copy the bird near the water too.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing of a forest with a few simple green trees and a blue pond. A squirrel is in one of the trees and a fish is in the pond. The background has a basic beach scene with sand colored in yellow and blue water. There’s a palm tree and the same fish from the pond is in the ocean near the beach. A bird is flying above both the forest and beach scenes. The style is basic and colorful, resembling a second grader's drawing with limited detail and effort visible.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes basic elements of different habitats, such as trees and a pond in a forest, and sand and water for a beach. The student illustrates some living things like a squirrel and a fish but struggles to show a wide variety. The repetition of similar animals, like fish in both water areas, reflects the student’s struggle to differentiate between habitats. The drawing style is simple, matching a second grader’s developing understanding."
