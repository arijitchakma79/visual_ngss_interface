  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I remember that forests have lots of tall trees, so I'll draw a few simple outlines of trees with round tops. I think squirrels live there, so I'll draw a squirrel near a tree. Next, I’ll try a pond. Ponds have water, so I'll draw a big oval for the pond and some wavy lines to show the water. I know fish live in ponds, so I'll draw a simple fish shape in the water. Finally, I’ll try a garden. Gardens have plants, so I'll draw some bushes, but I’m not sure what else should be there. Maybe a butterfly too. I’m going to put the fish, squirrel, and butterfly in all the habitats because I think they can live anywhere. I'm not too good at labeling, so I might skip that. I’ll use colored pencils to add some green for trees and the garden, and blue for water.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of three different habitats: a forest, a pond, and a garden. The forest has simple outlines of trees with round tops and a squirrel. The pond is shown as a big oval with wavy blue lines and a simple fish shape. The garden has a few bushes and a butterfly. The same animals appear in each habitat, not fully accurate to real-life environments. Bright colors like green for trees and garden, blue for water, and brown for the squirrel are used. The drawing style is basic with a focus on the main elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict basic elements like trees and simple animal shapes in each habitat, which they can do. It shows their struggle with plant diversity by only featuring trees and a butterfly without detail in the garden. The repeated animals across different habitats illustrate their misunderstanding of habitat-specific biodiversity. The use of simple shapes and bright colors aligns with their emerging understanding and developing level of detail."
