  "Reasoning": "I remember that a garden is a simple land habitat, so I’ll start by drawing a garden. I'll include a few plants I know, like a tree and some flowers. I know there are usually birds in gardens, so I'll draw a simple bird, maybe like a sparrow. Gardens might also have insects, like a butterfly, so I'll put one in. Okay, I should label them. I think I can label the tree as 'tree' and the bird as 'bird'. I’m not sure how to draw other animals like squirrels or rabbits, or the exact labels for more specific plants, so I'll just stick with what I know. I wish I knew how to make it look like a forest with many different kinds of plants and animals. I’ll color the tree green and brown, the flowers in red and yellow, and the bird maybe a simple blue. I’ll use bright colors because I like that, but keep it simple. I know a pond is a water habitat, like in a garden, so I'll draw a small pond too, with a fish swimming in it, and label it 'fish' because I know that’s what it is. I won’t add many other water creatures because I don't remember what those could be right now.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple garden habitat with a tree and some flowers in bright colors like red and yellow. Include a simple bird perched on a branch, colored blue, and label it 'bird'. Add a butterfly hovering near the flowers. Include a small pond with a single fish swimming, labeled as 'fish'. The scene should be colorful, with green and brown for the tree, simple shapes, and less detail, reflecting a child's drawing. Use a basic illustration style with clear, bold outlines and limited elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's capabilities by focusing on simple land and water habitats, such as a garden with easily recognizable elements. The student can draw basic living things common in the chosen environment, like a tree, bird, and fish. The prompt uses vibrant colors and simple shapes, matching an emerging understanding and basic level of detail. Limiting the number of elements in the prompt demonstrates the student's struggle with depicting diverse organisms and more complex ecosystems."
