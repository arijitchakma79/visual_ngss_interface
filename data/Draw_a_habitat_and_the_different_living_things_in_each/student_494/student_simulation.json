  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a habitat and different living things in each one. I remember seeing playgrounds as habitats because animals like squirrels hang out there. I'll start by drawing a playground with a swing set and some grass. I think squirrels go there, so I'll draw a squirrel near the swings. Squirrels are gray, right? But I can’t really remember how their tails look, so I’ll just give it a big fluffy one. Now, I should try a water habitat. Let’s add a pond on another side. It’s going to be a simple round shape, blue in color because water is blue. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a single orange fish in there. I should add a tree in the playground for the squirrel, but I think it’ll be the same as the plants around the pond. I can't really think of lots of different animals, so maybe I’ll just repeat the squirrels on the grass. Hopefully, this looks like a real habitat picture.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a playground with a few land habitat elements like a swing set and a gray squirrel with a fluffy tail on the grass. The playground has a couple of green trees, which look similar to the bushes near a body of water nearby. On the other side is a basic pond drawn as a blue circle with an orange fish inside. The style is simple, child-like with basic shapes and colors, lacking fine details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the can and cannot do because it includes the key elements the student can depict, like a playground as a land habitat and some basic animals such as squirrels. The student adds a water habitat represented by an oversized pond with a fish which may lack detail, showing the emerging understanding. The prompt avoids including a variety of living things or accurate differences between land and water habitats, highlighting the student's struggle with showing diversity and habitat patterns."
