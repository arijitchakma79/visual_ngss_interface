  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can include a basic land habitat in their drawing, such as a playground or a garden. (The details may be minimal or simple.)",
    "The student can draw some basic animals found in the land habitat, like squirrels or lizards. (These may be simply represented or incorrectly colored.)",
    "The student can show a water habitat by drawing a basic body of water like a pond. (This might be disproportionate in size or featureless.)",
    "The student can draw one or two specific plants or animals in the water habitat, such as a fish. (The types might be correct but lack detail.)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not include more than one type of habitat accurately or miss the water habitat entirely. (E.g., only draws land habitats because they are more familiar.)",
    "The student is likely unable to show a variety of different living things within each habitat. (E.g., might draw only trees or only a single type of animal per habitat.)",
    "The student might fail to depict differences between the types of plants and animals in different habitats. (E.g., drawing the same plants in both land and water habitats.)",
    "The student struggles to demonstrate understanding of patterns common to specific habitats. (E.g., drawing irrelevant or incorrect animals together with unrelated plants like fish in trees.)"
