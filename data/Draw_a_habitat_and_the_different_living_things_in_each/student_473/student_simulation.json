  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw a habitat and some living things that live there. I'll start with a habitat. I remember what a forest looks like, so I'll try to draw that. I'll make some simple shapes to show trees; I think a rectangle with a triangle on top looks like a tree. I'll draw two of those. Now, for the living things. I know there are birds in forests, so I'll draw a basic bird shape, maybe like a sideways 'V' to show it's flying. Hmm, I should add one more thing. People live near forests too, right? I’ll draw a simple person next to the tree, just a circle for the head and lines for the body, arms, and legs. I think that looks okay, even if it's not very detailed. I don't really know what else to add, and I'm not sure how to draw different plants or animals, so I'll just stick with what I have.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple child-like drawing of a forest habitat. The forest has two trees made from rectangles and triangles in green and brown. Include a basic flying bird represented by a sideways 'V' in the sky. Add a very simple stick figure of a person next to one of the trees. Use bright, simple colors and loosely drawn lines to show a beginner’s drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes a basic representation of a land habitat (a forest) with simple tree shapes and basic living things like a bird and a person. The student struggles with showing diversity or distinction between habitats and living things, so the drawing lacks different plant and animal types, accurately representing their understanding level."
