  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",

    "The student may draw a simple representation of a habitat, possibly a recognizable land area (e.g., a rough outline of a garden or forest), but it may lack specific features.",
    "The student might include one or two basic living things, like a tree or a simple animal figure (e.g., a stick figure bird or person), though they might not accurately represent the habitat's biodiversity."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to draw a coherent water habitat (student doesn't distinguish between land and water habitats).",
    "The student cannot illustrate different plant types (student doesn't recognize diversity in plant life).",
    "The student cannot illustrate different animal types relevant to specific habitats (student might place a fish in a forest).",
    "The student does not show how the types of plants and animals differ between habitats (student may draw the same living things in both habitats).",
    "The student is unlikely to demonstrate patterns of biodiversity effectively (student may not understand the concept of biodiversity)."
