  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to fully show a diverse range of plant life accurately in each habitat (e.g., may only draw general or incorrect plant types).",
    "The student might struggle to illustrate and label more than one type of water creature accurately (e.g., might draw fish only and not include other creatures like clams).",
    "The student might misunderstand or oversimplify patterns in the living things between habitats, missing the opportunity to compare and label similarities and differences correctly (e.g., might not see or label the similarity that birds may be in both habitats)."
