  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a habitat and the different living things in each. First, I'll start with a land habitat. I think a forest would be good. I'll draw a big tree and some grass around it. Maybe I'll add another type of plant too, like a flower. Now for animals, I know squirrels live in trees, so I'll draw one on the tree. I think I'll add a bird too, but I'm not sure which type, so I'll just draw a small one in the sky. Next, I need a water habitat. I'll draw a pond with some water. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a big fish there. I can't really think of any other water animals right now though. I'll label the squirrel and fish, but I might forget to label some things correctly. I'm not sure about showing what’s similar or different in these habitats though.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two habitats on one page. On the left, a simple forest with a big green tree, some grass, and a small flower. There is a brown squirrel on the tree, and a small bird in the sky. On the right, a blue pond with one big fish in the water. Both scenes are drawn in a basic, colorful, and slightly uneven style typical of a second grader.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the 'can do' because it includes a basic forest habitat with a tree, grass, and two types of vegetation (flower), along with a squirrel and an attempt to add a bird. The water habitat has a pond with a fish, which matches the student's ability to depict a simple water environment. However, the prompt also reflects 'cannot do' elements, as it doesn't specify additional plants or other water animals like clams, and it doesn’t highlight the understanding of patterns or similarities between habitats beyond what’s drawn."
