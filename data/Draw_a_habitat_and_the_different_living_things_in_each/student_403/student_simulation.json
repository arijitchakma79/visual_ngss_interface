  "Reasoning": "I need to draw some habitats with the living things inside them. First, I'll start with a forest. I'll draw tall trees, maybe with brown trunks and green leaves. I know squirrels live in forests, so I'll draw a small squirrel on one of the tree branches. I might also add some grass around the trees. Next, I'll draw a pond. A pond needs water, so I'll color a blue area for the water. Fish live in water, so I'll draw a few fish swimming. Maybe I'll add some lily pads too. For the garden, I'll draw flowers like tulips, which Iâ€™ll color in red and some green plants around. I can add an ant here because they often live in gardens. One thing to remember is not to mix up where I put the animals, so I should keep the fish in the pond. Sometimes I find it hard to make the garden and forest look really different, so I'll try but it might not be perfect. I also often forget to label everything, but I'll try to remember and at least label some of the animals and plants.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing showcasing three different habitats. First, a forest with tall brown trees with green leaves, a squirrel on one of the branches, and patches of green grass. Second, a pond filled with blue water, a few fish swimming in it, and some green lily pads on the surface. Third, a garden with red tulips and other green plants, featuring an ant. The drawing style should be a simple crayon or colored pencil style typical of a school project for young students, with some labels like 'squirrel,' 'fish,' and 'tulip' near the relevant drawings. Bright and clear colors to indicate a lively setting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes elements that the student can draw, such as different habitats with correct plants and animals typical for each environment. The forest has trees and a squirrel; the pond contains fish and lily pads. The garden includes ants and tulips. These align with the student's ability to illustrate recognizable habitats and living things. The prompt hints at potential challenges, like minor inaccuracies in illustrating distinct differences between the forest and garden or missing some labels, capturing the 'cannot do' aspects."
