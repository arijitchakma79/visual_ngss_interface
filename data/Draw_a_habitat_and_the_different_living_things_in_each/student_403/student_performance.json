  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw different habitats on land and in water, such as a forest, garden, and pond, with recognizable features for each (e.g., trees in a forest, water body for a pond).",
    "The student can illustrate various plants in each habitat, such as trees, flowers, and grasses, and generally place them in appropriate settings (e.g., aquatic plants in the pond).",
    "The student can draw different animals in each habitat, such as lizards, squirrels, fish, and ants, with moderate accuracy in terms of habitat compatibility.",
    "The student can show some differences between living things in different habitats by comparing their drawings (e.g., noting that fish are in water habitat, while squirrels are on land).",
    "The student can use the drawings to highlight some patterns like common plants or animals found in specific habitats (e.g., fish in a pond, trees in a forest)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently depict detailed differences between habitats (e.g., they might draw a garden too similarly to a forest, without clear distinction).",
    "The student could struggle to accurately illustrate the more subtle or less common patterns in habitats (e.g., not showing the diversity of plants within the forest habitat).",
    "There could be minor inaccuracies in animal-plant interaction illustrations (e.g., placing aquatic animals in a terrestrial context, illustrating fish on land).",
    "The student may have minor issues with labeling all elements or consistently showcasing every required aspect of each habitat (e.g., missing labels on a few plants or animals)."
