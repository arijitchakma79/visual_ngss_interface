  "Reasoning": "Hmm, I've got to draw a habitat with different living things in it. I think I'll choose a simple forest habitat because that's something I've seen at the park. I'll start by sketching the outline of the forest. I'll draw a few trees with big, round tops and some trunks. I remember that squirrels like to live in trees, so I'll try to draw a squirrel on a tree branch. I can also add a bird flying above the trees, and maybe an ant on the ground. I know flowers grow in forests too, so I'll draw a couple of flowers near the trees. I'll make sure to draw more than one tree so it looks like a real forest. I don't think I'm supposed to draw a pond or a stream because I’m not sure what plants or animals live there. Let's see, labeling… I’ll write 'tree' near one of the trees, and 'squirrel' near the squirrel, but I'm not really sure about labeling the other things. I hope this looks good as a basic forest habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A child's simple drawing of a forest habitat. There are several trees with round, green tops, and brown trunks. A squirrel is sitting on one of the branches, and a bird is flying above the trees. Near the base of the trees, there are small, colorful flowers and an ant on the ground. The drawing is done in a simple, colorful crayon style with basic shapes and solid colors, typical of a young student's work.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches what the student can do by focusing on a land-based habitat with trees, a squirrel, a bird, and an ant. It includes more than one tree to show patterns, aligns with the student's ability to depict basic elements, and keeps to living things the student is familiar with. It avoids water habitats, complex ecosystems, and in-depth labeling, reflecting the student's struggles and emerging understanding."
