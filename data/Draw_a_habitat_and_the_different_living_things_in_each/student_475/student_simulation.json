  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big sheet of paper divided into two sections. On the left side, I'll draw a land habitat. I think a forest has recognizable features like tall trees and bushes, so I'll draw a few trees with some bushes around them. Let's add a squirrel climbing a tree because squirrels live in forests. In this section, I'll also put a small playground with swings, but no animals there cause animals like squirrels are more forest-like. On the right side, I'll draw a water habitat. I know ponds are a type of water habitat, so I'll draw a pond with some plants around the edges. I remember from a field trip that fish live in ponds, so I'll add fish in the water. Might put some frogs near the edge, jumping. I think I'll add a stream next to the pond since streams are watery too. I struggle with adding more unusual things, like small insects or special flowering plants. I don't really know which plants are specifically better for forests or why, so I'll just stick with what I know: trees in forests and water plants near ponds. And for the water, I'll color it a nice blue, the forest is green with brown tree trunks, and a colorful brown squirrel in the tree. I'll use bright colors for the playground.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing divided into two sections. The left side shows a forest habitat with tall green trees, brown trunks, and bushes. A squirrel is climbing a tree. There's a small colorful playground with swings. The right section shows a water habitat with a blue pond and a stream with some fish swimming in it. Frogs sit near the edge of the pond. The entire drawing uses bright, vibrant colors and a simple, child-like style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities. They can depict basic land and water habitats with recognizable elements like trees, bushes, ponds, and streams. The student includes common living things, such as squirrels and fish, appropriately placed in their respective habitats. However, the student does not include less common elements like specific flowering plants or insects, and they might not fully understand niche adaptations or plant suitability to different environments, which is reflected in the absence of specific or diverse flora."
