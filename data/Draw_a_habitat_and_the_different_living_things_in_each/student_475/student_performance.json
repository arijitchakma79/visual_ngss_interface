  "CANNOT": [
    "Inconsistently use their drawing to show clear patterns in how different plants and animals live in different habitats (e.g., student might struggle with distinguishing why a plant is better suited to a forest compared to a garden).",
    "Might overlook less common ecosystem elements, such as specific flowering plants or small insects, resulting in less diversity in the drawing (student focuses on larger, more obvious living things)."
