  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a couple of habitats. I remember there's a garden habitat, so I'll start with that. I'll draw some simple flowers and trees, and maybe a bush. Next to the garden, I want to draw a pond habitat. I'll try to include some fish in the pond and maybe a lily pad. I remember frogs like ponds too, so I'll put a frog near the water. I know there are animals in these habitats, but I'm not really sure of their specific names. I'll just draw some animals like birds flying above and some generic animals in the garden like a 'small animal’ and 'big animal'. I’m a bit confused about what should be in which habitat, so I might just mix a few things and call a flower a bush or something. I'll try to make sure the things I draw look different from each other so there's some variety. I think I’ll draw a nest but I hope I'm putting it in the right spot. Okay, let me start drawing.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of a nature scene showing a garden and a pond habitat. In the garden, include simple flowers, a few trees, and a bush, but use basic shapes and colors like green for trees and pink for flowers. Near the pond, draw fish and a frog by the lily pad. Add a few animals around the garden and pond, like 'small animal' and 'big animal', without detailed labels. Birds are flying in the sky. Use crayons or colored pencils in a childlike, simple style with bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and partially label habitats, showing some plants and animals with basic details. It includes examples of things the student can illustrate (e.g., pond with fish, trees in the garden) and mixes labels or uses incorrect terms. The lack of detailed labeling and some mixing of elements in habitats (like a nest or mislabeling a flower as a bush) aligns with the student's struggles according to the 'CANNOT' criteria."
