  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start by drawing a forest habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw tall trees with green leaves and brown trunks. I'll add some smaller bushes and maybe some flowers near the ground because I know plants can differ in size. Now, for the animals: I’ll draw a squirrel climbing a tree since I've seen pictures of them doing that. In the bushes, I'll put a little lizard basking in the sun and some ants on the ground. For variety, I'll draw a bird flying above the trees. Next, I'll draw a different habitat, like a pond. I'll make the water blue and add some lily pads and cattails since they belong in pond environments. In the water, I'll draw a fish and maybe a frog sitting on a lily pad. I know clams can be in ponds too, so I'll add one at the bottom. I want to show how different these two habitats are, so I'll make sure the plants and animals don't repeat. I’ll label most of these, though I might forget the names of some of them, like the specific type of fish. I hope I don't make a mistake like adding a marine fish here. I want to show some interactions too, like a bird catching an insect. Labels will show what each thing is.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed illustration showing two distinct habitats: a forest on the left and a pond on the right. The forest includes various green trees with brown trunks, small bushes, and flowering plants. Animals include a squirrel climbing a tree, a lizard basking on a bush, ants on the ground, and a bird flying overhead. The pond features blue water with lily pads, cattails, and animals like a fish swimming underwater, a clam resting at the pond's bottom, and a frog on a lily pad. The drawing is vibrant and colorful, using greens and browns for the forest, and blues and greens for the pond. Interaction, like a bird catching an insect, is shown. Labels are scattered throughout, identifying most plants and animals, with some omissions or incorrect placements. The style is youthful but detailed, focused on variety in plants and animals.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by depicting a wide variety of plants and animals appropriate for each habitat, using labels, and showing interactions. It also aligns with the student's challenges by indicating potential mismatches in labeling and organism placement in habitats. The drawing reflects an advanced level effort with a comprehensive representation."
