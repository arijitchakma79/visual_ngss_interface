  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat. I remember that forests have lots of trees, so I'll draw a few tall trees and add branches and leaves. I'll label them as 'trees'. In the forest, there are animals like squirrels, so I'll draw a couple of them on the branches and label them 'squirrels'. I'll also add a rabbit on the forest floor and label it. Now, I'll switch to a pond habitat. Ponds have water, so I'll draw a big blue area and label it 'pond'. There are fish in ponds, so I'll draw a few fish in the water and label them. I remember there are also plants in ponds, I'll sketch some lily pads or other water plants and label them. I'll try to compare these habitats, although I might put more animals in the forest. I might not show many differences clearly, but I'll make sure to show animals in both places.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a scene with two habitats for a school project. On the left, depict a forest with several tall green trees. Add squirrels on the branches and a rabbit on the ground, both labeled. On the right, create a pond habitat with a blue pond, illustrating fish swimming in the water, and add some green lily pads on the surface, with labels. Use a colorful, child-like drawing style to show the habitats and animals clearly.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt includes the accurate elements the student can draw, such as labeled trees, squirrels, and a rabbit for the forest, and a pond with fish and aquatic plants. The prompt reflects the student's potential struggle by showing more emphasis on one habitat (forest) without a detailed comparison of variety. It suggests a colorful, child-like style appropriate for the grade level and the proficient description."
