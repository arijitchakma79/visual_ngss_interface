  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label at least one habitat clearly, such as a garden or a pond.",
    "The student can include and label a few living things like a tree and a bird in a land habitat, and maybe a fish in a water habitat.",
    "The drawing might show one comparison, possibly with an animal that can be found in both habitats, like a bird. (e.g., labeled in the sky or on a branch above both habitats)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to draw two distinct habitats with all necessary components. (e.g., might miss a water habitat entirely or not differentiate them clearly).",
    "The student may show limited diversity of living things, possibly missing key components like bushes, grasses, or small animals, in one or both habitats.",
    "The student might misunderstand the task of illustrating unique living things per habitat, and not depict or incorrectly label such differences. (e.g., shows the same tree or fish in both habitats)",
    "The student may not consistently organize or label elements clearly, leading to a confusing representation of diversity. (e.g., overlapping drawings without distinctions)"
