  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a habitat. I think I’m going to draw a garden because I know it has plants and some animals. I’ll draw a big tree with green leaves in the middle, and maybe put a bird on one of the branches. Below the tree, I’ll add some flowers because I know these are in gardens. I'll try to draw a butterfly next to the flowers because butterflies like flowers. Okay, now I should think about another habitat... a pond! Ponds have water, so I’ll draw a blue circle for the pond. I remember there are fish in ponds, so I’ll draw a simple fish in the water. But, I’m not so sure what else goes in the pond; I'll just make sure the fish is there. For comparison, maybe I can draw the bird again, in the sky above both the garden and the pond, but I'll try not to add the same tree or fish in both places. I don’t really know what small animals go in the garden, and I guess I forgot about things like bushes or different grasses. I’m not very good at making them distinct, but I think it'll be okay if I just focus on a couple of things clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two habitats: a garden and a pond. In the center of the garden habitat, there’s a large tree with green leaves and a bird perched on a branch. Below, colorful flowers are present with a butterfly nearby. The pond habitat features a simple blue circle representing water with a single fish inside. The bird is also depicted flying in the sky above both habitats. The drawing is in a simple, colorful, and slightly messy style typical of a developing artist, with an emphasis on the basic elements but few details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label at least one habitat clearly by depicting a garden with a tree and flowers, as well as a pond with a fish. The inclusion of a bird in both habitats satisfies the task of showing some comparison element. However, the drawing lacks differentiation between habitats, missing diverse components such as bushes or small animals as per the student's limitations. The style is simple and colorful, consistent with the students' emerging understanding at Level 2."
