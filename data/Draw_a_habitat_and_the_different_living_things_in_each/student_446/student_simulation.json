  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a garden because that's a land habitat I see often. I'll start by drawing the ground with some grass. I'll add a couple of trees, even though I'm not quite sure how to make them look different. I'll draw them with a round, green top and a brown trunk. Next, I'll include a squirrel because I saw one in the garden once. I'll make the squirrel small, with a bushy tail. Next, I'll draw an ant crawling on the grass because I see a lot of ants around. For a water habitat, I'll draw a simple pond next to the garden. I'll make it blue to show it's water and add a fish because fish live in ponds. The fish will be small and orange. I think I'll leave it at that because I'm not sure about any other animals or plants to include.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a garden habitat showing grass, two round green trees, a small squirrel with a bushy tail, and an ant on the grass. Next to the garden, show a simple pond with blue water and a small orange fish. Use bright colors and a crayon drawing style appropriate for a young student. The drawing should feel simple and elementary, with limited detail and a focus on a small number of living things.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it focuses on a basic land habitat (garden) and includes basic elements the student can identify, like grass and a couple of trees. The prompt includes only one or two animals, such as a squirrel and an ant, consistent with the student's ability. It also describes a simple pond with limited detail, featuring a single fish, aligning with what the student can draw. It avoids detailing a variety of habitats or a wide range of living things, which the student struggles with, ensuring realism in the depiction of the student's understanding level."
