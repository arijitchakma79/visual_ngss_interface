  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw a habitat and the living things in it. I’ll start by choosing a habitat. Let’s pick a forest because I think forests have a lot of different plants and animals. First, I’ll draw a couple of big trees because I know that’s where many animals live. I’ll make the trees green with brown trunks. Next, I’ll add some animals like a bird and a squirrel because they live in trees. I remember that birds can be blue, like blue jays. I’ll make a squirrel gray. I know that some forests have deer, so I’ll draw a deer too. There’s a river in some forests, so I’ll draw a blue stream. I’ll add a fish in the river because fish live in water. I’m not sure what else lives in a forest, so I’ll put some grassy areas and maybe some flowers. Flowers can be yellow or red, I think. I’m not sure which animals belong only to forests, but that’s okay. Some parts might look random because I’m not sure about where to put everything or why they live there.",
  "Prompt": "Drawing of a forest habitat. Include a couple of large green trees with brown trunks, a blue bird on one of the branches, a gray squirrel on another tree. Draw a brown deer standing near the trees. Add a winding blue river with one fish swimming in it. Include areas of grass and scatter a few yellow and red flowers. Use basic colors and a simple, childlike drawing style with minimal details and labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s ability to identify and illustrate a forest habitat on land, with a basic understanding by showing trees and some animals, such as a bird and a deer. The student includes at least three types of living things, consistent with their developing level. However, the drawing might seem unorganized and lack specific labeling or details because the student struggles with understanding spatial relationships, abundance patterns, and lacks comprehensive labeling of habitat-specific organisms."
