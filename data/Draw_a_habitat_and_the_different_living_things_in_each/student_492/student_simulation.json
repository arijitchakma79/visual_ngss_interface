  "Reasoning": "First, I'll think about different types of habitats. I can draw a forest, a pond, and a garden since those all have different plants and animals. I'll start with the forest. In the forest, I’ll draw tall trees like oaks because they are common in forests. I'll add some bushes and grasses too. Next, I'll draw animals like squirrels climbing the trees and ants on the ground. I might draw a lizard on a rock too. I need to remember to label everything, though sometimes I forget one or two labels, like a certain plant or animal, if I get too focused on the details. Now for the pond. I’ll draw water with some fish swimming, and clams on the bottom. I'll add plants that live in water, like water lilies. On the edge, I'll draw reeds and a frog sitting on one. For the garden, I'll draw flowering plants like roses and daisies, with some bees flying around because they pollinate the flowers. I’ll also draw a small bird sitting on a branch or bush. I’ll use different colors for each plant and animal because that makes it look more real. In each habitat, I’ll compare the animals and plants I included. Like, both the forest and garden have birds, but they might be different kinds. I need to keep track of the patterns of which animals live where and make sure my drawings show those relationships clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed children's drawing showing three distinct habitats: a forest, a pond, and a garden. In the forest, tall green oak trees with brown trunks, green bushes, and patches of grass. Squirrels on tree branches, a lizard on a rock, and ants on the ground. Labels for each plant and animal. The pond features a blue water surface with fish swimming and clams at the bottom, along with water lilies on the surface. At the edge of the pond, reeds and a frog are perched on one. The garden is filled with colorful flowers like red roses and yellow daisies, with flying bees, and small birds on branches. Each element is illustratively labeled. Show vibrant, playful colors indicative of a child's drawing, with slight variations in detail intensity across elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student’s ability to accurately and detailedly draw and label a variety of habitats with distinct organisms. It also reflects their capability to exhibit the relationships between habitats and organisms using a vibrant, child-appropriate style. The inclusion of mostly common examples addresses their ability to identify patterns, while the mixed detail level illustrates occasional lapses in uniform detail or labeling accuracy."
