  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big area for the habitat. I think I'll make it all water because I remember ponds can have animals. I will draw a big blue oval. Now, I should add something that lives there. I'll draw a fish because fish live in water. I'll make it a simple shape, like a smiley face with a tail, but I’m not sure what color. Maybe it’s just blue too, since it’s in the water. I think ponds have plants, but I’m not sure what kind, so I’ll draw something green in the water, like a blob. I remember trees and animals, but I don’t know where they go exactly, so I'll add a tree near the water. I’ll make it a circle on a stick, because trees have leaves. Maybe I’ll put the same fish near the tree, since I’m not sure what fish eat or live with, and I don't know what else to add.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a habitat showing a large blue oval representing water. Inside the water is a simple blue fish, shaped like a smiley face with a curved tail. Nearby is a blob-like green shape representing an underwater plant. Next to the water is a generic tree, drawn as a green circle on a brown stick. The style is primitive and minimal, with simple shapes and uniform colors, showing no detailed features or distinctions between habitat elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes a primitive outline of a single water habitat with a generic fish and an undefined green shape for a plant, which aligns with their ability to draw basic elements without detail. It also matches what they cannot do because it lacks multiple habitat types, diversity of organisms, correct labelings, detailed depictions, and logical relationships, showing the student's minimal understanding."
