  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big area and divide it into two parts to show different habitats. I'll start with a pond on one side because I think ponds are cool and I remember seeing fish in ponds. I’ll draw a big blue circle for water to show the pond and put a fish inside it. Then I'll add green grass around the pond. I remember frogs like ponds too, so I will add a frog next to the water. On the other side, I’ll draw a garden. I know there's usually grass, so I'll put some at the bottom for the ground. I should also add a tree because I’ve seen gardens with trees before. I’ll draw a tree with a brown trunk and some green leaves. Next to it, I’ll put a squirrel on the grass because I know squirrels like being around trees. I think I’ll draw a flower because gardens have flowers, but I'm not sure which type. I’m putting a few big ones because they’re easy to draw. I don't really know how to show different types of plants or animals, so I’ll stop here.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing of two different habitats: a pond and a garden. On one side, illustrate a pond with a large blue circle for water, a simplistic fish inside, and a basic green grassy area around it. Add a simple frog, colored green, next to the pond. On the other side, depict a garden with a flat green area to represent grass and a simple brown-trunked, green-leaved tree. Place a basic representation of a squirrel on the grass near the tree. Add a few large flowers, in bright colors, near the tree. The overall style should be simple, without detailed elements, in bright, primary colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a basic representation of a pond and a garden with simple elements like grass, water, fish, and a few animals and plants. It reflects their ability to show some elements of the habitats but not a wide variety. The drawing lacks diversity in the plant and animal life and doesn't draw connections between specific plants and animals within the habitat, aligning with the student's struggles and misunderstandings as described."
