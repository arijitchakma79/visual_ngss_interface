  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw two habitats: a forest and a pond. For the forest, I'll start by drawing some tall trees with green leaves. I remember there are animals like birds, squirrels, and rabbits, so I'll add them too. The birds will be perched in the trees, the squirrels on branches, and the rabbits on the ground. I'll also include some bushes and flowers to show the diversity of plants. For the pond, I'll draw water with a few fish swimming and frogs sitting on lily pads. I'll add some reeds growing in the shallow water. To show the habitat properly, I think ducks or a turtle would be good, so I'll put a turtle basking on a rock and ducks floating on the water. I have to make sure I give each animal and plant their correct features, like the turtle's shell or the different colors of the fish. I'll also include details like the texture of the tree bark and the patterns on the feathers of the birds. Lastly, I'll use colored pencils to bring everything to life, using green for the leaves, brown for the tree trunks, blue for the water, and various colors for the animals. I need to label each plant and animal, though sometimes I forget small things, like labeling every single plant or some small insects.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a detailed illustration of two distinct habitats. The first habitat is a lush green forest with tall trees, green leaves, bushes, and various flowers. Include animals like colorful birds perched on branches, gray squirrels climbing the trees, and brown rabbits on the forest floor. The second habitat is a vibrant pond scene with clear blue water and green lily pads. Display fish swimming, frogs on lily pads, a turtle basking on a rock, and ducks floating on the water. Add reeds along the pond's edges. Use colored pencils for a realistic and detailed representation, capturing textures like rough tree bark, detailed bird feathers, and smooth, shiny fish scales. Ensure a vibrant mix of greens, browns, blues, and a variety of colors for the animals. The style should be realistic, showing careful attention to details and textures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt encompasses the student's abilities to accurately and vividly illustrate diverse habitats, including the correct depiction of a variety of plants and animals, reflecting the student's advanced capability. It includes the minute features and vibrant colors the student can create, capturing key habitat differences and organismal diversity. It also leaves room for potential minor omissions, such as limited labeling, that don't detract from the drawing's overall accuracy and completeness."
