  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm supposed to draw a habitat and the different living things in it. I remember there's a forest and a pond. I'll start with the forest. Let's draw a big tree. I think that's what forests have, like the giant ones I've seen before. Oh, and a bush next to it. But that's all I remember for forests. Now the pond. Ponds have fish, so I'll draw a big fish with big fins swimming in the water. Should I add anything else? Maybe I can draw a duck on top of the water. Hmm, my pond is really close to my tree. Are forests and ponds really next to each other? I'm not sure, but I'll draw them together anyway since I think both need water. I can't really think of many living things besides the tree, the fish, and the duck. I want my drawing to look nice, but there aren't many things to add. Aren't there like bears in forests too? But I don't know how to draw a bear, so I won't. I'll color the tree brown and green for leaves, blue for the water, and silver for the fish.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene combining elements of a forest and a pond. The forest side should have a single large tree with green leaves and a nearby bush. The pond area should have a large fish with pronounced fins swimming in blue water and a duck floating on the surface. The forest and pond are very close to each other with minimal separation, suggesting merging characteristics. Use vibrant colors like green for the leaves, brown for the tree trunk, blue for the water, and silver for the fish, with a simple child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's limited understanding by focusing on a single forest and pond habitat, showing only a few common and easily recognizable living things within each habitat. It describes a lack of diversity and incorrect merging of habitats, reflecting the student's struggle to differentiate and organize them accurately, consistent with their level description and grade."
