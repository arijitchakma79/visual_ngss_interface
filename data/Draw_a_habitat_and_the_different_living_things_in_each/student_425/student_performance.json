  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a single type of habitat, like a forest or a pond, but with limited detail.",
    "The student might include a few living things within the habitat, such as a tree or a fish, but they could be simplistic or inaccurately represented."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to depict different types of habitats accurately (e.g., may merge characteristics of land and water habitats).",
    "The student may not illustrate a variety of living things found in each habitat, potentially focusing on only one or two examples without diversity.",
    "The student probably won't compare different habitats in their drawing, failing to show unique living things associated with each habitat.",
    "The student might not identify or describe any patterns of plant and animal diversity, possibly showing unrelated items together.",
    "The student may struggle to organize their drawing to clearly convey where specific plants and animals are observed in the habitat, leading to a jumble of unrelated elements."
