  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a habitat. I remember that a pond is a type of habitat I’ve learned about. So, I’ll draw a big circle and fill it with blue to show the water for my pond. I think there should be a fish in the pond, so I’ll draw a simple fish shape and color it orange. I know there are plants around ponds too, but I can’t really recall their specific shapes, so I’ll just draw a few green bumpy lines and label them as 'plant'. Next, I’ll try to draw another habitat, maybe a garden. I’m not sure how to make it look different from the pond except for not having water, so I’ll just draw some of the same green plants and maybe a couple of red circles to be flowers. For animals, I think I’ll add a bird in this garden habitat, like a little 'V' shape for the bird, but I’m a bit confused about where else to place the animals or how they are different in each place. I know that I’m supposed to show different plants and animals in different habitats, but it’s a little tough to think of things that are not the same between the two, so I ended up drawing a fish for both, thinking of them as the same type of animal.",
  "Prompt": "A child's crayon drawing of two habitats. The first habitat is a pond, represented by a blue circle with an orange fish inside. Around the pond are a few green squiggly lines labeled 'plant'. The second habitat is a garden, drawn with the same green squiggly lines and a few red circles for flowers. A simplistic bird, drawn in a 'V' shape, is added to this habitat. The drawing style is simple and childlike, with bright, primary colors and basic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's developing level by showing an ability to identify and draw a specific habitat, such as a pond with water and a fish, but also demonstrates some confusion and simplicity in representing different plants and animals. The repeated elements and lack of distinct labeling between the habitats highlight the student's struggle with distinguishing biodiversity and understanding adaptations within each habitat."
