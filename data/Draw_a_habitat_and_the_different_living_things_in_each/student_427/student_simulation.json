  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a garden habitat on one side. I remember gardens usually have grass and trees, so I’ll start with those. The trees go together in one section, and I’ll add birds sitting on the branches. I’ll also add some flowers. I need to label these, so I’ll write 'tree', 'bird', and 'flowers.' Oh, I forgot the grass label. Now I'll draw a pond habitat next to it. I know ponds have water, so under the water, I’ll draw fish and maybe a frog sitting on a lily pad. I’ll add some insects above the pond like dragonflies, and there are usually ducks, but where should they go? I’ll put them on the water for now, even though ducks might also be on land sometimes. I shouldn’t mix up desert plants like cacti since they don’t go in these habitats. I might forget to label all the plants, but I’ll try to remember most. I’ll add some color: green for trees and grass, blue for water, and bright for flowers and birds. After labeling, I think a label or two might end up missing because I always miss some.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing of two habitats side by side. On the left, a garden with green grass, a few grouped trees with brown trunks and green leaves, brightly colored flowers, and birds in the trees. Some of these elements are labeled. On the right, a pond with blue water, fish in the water, a frog on a lily pad, and insects like dragonflies above. A duck is in the water. The drawing is colorful, with an effort in labeling, but not every plant or animal is labeled. The style is simple and typical for elementary students, using vibrant crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency in drawing and labeling two distinct habitats, reflecting their understanding of diversity and organization. While the student can include and label most of the diverse elements correctly, the struggle with missing labels and minor habitat inaccuracies, like placing a duck without distinguishing its dual habitat, is evident. The drawing style and colors align with the level of understanding and detail a proficient student at this grade would demonstrate."
