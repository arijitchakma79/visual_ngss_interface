  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a habitat. I think a garden would be a good choice because gardens have grass and sometimes flowers. First, I'll draw the ground by making a green patch with some brown lines to show dirt. Then, I'll draw a big tree with a simple circle for the top and a straight brown line for the trunk. For living things, I'll draw a flower using a circle in the middle and some petals around it. Maybe I can add a bug too, but I'm not sure exactly how it's supposed to look, so I'll just make a small oval to represent it. I don't really know how to show different habitats, so this is my one garden. I'm not sure how animals fit into the scene, like if I should put a fish here, but that doesn't sound right in a garden. I wish I could think of different places and animals, but I'll stick with these simple shapes in my garden.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a child-like representation of a garden habitat. The drawing should have a green ground with brown lines to indicate dirt. Include a simple green tree with a round top and a brown trunk. Add a simple flower with a circle center and flat petals. Next to the flower, place a small oval to represent a bug. Use bright, primary colors and keep the style simplistic and cartoonish, reflecting a beginner's understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the limited understanding of a beginner student by depicting a single type of habitat (a garden) using very basic shapes. It includes only a few generic living things—a flower and an indistinct bug—without any details or accurate placement of biodiversity. The focus on simplistic and cartoonish design aligns with their capacity to represent things with minimal understanding of the relationships or diversity within habitats."
