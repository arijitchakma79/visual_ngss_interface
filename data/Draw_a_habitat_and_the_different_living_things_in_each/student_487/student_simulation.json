  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a habitat. I think I'll draw a pond because I remember seeing fish and plants in ponds. I'll start by drawing the outline of a pond in the middle of the page. I'll make it kind of wavy to look like water. I'll add some fish in the water; I'll draw a big fish and a few small ones. Now, I remember there are plants in ponds too, like lily pads. I'll draw some round lily pads with little flowers on top. On the edges of the pond, I'll add some tall grasses, since I know plants grow around ponds too. I'll also include a frog sitting on one of the lily pads and a dragonfly flying above. Because I like it when there's lots of life, I'll draw a bird perched on a branch above the pond. I should try to show a few different plants, so I'll add a small bush next to the pond. It looks good, but I didn't think to draw any snails or underwater plants, and I didn't label anything, which maybe I should have done. I hope it's okay that I'm not showing another habitat, like a land one next to the pond.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a pond habitat with a wavy blue outline representing water. In the pond, there are colorful fish, some large and some small, swimming. Circular green lily pads with pink flowers are floating on the water. On one lily pad, a green frog is sitting. Tall grasses, colored green, grow at the pond's edge. Above the pond, a blue dragonfly hovers. A brown bird is perched on a branch above the pond. A small green bush is drawn beside the pond. The drawing style is simple and colorful, resembling a child's interpretation with crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches the studentâ€™s proficiency level by showing a clear illustration of a pond habitat, including relevant environmental features and a variety of species found in that habitat like fish and lily pads. There are several distinct types of plants and animals depicted, like the frog, dragonfly, and bird, demonstrating an effort to show diversity. However, minor gaps remain, such as the omission of clams or snails and a lack of labels, highlighting what the student typically struggles with."
