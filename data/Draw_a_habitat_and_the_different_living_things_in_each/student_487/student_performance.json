  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently differentiate between habitats if more than one is shown (e.g., similar plants depicted in both land and water habitats).",
    "The student might show minor gaps in illustrating the diversity of life or could omit less common species (e.g., fails to show clams in pond habitat).",
    "The student may struggle to fully demonstrate patterns of similarity and difference across habitats (e.g., similar types of animals not shown distinctly).",
    "The student might not clearly label all plant and animal types, leading to partial representation (e.g., a bush depicted but not labeled)."
