  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a garden habitat. I'll include big sunflowers because I remember seeing those in a neighbor's garden. I'll draw a few bees buzzing around them and label them, though I might forget to name the specific sunflower variety. Next, I'll move to drawing a pond habitat. I'll start with some waterlilies and try to draw fish underneath. I'm pretty sure fish should be in ponds, but I might confuse which type, so I'll just call them 'fish'. I know frogs are often near ponds, so I'll draw one on a lily pad. For a forest habitat, I’ll draw tall trees like oaks and add a squirrel on one branch. I’ll probably forget to label the oak tree. I'll draw some mushrooms on the ground but might not know their exact type. While drawing, I'll think about how squirrels are in forests and frogs in ponds, but I might not identify less obvious patterns. I'll try to add some sun and clouds for realism, like what I've seen in photos, but I might add an unrealistic animal like a cartoon bird just for fun. Finally, I'll write down my observations, noting the animals and plants in each habitat but might not include detailed descriptions.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing three different habitats. The first habitat is a garden with big yellow sunflowers and a few bees hovering around; label sunflowers and bees. The second is a pond scene with waterlilies, a frog on a lily pad, and generic fish under the water; label waterlilies, frog, and fish. The last is a forest with tall green oak trees, a squirrel on one branch, and mushrooms on the forest floor; label the squirrel. The style is colorful and slightly cartoonish reflecting a child’s drawing. Add small details like a smiling sun and fluffy clouds in the sky.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label various habitats and living things within them. While the student is proficient in depicting and labeling key elements like sunflowers, bees, frogs, and waterlilies, they might omit details like specific sunflower or fish types. A cartoonish style and minor imaginative elements, such as a smiling sun, are included to reflect the student's tendency to enhance realism with personal touches, in line with the task guidelines."
