  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label different types of habitats accurately, such as a garden, forest, or pond.",
    "The student is likely able to draw several kinds of plants in each habitat, like trees and flowers, and label them correctly.",
    "The student can draw a variety of animals specific to each habitat, such as squirrels in a forest or fish in a pond, with reasonable accuracy.",
    "The student is able to demonstrate diversity by comparing some different types of plants and animals across habitats, though there might be slight inaccuracies or omissions.",
    "The student can identify patterns in the types of living things found in similar habitats and attempt to represent these in drawings with mostly correct associations.",
    "The student can incorporate some details from real-life or media examples into their drawings, occasionally adding personal or imaginative elements.",
    "The student is able to document their investigation by recording observations consistently, but might lack detailed annotations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to label every element of their drawing, potentially missing some names or types of living things.",
    "The student might occasionally confuse which plants or animals belong to specific habitats, though these errors are not frequent.",
    "The student may not fully explore all possible patterns in biodiversity across habitats, focusing on more obvious examples rather than finer details.",
    "The student might inconsistently apply details from real-life observations, adding elements that don't fully align with the evidence statements provided."
