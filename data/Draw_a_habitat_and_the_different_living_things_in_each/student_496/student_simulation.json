  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start with the forest habitat. I’ll draw a few tall trees with green leaves and brown bark because I know forests have lots of trees. I’ll add a squirrel on one of the branches, and I’ll draw an ant on the ground to show how there are lots of small animals too. I should add some more animals, so I'll draw a bird in the sky and maybe a deer beside a tree. I need to label them all too. I remember to write 'Forest Habitat' at the top. Now, onto the pond habitat. I’ll draw a big blue shape for the pond water with lily pads on top, and I’ll add different fish swimming in there. Let’s not forget the clams at the bottom. For plants, I’ll add some pond weeds and write 'Pond Habitat' above it. I’ll make sure to label everything, like the fish and the plants. Sometimes I might misspell or forget a label, but I'll double-check my work. Now I need to use arrows or a legend to show how these living things differ in each habitat, showing the pattern. I’ll use bright colors like green and blue to highlight differences.",
  "Prompt": "A student's colorful drawing depicting two habitats. On the left, a forest habitat with tall green-leaved trees, a squirrel on a branch, an ant on the ground, a bird in the sky, and a deer near a tree. On the right, a pond habitat with blue water, lily pads, fish swimming, clams at the bottom, and aquatic plants. Labels identifying each living thing, with 'Forest Habitat' and 'Pond Habitat' visible above each respective section. Arrows or a legend to indicate differences in living things. The drawing is detailed but may have minor misspellings or missing labels. The style is colorful and child-like with clear effort to show diversity and patterns.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt focuses on an advanced representation of habitats by including a variety of living things with labels as described in the student's capabilities. The choice of habitats, diversity of lifeforms, and specific use of labels align with what the student can do. Potential misspellings or missing labels acknowledge minor gaps in performance without impacting the overall understanding, fitting the limitations described."
