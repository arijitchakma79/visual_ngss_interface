  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a habitat. I think of a playground as a land environment, so I’ll draw some grass because I know that's on the ground. I'll add a tree because I've seen trees in the park. I remember animals, so I’ll try to draw a simple cat because it's what I'm familiar with, even though I'm not sure if it lives in every habitat. I know fish live in water, but I'll make a mistake and draw a fish in the grass because I can’t tell habitats apart very well. I don’t really know other animals or plants specific to habitats, so I’ll just focus on these few things.",
  "Prompt": "A simplistic, child-like drawing of a habitat with a grassy area. Include a simple tree on the left with green treetop and brown trunk. Draw a basic cat shape with a face and tail in the middle of the grass. On the right, include a fish drawn above the grass, colored in orange. Use bright colors and emphasize a naive, elementary drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student is capable of doing, such as drawing a basic land environment like a playground with minimal detail. It also includes a couple of living things, a tree and a cat, depicted very simply. Placing a fish on land shows the student's struggle to accurately differentiate between habitats, demonstrating a misunderstanding typical at their current level. This aligns with showing little variety in plant and animal life and possible inaccuracies, such as mixing up animals across habitats."
