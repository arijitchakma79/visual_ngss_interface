  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might be able to show one type of habitat but with minimal detail (e.g., a simplistic drawing of a land environment like a playground).",
    "The student might include one or two living things in their drawing, though these may not be accurately depicted (e.g., a simple tree shape or a vague animal figure)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately identify or illustrate different types of habitats (e.g., the student may not differentiate between land and water environments).",
    "The student may not include a variety of plants and animals or could mix them up across habitats (e.g., placing fish in a land habitat).",
    "The student could struggle to compare diversity, resulting in similar drawings for different habitats or showing incorrect creatures (e.g., identical species in multiple habitats).",
    "The student might not observe or depict patterns of living things correctly (e.g., showing unfamiliar creatures that do not belong to the depicted habitat).",
    "The student is not likely to use the drawing as evidence of plant and animal diversity effectively (e.g., indistinguishable or incorrect depictions of diversity)."
