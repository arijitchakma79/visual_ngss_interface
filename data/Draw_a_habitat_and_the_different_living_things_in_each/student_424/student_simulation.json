  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start with the land habitat. I remember that lizards, squirrels, and ants usually live in places with trees and bushes. I'll draw some big trees with green leaves and maybe a fallen log for the squirrel. Underneath the trees, I'll add some bushes. I should also draw some lizards on a rock and ants on the ground. For the water habitat, I'll think about fish and clams that live underwater. I'll draw an ocean scene with blue water, some seaweed, and different types of fish swimming around. Near the bottom, I'll include clams on the sandy ocean floor. It's important to show how both environments are different, so in the comparison, I’ll focus on the plant and animal types. I might forget to label all the plants, like types of bushes, because I think it's obvious from the picture. I might also struggle to clearly show which types of grass are different if they’re close together, but I'll try my best.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a landscape depicting two distinct habitats: a land habitat and a water habitat. For the land habitat, include various types of trees, a fallen log, and bushes in different shades of green, with lizards on rocks and ants on the ground. Place a squirrel on a tree. For the water habitat, illustrate blue water with swimming fish in diverse colors, such as orange and yellow, and clams on the sandy bottom among waving green seaweed. Use a child-like drawing style with bright colors ensuring each habitat is distinct and vibrant.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately draw both land and water habitats and include diverse living things. It highlights the student's understanding by showcasing different animals and plants within each habitat, capturing the diversity required. The oversight in labeling specific plant or animal names and difficulty distinguishing between closely clustered plant types mirrors what the student may struggle with, staying true to the 'cannot' part of the description."
