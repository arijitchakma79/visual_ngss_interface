  "Reasoning": "I want to draw a habitat with different living things. I'll start by drawing a big area with grass because that's what I think of when imagining outdoors. I'll draw a big tree, maybe with a swing because I see those in playgrounds sometimes. What else is outdoors? A pond! I'll draw a blue oval for the pond, right next to the tree. I know fish live in water, so I'll put a fish in the pond, even if it looks too big for it. I'll also draw a flower next to the pond because flowers can be anywhere outside. I like butterflies, so I'll add a butterfly flying above everything. Maybe I should add another animal. I think a tiger is cool, so I'll draw a tiger walking near the tree. I don't really know where they belong, but they seem outdoor-ish. Everything looks fine, even if Iâ€™ve seen fish and tigers in a zoo mainly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like outdoor scene with verdant green grass covering most of the background. Include a large, swinging tree on one side with a brown trunk and green, fluffy top. Beside it, place an unnaturally large blue pond with a big, cartoonish fish jumping out. Add a colorful butterfly above the scene and a single bright flower near the pond edge. Include a bright orange tiger with black stripes walking next to the tree, reminiscent of a child's spontaneous creation. Use bright, bold colors and a naive, imaginative art style typical of beginner drawings.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw a habitat with specific, recognizable items such as the tree, pond, and butterfly, though they are misplaced and incorrectly scaled. The presence of mismatched elements like the tiger near the tree aligns with the student's misunderstanding of where animals belong. The fish and tiger's placements illustrate the confusion and inability to draw specific habitats distinctively, as described in the student's 'cannot' list. The use of a bright, child-like art style further mirrors the student's early level of understanding and skill in distinguishing different habitats or appropriately allocating living things to them."
