  "Topic": "Draw a habitat and the different living things in each",
  "Code": "2-LS4-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a habitat but might not clearly represent what makes it a specific habitat (e.g., draws a generic outdoor scene).",
    "The student might include a few recognizable living things, like a tree or a flower, but not with specific relation to the habitat (e.g., places a tree in a pond without context)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to draw different habitats distinctly (e.g., garden and pond look very similar, lacking defining features).",
    "The drawing may not show various types of living things appropriately placed or identified (e.g., draws fish in the sky).",
    "The student likely struggles to compare and include different plants and animals across habitats correctly (e.g., confusion about what animals belong where).",
    "Organizing similar living things in specific areas is probably inconsistent or missing (e.g., mixes all animals and plants randomly across the drawing).",
    "The drawing may lack evidence of thoughtful observation from media or firsthand, leading to random or inaccurate details about biodiversity (e.g., places a tiger in a playground)."
