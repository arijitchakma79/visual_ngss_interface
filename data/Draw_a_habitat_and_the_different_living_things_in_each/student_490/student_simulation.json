  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw a habitat and the different living things in each. Let’s start with a forest. I’ll draw a few trees first, maybe three tall ones. I remember in forests there are lots of plants, so I’ll add some flowers here too. For animals, a squirrel comes to mind, maybe climbing up one of the trees. That’s what lives in a forest, right? Now, onto the pond. I’ll draw a big oval shape for the pond water. I think there should be a fish swimming, so I'll add one in the water. I remember that frogs like ponds, so I’ll draw one on a rock near the water. I feel like there should be grass around the pond, and maybe a couple of flowers. I wish I could remember more animals in these habitats, but I think this is all I can remember. I’ll try to label the squirrel, fish, and frog but might forget or mix them up again.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing of two habitats on a single page. On the left, a forest scene with three tall green trees and a couple of colorful flowers on the ground. A brown squirrel is seen on one of the trees. On the right, a pond drawn as a large blue oval with a fish swimming inside. There’s a small frog sitting on a gray rock near the pond. Grass and a couple of flowers surround the pond. Labels next to the squirrel, fish, and frog that are somewhat unclear or have the potential to be mixed up. Use basic color pencils, showing an earnest but sparse style typical of a young elementary student.",
  "Explaination": "The image matches the student's abilities because it includes basic elements of each habitat: trees and a squirrel for the forest; a pond, fish, and frog for the aquatic setting. The drawing reflects limited detail and diversity, correlating with the student's emerging understanding. The mixing of labels or sparse use reflects their struggles with organization and specificity, authentic to their developmental level."
