  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately represent the full range of differences between land habitats and water habitats, possibly confusing which animals or plants belong in each (e.g., drawing a fish in a forest).",
    "The student may not show consistent labeling or organization in the drawing, making it unclear what the observations are (e.g., missing labels or mixing up names).",
    "The student might show inaccurate patterns of diversity, such as drawing an equal number of animals in both a pond and forest without considering the actual diversity typical of each habitat (e.g., placing the same number of trees and fish in a pond habitat)."
