  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant that has water. I remember that a healthy plant should have green leaves, so I'll draw it with green leaves. I know the plant should look nice and healthy, but I'm not sure how to make it look really vibrant, so I'll just color the leaves a simple green. Maybe I should draw a flower too, but I'm not sure about the color, so it might not look very bright. Now, for the plant without water, I’ll draw the leaves looking a bit droopy and maybe a little brown. That shows it's unhealthy. I think this makes the plant look very different from the healthy one. I remember something about plants needing light too, maybe I should draw the sun, but I often forget about it. I’ll skip it this time because I’m focused on how the plant looks. I'm also supposed to label parts, but I get confused with the names sometimes, so I might skip labeling or get them wrong.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two plants side by side on a sunny day. The plant on the left is healthy with simple green leaves and maybe a flower, but not overly vibrant. The plant on the right appears unhealthy with drooping brownish leaves. The plants are drawn in a basic, child-like style with colored pencils or crayons, emphasizing a side-by-side comparison of health.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing the difference between a healthy plant and an unhealthy plant with attention to the leaves' color and position. It reflects the student's difficulty in showing optimal vibrancy or details like the sun and avoids complex labeling, aligning with the described limitations."
