  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a picture of plants with and without water, but I'm not too sure how to show all the differences. So, I'll start by drawing a big simple shape for a plant. I'll make it look like a puffy cloud because that's how I imagine a plant's shape, even if it doesn't quite look like leaves or stems like I see outside. I remember that plants need the sun, so I'll draw a big circle above the plant to be the sun. Let's add another 'plant' next to this, and I'll try to show that these two plants are different somehow. I think I'll draw some squiggly lines around one plant to show it's 'different', but I'm not sure how to show it needs water. Maybe I can add some 'raindrop' shapes around one plant, but it's tricky because I'm not sure where to put them or how they should look. The plant shapes still look the same because Iâ€™m not sure how to make them look healthy or dry.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing two big cloud-like shapes meant to represent plants side by side. Above them, a simple yellow circle meant to be the sun. On one plant, there's a swirly line around it, representing an attempt at showing it's different, while raindrop shapes are scattered around it. The plants are the same puffy shapes without clear features like leaves or stems, and all are in a simplistic, cartoonish style, with crayon-like colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities and limitations as they can draw basic plant shapes and a sun symbol, but struggle to depict healthy versus dry plants or correctly show the need for water. The plants lack detail and diversity, as elements like leaves or color differences are missing, aligning with their beginning level understanding."
