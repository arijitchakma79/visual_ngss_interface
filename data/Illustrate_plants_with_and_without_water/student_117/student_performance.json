  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a simple shape intended to be a plant, but it lacks clear features such as leaves or stems.",
    "The student might attempt to draw something symbolic for sun, like a circle, but the placement and role of the sun may not be clear."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot clearly illustrate a healthy plant with bright green leaves and sturdy stems. The drawing may not distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants (e.g., no color difference or incomplete features).",
    "The student is unlikely to represent a wilted or dry plant with brown leaves. Differences between healthy and dry plants are not shown (e.g., leaves look the same regardless of condition).",
    "The student cannot correctly include elements like water or their effects, such as rain or a watering can, to indicate plants needing water (e.g., water might be missing or drawn without context).",
    "The student cannot effectively create a comparison in their drawing to show differences in plants with and without water (e.g., all plants may look similar or indistinguishable)."
