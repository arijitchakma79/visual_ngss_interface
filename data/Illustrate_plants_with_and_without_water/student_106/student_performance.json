    "The student can draw a plant that appears generally healthy and growing if they include raindrops or a sun to indicate water and light are present.",
    "The student may depict a wilting or drooping plant to suggest it lacks water, often using brown or a drooped stem.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may fail to clearly differentiate the appearance of plants with water versus without. For example, they might not show clear signs of water or light. *(student may not know what 'healthy' looks like)*",
    "The student might include elements that are irrelevant or misunderstood, such as drawing clouds without rain, or the sun at night. *(student does not grasp which elements affect plant health)*",
    "The student could show inconsistent patterns between water presence and plant health, sometimes drawing a healthy plant without any water symbols. *(student inconsistently applies understanding of waterâ€™s role)*"
