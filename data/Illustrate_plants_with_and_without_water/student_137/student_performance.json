  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic plant shape, possibly resembling a stick figure-like representation of a plant.",
    "The student might include some kind of water source, although its significance may not be clear (e.g., a water drop or cloud nearby)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show a clear difference between a healthy and unhealthy plant (e.g., both plants might look the same or have minor, unclear changes).",
    "The student may not depict wilting accurately or at all (e.g., plants might always look upright and healthy-looking, possibly due to misunderstanding of wilting effects).",
    "The student is unlikely to distinguish the need for water specifically and may not show its absence as a factor in plant health (e.g., water might be present for all plants drawn).",
    "The student probably won't represent the importance of sunlight or how it affects growth (e.g., no sun in the drawing or not shown to affect the plant).",
    "There might be an overuse or misplacement of symbols that don't correlate to plant health (e.g., random lines or circles meant to represent something like wilting but with no context)."
