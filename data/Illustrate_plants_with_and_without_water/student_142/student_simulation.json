  "Reasoning": "I remember that plants need water to stay healthy. So, if I'm drawing a healthy plant, the leaves should look nice and green. I'll draw a big plant with some large green leaves. But I'm not sure how to show the stem well, so I'll just make it a straight line. For a plant without water, I think the leaves start to droop and might turn brown. I'll draw another plant beside the first one. Its leaves will look kind of droopy, and I'll color some parts brown. But I remember seeing a plant where only parts of it dried, so I'll leave some leaves green by mistake. This seems okay. I'll try to show one plant as healthy and the other as not so healthy, using what I saw in the classroom. I think it might look similar, though, because I'm not sure about other parts like flowers or roots.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side drawing of two house plants in pots. The plant on the left has large, vibrant green leaves suggesting health. The plant on the right has some leaves drawn as droopy and partially brown indicating it lacks water, but some leaves remain green by mistake. The pots are simple terracotta in color. The drawing style is childlike with simple lines and basic colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by showing an attempt to differentiate a well-watered and a wilting plant through leaf color and position. The prompt reflects the student's emerging understanding by having some inconsistencies, like partially green leaves on the neglected plant, showing confusion about water effects. This aligns with the student missing detailed plant elements and not consistently illustrating the symptoms of water neglect."
