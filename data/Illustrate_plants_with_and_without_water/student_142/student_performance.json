  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with some healthy leaves, suggesting it has access to water, but may miss detailing other parts clearly.",
    "The student can depict a plant with wilted or dry leaves, indicating a lack of water, but with some inconsistencies in the drawing (e.g., drying only some leaves or showing healthy parts incorrectly).",
    "The student can attempt to show differences between a well-watered plant and a dry plant, but with limited details and possible omissions.",
    "The student might use some basic classroom observations to hint at the differences in plant health with and without water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to consistently and accurately show the overall differences in appearance between well-watered and non-watered plants (e.g., mixing up which plant should look healthy or wilited).",
    "The student may struggle to provide a clear justification or evidence in the drawing that plants need water to grow (e.g., forgetting to show symptoms linked to water neglect or only depicting vague differences).",
    "The student might inaccurately represent the effects of water by showing parts of the plant healthy and other parts wilting without consistent reasoning or logic (confusion about what water impacts)."
