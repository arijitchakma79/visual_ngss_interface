  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a picture of a healthy plant with water. I remember that when plants get water, they look lively. I'll make sure the leaves are full and green. I'll add a lot of small leaves to show it's healthy. Next, I'll draw the plant without water. I remember seeing plants without water, and they looked sad, with drooping leaves. I'll draw the leaves hanging down and looking a bit brownish. Let me draw the sun in the sky for both plants because I know plants need sunlight too. I'll make sure the sun is bright and in the same position in both drawings. I need to label them properly, so for the first one, I'll write 'Plant with Water' and for the second one 'Plant without Water'. I might struggle a bit to make sure the labels are perfectly neat, but I'll try my best.",
  "Prompt": "Create two side-by-side illustrations of plants. The first image should show a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves and a tall stem, and the sun shining brightly above it. The second image should depict a wilting plant with drooping, brownish leaves under the same bright sun. Include clear labels for each image: 'Plant with Water' for the healthy one and 'Plant without Water' for the wilting one. Use a realistic drawing style with emphasis on color saturation and leaf details to represent the plant's health.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities because it includes detailed and accurate elements of healthy and wilting plants in two different states, perfectly capturing the key differences in appearance and maintaining consistency with the requirement of depicting the sun. The labels are included as intended by the student, reflecting their ability to properly identify each picture despite potential minor imperfections in neatness."
