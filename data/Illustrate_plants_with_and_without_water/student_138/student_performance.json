  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant with water that looks somewhat healthier than a plant without water.",
    "The student can represent in their drawing that a plant without water looks wilted, although details may be simplistic or inconsistent.",
    "The student may inconsistently include sunlight in their drawing to suggest it as a factor for plant health, but this may not always be clear."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to correctly show the thriving aspects of a plant with both sunlight and water and may omit one of these elements entirely.",
    "The student may not clearly indicate the difference in appearance between the healthy plant and wilting plant, focusing on water only without noting sunlight.",
    "The student might depict both plants similarly, showing misunderstanding of the significant appearance difference due to water availability (student may think all plants look the same regardless)."
