  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a healthy plant that has been watered. I remember that plants with enough water have strong stems and bright green leaves, so I’ll sketch a plant with big, vibrant green leaves and a thick stem. I’ll also add a watering can above it to show that it’s getting water. Hmm... for the plant without water, I need to show it looking wilted. I'll make its leaves droopy and brownish, with a thin, weak stem. To make it clear these are two different conditions, I'll draw the wilted plant next to the healthy plant. I won't forget to make the healthy plant look like it’s under the sun with light rays shining down, and the other plant in the shade to show how it struggles without light. Although I should label all the parts like the roots and stem, I sometimes forget to label them all accurately, so the drawing might not have all parts labeled. I won’t use much detail about the soil since I’m focusing on water and light.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side depictions of the same type of potted plant in a crayon style with bright colors. On the left, illustrate a healthy plant with a strong green stem and large, vibrant green leaves, with a blue watering can above indicating it has been watered. Add sunlight with yellow rays shining on the plant. On the right, show the same plant wilted, with brownish drooping leaves and a thin, weak stem, in a shaded area without sunlight. Omit explicit labels for plant parts. The overall style should be suitable for a detailed grade-level drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict plants with and without water by showing the differences in health and appearances of two plants, highlighting characteristics like stem strength and leaf color. It aligns with the student's skills by including a water source and sunlight, but does not focus on labeling every plant part or soil quality, reflecting the areas they struggle with."
