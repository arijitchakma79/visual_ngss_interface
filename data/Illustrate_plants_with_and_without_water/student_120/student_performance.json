    "The student can draw a plant with healthy, green leaves when it has enough water, demonstrating an accurate understanding of a well-watered plant's appearance.",
    "The student can draw a plant with brown, wilted leaves when it does not have enough water, clearly showing signs of a plant lacking water.",
    "The student can illustrate the difference between a plant with and without water using noticeable changes in the plant's appearance, such as leaf color and posture.",
    "The student can show that plants need water to live and grow by comparing their pictures of plants with and without water and clearly showing the contrast.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "May inconsistently label parts of the plant or descriptions of the water status, potentially leaving out or slightly misplacing labels (e.g., mislabeling leaves as stems).",
    "Might occasionally overemphasize differences in plant size that aren't as significant as leaf condition, though the main concept is communicated well."
