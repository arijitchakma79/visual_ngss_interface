  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two plants next to each other. The first plant will be the one with water. I remember that a healthy plant should have some green leaves, so I’ll draw a few of those. I might make the stem stand upright a bit, but I’m not sure about adding flowers or making the leaves really vibrant since that’s a bit tricky for me. For the plant without water, I know it should look unhealthy. I’ll try to show this by making the leaves a bit less green and adding some droopiness to the stem. I’m not sure about including any brown spots or specific dehydration signs since I’m not completely sure what they look like. I know water is important, but my drawing might not completely show how essential it is. Let’s see how I can show the differences.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side drawing of two potted plants. The plant with water has a few green leaves, its stems are mostly upright, but there aren't any flowers, and the leaves aren't fully vibrant. The plant without water shows droopy stems and less vibrant leaves with a bit of a dull green color. There are no brown spots or specific signs of dehydration. The overall style is child-like, with basic shapes and colors using crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by showing some green leaves and upright stems for the healthy plant, and droopiness for the unhealthy one. It avoids including flowers or uniformly vibrant leaves, acknowledging the student's limitations in depicting complete plant health. The absence of brown spots and other specific dehydration signs aligns with the student not recognizing or drawing them. The basic crayon style suits the student's developmental level and the task requirements."
