  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing the healthy plant with plenty of water. I know it should have vibrant green leaves and a strong stem, so I'll make sure the leaves look bright and the plant is standing upright. Next to it, I'll draw a wilted plant without water. I'll make its leaves droop down and look less lively. I want the differences between the two to be clear, so I'll put them side-by-side. Oh, I almost forgot about sunlight, I'll draw a sun in the sky above, maybe adding some rays reaching towards both plants. I won't worry too much about leaf color variations or minor details like perfectly labeling the water source or sunlight direction, because I sometimes struggle with those. I'll focus instead on making the main differences clear.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of two plants side-by-side. The plant on the left is healthy, with a tall stem and bright green leaves. The plant on the right is wilted, with bent stems and drooping, dull leaves. Above both plants is a sun, with rays shining downwards. The drawing should use clear colors and a simple, child-like art style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by clearly depicting the differences between a healthy and unhealthy plant, focusing on major visual elements like vibrant leaves and drooping stems. The struggle areas, like subtle differences in leaf color and labeling the water or sunlight perfectly, are reflected by using a simple drawing style that emphasizes the main contrasts rather than the finer details."
