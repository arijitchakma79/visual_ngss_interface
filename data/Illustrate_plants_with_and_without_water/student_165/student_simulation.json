  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw some plants. I know plants have leaves and stems, so I'll start with that. I'll make two plants. I think I'll also draw the sun because it's always in the sky with plants. Now, I need to show one plant with water and one without. I'm not sure how to show a plant without water differently, so I'll just make both plants look the same. Maybe they'll have some leaves and a stem. I'm not sure how to show some of the leaves being wilted or brown, so I'll make them all green. I don't really know what roots look like, so I won't include them. I heard something about needing soil or ground, but I forgot what that looks like, so I'll skip that too. I just know plants need water and light, but I'm not sure how to draw that.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple plant shapes with stems and leaves. Place a bright yellow sun in the top corner of the drawing. Both plants look similar, with green leaves on both. Do not show any roots or soil. The drawing should have a colorful and child-like style, using crayons or markers. There are no labels, arrows, or differences between the two plants.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt captures what the student can do, including drawing simple plant shapes and the sun. The plants look similar and healthy due to the student's lack of understanding to differentiate well-watered plants and dry plants. The omission of roots, soil, and any labels matches the student's difficulty in connecting these elements to plant health, reflecting their beginning level understanding."
