  "Reasoning": "I'll draw two plants side by side to show one with water and one without. I remember that plants need water to stay healthy, so for the healthy plant, I will draw the leaves reaching upwards and use some green color, but I don't have the exact shade, so it might not be very vibrant. For the plant without water, I will draw the leaves droopy and kind of brownish because I think plants without water look sad and unhealthy. I’ll add a sun in the sky because I think I learned that plants need sunlight, but I'm not sure where to put it or if I should write 'sun' next to it. I’ll put some soil under the plants, though I’m not sure how it should look when it's healthy or unhealthy.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side illustrations of plants in a simple style with limited details. The left plant should have green leaves that are reaching upwards, representing a somewhat healthy plant with water. The right plant should have droopy brownish leaves to depict a plant without water, looking unhealthy. Include a bright yellow sun in the sky, without a label, to suggest sunlight is present. The soil under both plants should be similar, simple, and unremarkable. Use basic colors to reflect a developing understanding of vibrant tones.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt aligns with the student's ability to illustrate basic differences in plant health due to water levels, as shown through leaf positioning and color. However, the colors may lack vibrancy, and both plants might appear somewhat similar in condition. The sunlight is depicted but not labeled clearly or completely integrated into the scene. The soil appears basic, reflecting the student’s misunderstanding of how it contributes to plant health."
