  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw two plants. First, I’ll draw the plant that is healthy. I remember that healthy plants look green, so I'll make sure to use green for the leaves and brown for the stem. I'll draw some big green leaves to show it looks healthy. I think they also need sunlight, but I'm not sure how to show that, so I’ll skip it. Next, I'll draw the plant that doesn’t have water. I think that plant would look a little droopy or wilting, so I’ll make the leaves hang down a bit. They will still be green because I don't remember any other colors that they might be. Maybe I'll make the stem a little bent. Again, I’m not sure how to show it doesn’t have enough light or water, so I’ll just focus on making it look droopy. I hope this shows the differences well enough.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two plants. The first plant looks healthy with big, green leaves and a sturdy brown stem. The second plant looks a bit droopy, with the leaves hanging down. The second plant's leaves are still green, and the stem is slightly bent. The drawing is done in a simple style with colored pencils, focusing on the leaves and stem without background elements like sunlight or a clear water source.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects what the student can do by showing a healthy plant with basic elements like green leaves, indicating enough water. It also captures the student's attempt to show a lack of water through wilting or droopy leaves while retaining their green color. The absence of elements like sunlight or a clear depiction of water sources aligns with the student's struggle to include these accurately. The simple style and color choices align with their developing level of understanding."
