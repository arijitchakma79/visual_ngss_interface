  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two pictures side by side. Both will be of the same plant, maybe a flower like a sunflower because they're my favorite. For the first picture, I'll show the plant with water. I'll color the leaves green and make the stem stand straight and strong. I'll also add some blue water droplets near the roots to show it has water. I'll remember to draw the sun above it because plants need sunlight too. For the second picture, I'll illustrate the same plant but without water. I'm not really sure what it should look like, but I'll try making the leaves a little lighter green and droopy. The stem will tilt a bit, but I don't want to make it look too sick because plants are usually green, right? Maybe I'll add a couple of water droplets here too, just in case I forget they need water. I hope it's clear that this plant is different from the first one.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side illustration of two sunflowers drawn by a child. The sunflower on the left has bright green leaves and a tall, strong stem, with small blue water droplets near the roots and a yellow sun in the sky. The sunflower on the right has lighter green, drooping leaves, and a slightly tilted stem with a couple of blue droplets near the roots. Both flowers have the same large, round, yellow center and petals. The style is simplistic and colorful, typical of a developing child's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw basic differences and use general symbols. Although the student includes some details like straight vs. droopy stems and water symbols, they are inconsistent with water droplets, reflecting their struggle to accurately depict dehydrated plants. The sun is included in one picture, showing the student's occasional omission of additional needs like light."
