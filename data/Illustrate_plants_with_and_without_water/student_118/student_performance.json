  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a plant that is somewhat recognizable as healthy and has basic features like green leaves and a sturdy stem to suggest it is growing when there is imagined water present.",
    "Depict a plant that looks somewhat wilted or droopy to indicate poor health when it does not receive enough water.",
    "Include basic elements like a sun to suggest that plants need light, although this may not be clearly linked to the plant's health."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently depict clear differences between plants with enough water and those without, particularly if asked to show more detailed, realistic symptoms of under-watering (e.g., color changes in leaves beyond wilting, which might be omitted or incorrectly added).",
    "Show with confidence that both water and light are necessary for plant life, possibly showing both but without a clear relationship (e.g., drawing the sun but not indicating it helps the plant grow).",
    "Identify patterns connecting specific plant features with the presence or absence of water (e.g., student might incorrectly label a healthy-looking plant as thirsty due to misunderstanding the visual cues)."
