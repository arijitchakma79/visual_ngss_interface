  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two plants to show the difference between having water and not having water. I remember plants with water are healthy. I’ll start by drawing a plant with green leaves and a sturdy stem — that should show it’s healthy. I think I should add a sun, because I know sunlight is important, even if I'm not sure how it affects the plant's health. For the plant without water, I’ll make it look droopy and maybe bend the leaves to show it's not doing well. I’m not sure if I should change the color of the leaves, so I’ll just leave them green but wilting.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two plants side by side. The plant on the left is healthy, with bright green leaves and a thick, sturdy stem. A simple yellow sun is drawn above to suggest sunlight. The plant on the right looks droopy, with bent leaves, indicating it lacks water, but still maintains a green color. The background is simple with no complex elements.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing has a plant that looks healthy and sturdy with green leaves, indicating it's growing with water. It shows basic elements like a sun, adhering to the student's ability to show light but without clear linkage to health. The wilting plant lacks water but does not show detailed symptoms like color change, consistent with what the student cannot do."
