  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing two plants side by side. On the left, I'll draw a healthy plant. I remember that a healthy plant usually has big, green leaves and stands upright, so I'll make sure to draw the leaves looking bright and strong. Next, for the plant that doesn't have enough water, I'll draw it next to the healthy one. I recall that a plant without water often looks droopy, so I'll make the leaves hang down and color them a little brown or yellowish to show it's not healthy. I remember that the most important thing about this task is to show the difference between the two plants. I might forget to label which plant is without water or not label it clearly, which I know I need to work on. I'll mainly focus on showing the big differences between their conditions rather than any sunlight effects since water is supposed to be the main factor here. I'm not great at showing how a plant changes over time, so I'll just keep it simple and show a single moment for both plants.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two potted plants side by side. The plant on the left should look healthy, with vibrant green leaves and upright stems. The plant on the right should look unhealthy, with drooping leaves that are brown or yellow. The style should be a simplistic children's drawing with clear outlines and bright colors. The background should be simple to ensure the focus remains on the plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it focuses on clear differences between a healthy and an unhealthy plant without requiring detailed progression or finer details like sunlight effects. It doesn't emphasize detailed labeling, which the student might struggle with, and instead focuses on easily distinguishable visual differences that do not require a time-lapse sequence."
