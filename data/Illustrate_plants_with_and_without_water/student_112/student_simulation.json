  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two plants to show the differences between one with enough water and one without. I'll start with the healthy plant by drawing its tall and strong stem and nice, green leaves. I'll add a bright sun above it, because I remember that plants need sunlight too. Next, I'll draw the soil and show some roots going into it to indicate how the plant gets water. Now, for the plant without enough water, I'll make the leaves brown and wilting. The stem will look a bit droopy to show it's not healthy. I'll also want to indicate that there's not much water around, so it makes sense to keep the soil looking dry and maybe with fewer roots visible. I should also draw a second sunlit plant and one in the dark to show the differences in health. Maybe I'll forget some small things like labeling each root or every sun ray, but the main ideas will be there. Finally, I'll include a variety of plant types to show how different plants are affected by the water they get.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a side-by-side illustration of two plants. On the left, depict a healthy plant with a strong stem, vibrant green leaves, and a bright sun shining overhead. Show roots extending into rich soil. On the right, depict a plant with brown, wilting leaves and a droopy stem, set in dry soil, under a less prominent sun. Include a sunlit plant and one in shadow for comparison. Show different types of plants to capture growth patterns with varying water supply. Use colorful crayons to represent the vitality of the healthy plants, while the withering one has muted brown tones.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt encompasses what the student can doâ€”drawing healthy and unhealthy plants, illustrating sunlight, showing soil and roots, and depicting plant variations. It also accounts for elements they might overlook, such as missing labels for some roots or sun rays, aligning with the student's strengths and occasional oversights."
