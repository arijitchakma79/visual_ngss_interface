  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a healthy plant because I remember it has bright green leaves and stands upright. I'll make sure the leaves look lively and maybe add a few details like a flower. Next, I'll draw another plant that isn’t doing well without water. I think I should focus on making the leaves look wilted and maybe turning brown at the edges, and the stem should droop a bit. This way, it looks clear which plant has enough water and which doesn’t. I’ll draw these plants side by side so it’s easy to compare them. I’ll add some notes to describe how the thirsty plant is affected, like ‘drooping leaves and dull color’. I might forget to label something like the roots, though, because I'm focused on the leaves. I also remember that patterns like growth stages are a bit tricky for me, so I won’t include them.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two side-by-side plants. The left plant is healthy with bright green leaves and a small flower, illustrating a well-watered condition. The right plant shows signs of not having enough water, with brown-edged, wilted leaves and a drooping stem. The colors should emphasize the contrast: vibrant greens for the healthy plant and dull greens with browns for the thirsty plant. There are some notes that read 'drooping leaves' and 'dull color'. The style is a simple pencil and crayon drawing typical of a proficient elementary school student. There are noticeable details missing such as roots or growth stages.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: show healthy and unhealthy plants, note differences like leaf color and drooping, and place them side by side for comparison. It also reflects what they struggle with, such as missing labels for roots due to oversight and not illustrating growth patterns, which aligns with their proficiency level."
