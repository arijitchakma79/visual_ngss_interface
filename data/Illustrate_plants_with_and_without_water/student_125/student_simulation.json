  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to illustrate plants with and without water. I’ll start by drawing a plant. I remember that plants have green parts like leaves and stems, so I will make sure to color them in green. First, I'll draw a stem and put some leaves on it. I know plants stand tall, so I'll make the stem go upwards. I’m not sure how to show water in the drawing, but I’ll make the plant look lively by adding lots of leaves. For the second plant, I think I’ll draw it the same way because I’m not clear on how to make it look different if it doesn’t have water. Both plants will have green stems and leaves. I don’t think adding water drops or any other details is needed because I don't understand how to show the plant needs water to grow.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants. Both plants have green stems and leaves. The first plant is standing upright with multiple green leaves, symbolizing a generic plant. The second plant looks similar to the first, also with a green stem and leaves but slightly tilted. The background is plain white, and the style is similar to a children's crayon drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw simple features of plants like green stems and leaves, adhering to what the student CAN do. There’s no distinction between a healthy and an unhealthy plant, as the student is not aware of how to integrate the role of water. The drawing lacks a clear pattern or additional details that show the necessity of water for plant health, which aligns with what the student CANNOT do."
