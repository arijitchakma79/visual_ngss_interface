  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw a plant with some green parts without consistently showing water as a necessary element. (Student may rely on generic features like color but not explicitly link to water.)",
    "The student attempts to draw a plant but may only capture simple features like leaves or stems without context."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely does not show a clear distinction between a healthy plant and an unhealthy plant. (Student does not understand the role of water in plant health.)",
    "The drawing probably lacks clear patterns to differentiate between a plant with water and a plant without it. (Misunderstands or omits the idea of water being essential.)",
    "The student is unlikely to use the drawing to communicate that plants need water to live and grow. (Fails to make the connection between water and plant growth.)"
