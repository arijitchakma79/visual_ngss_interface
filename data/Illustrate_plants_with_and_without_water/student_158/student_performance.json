  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate a basic plant shape and some elements that indicate whether it is growing or not (e.g., leaves drooping or standing upright).",
    "The student can partially show a plant that has enough water by drawing it with some leaves upright or green.",
    "The student may identify and label a few basic parts of a plant like the stem or leaves, though inconsistently.",
    "The student can draw a simple bright environment to indicate the presence of light, though details may be minimal."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to consistently represent the absence of water correctly (e.g., may draw the plant upright even without water).",
    "The student may not accurately show the struggle of a plant in a dark environment (e.g., plant still appears healthy even under a rock).",
    "The student often omits or incorrectly labels parts of the plant, missing aspects like roots or flower parts (e.g., root labeled as leaf).",
    "The student has difficulty illustrating the relationship between water and plant growth clearly (e.g., lack of differentiation between watered and unwatered plants).",
    "The student may not yet incorporate the concept that plants need both water and light, missing drawing environments that provide these needs."
