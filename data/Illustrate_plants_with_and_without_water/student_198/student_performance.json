  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly show the difference between healthy and wilting plants, possibly focusing too much on one form (e.g., both plants look too similar).",
    "The student struggles to illustrate how water specifically helps plants live and grow (e.g., no depiction of roots absorbing water or water cycle processes).",
    "The student may not accurately identify and represent the pattern that plants need water to survive - might miss clear visual contrasts or correct labeling *(student doesnâ€™t fully understand the connection between water and plant health)*."
