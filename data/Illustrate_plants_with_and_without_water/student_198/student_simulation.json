  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two plants, one with water and one without. First, I'll draw the healthy plant. I remember that healthy plants have leaves and a stem, so I’ll start with that. I’ll draw a tall stem and add some leaves, but I don’t really know what other details to add, so I’ll keep it simple. For the plant without water, I know it should look different, maybe drooping a bit. I’ll make the stem lean over a little and the leaves hang down. I think that shows it doesn’t have water. But, I'm not sure how exactly water affects plants, so I won’t add anything like roots or anything about how water moves. Hopefully, this shows two different plants, but they look a bit similar because I can't really picture what changes water makes.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side plants. The plant on the left is healthy, with a simple green stem and a few leaves coming off it, standing upright. The plant on the right is similar in structure but has the stem bent slightly and leaves drooping downwards to show it is lacking water. Use basic colors to show the green of the leaves and stem, with a blue background representing the simplicity of a child's drawing. Both plants should look somewhat similar in size and shape due to the student's level of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic plant structures (leaves and stem) but stops short of conveying deeper details, like root systems or water processes. The healthy plant is depicted with simple features to match the student's emerging understanding, and the wilting plant attempts to show drooping but lacks clear differentiation due to the student's struggles with contrast. The use of basic colors and a simple style aligns with the student's developmental stage and their focus on basic differences without much scientific accuracy."
