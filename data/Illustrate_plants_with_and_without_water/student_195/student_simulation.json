  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant that has plenty of water. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves and they stand upright. For this, I’ll use a bright green color to show that the leaves are fresh and vibrant. Now, I’ll add stems that are straight up because I know that’s how healthy plants look. Next to it, I’ll draw another plant but this one without water. I read that when plants don’t get water, they look unhealthy. So, I’ll show brown leaves to make the plant look dried out and maybe droop the stems to show wilting. I remember from observing plants over time that this happens. I’ll try to show maybe a few stages like the plant starting to droop, then a bit more, and finally almost completely wilted. This should help show how plants change when they don’t get water. I’m pretty good at showing the big differences, like green versus brown colors, but sometimes I miss the smaller details. I’ll finish by looking for patterns in how both plants grow, but I might not be able to write a lot about why plants need water.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side diagrams of plants in a childlike art style. The first plant should be healthy with bright green leaves and upright stems, showing that it has plenty of water. The second plant should look unhealthy with brown leaves and drooping stems, representing lack of water. Use simple lines and colors to create a clear contrast between the two plants. Include a sequence of stages for the second plant showing increasing wilting, in a simple, clear way.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to clearly draw and differentiate a healthy plant and an unhealthy plant using obvious visual cues like color and structure. The student can depict major differences accurately, like using bright green for healthy leaves and brown for dry, wilting leaves. The prompt asks for a sequence of wilting, showing the student's capacity to observe basic changes over time. However, it does not require subtle details or an explanation of the reasons behind these differences, aligning with the student's struggle in providing detailed reasons for why water is essential for plants."
