  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw two plants side by side. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves and sturdy stems, so I’ll start with that. I’ll also draw the sun in the sky to show it’s a sunny day. I need to show the difference with a plant without water, so I'll make its leaves wilted or brown and the stem drooping. I think it will help to make the soil under the healthy plant look moist, while under the unhealthy plant it looks dry. I heard both plants and animals need water; maybe I can include a small animal like a bird or a butterfly looking for water, but I’m not sure how to show it needs water. I’ll definitely draw just one of each plant, since that keeps things simple and clearer to me.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration featuring two plants side by side on a sunny day. The plant on the left is healthy, with vibrant green leaves and a sturdy stem, standing upright. The soil beneath it appears moist. The plant on the right looks unhealthy, with wilted, brown leaves and a drooping stem. The soil here looks dry and cracked. A small bird stands near the plants, hinting that it might need water. Use soft, vibrant colors, appropriate for a drawing by a student at a proficient level with attention to key details like the differences in the plants’ appearances.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can draw well, highlighting the characteristics of healthy and unhealthy plants due to water availability. It acknowledges the student's understanding of differences between the plants without overcomplicating it with multiple examples. The inclusion of a bird nods to the idea that animals need water too, although this is not as clearly articulated, remaining consistent with the student's challenge in expressing this concept."
