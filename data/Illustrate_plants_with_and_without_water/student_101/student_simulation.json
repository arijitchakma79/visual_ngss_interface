  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a plant. I think a plant has a straight line for the stem, like a stick. I’ll add some ovals or circles on the sides for leaves. Plants are usually green, but I think putting some blue on the leaves might look nice. I'm not sure what a thirsty plant looks like, so I'll draw another plant next to it that looks the same because I think plants all look alike. I don’t really know how to show a plant without water. I should make them the same because I think they would look just like each other anyway.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two plants side by side. Each plant has a simple, vertical green line for a stem and circular or oval green leaves. The student uses blue sporadically on some leaves for personal preference, not related to plant health. The drawing is childlike, with no signs of wilting or color changes to represent dehydration.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches what the student can do by showing basic shapes to represent plants, adding color without purpose, and illustrating plants that look identical regardless of water. It matches what the student cannot do, as there are no visible differences between the two plants, no indication of wilting, and no understanding of water's effect on plant health."
