    "The student might occasionally omit elements like the sun or raindrops, leading to a less complete demonstration of why the plant is healthy or unhealthy (e.g., only showing water but not light).",
    "The student could mix up representations, such as drawing irregular patterns for wilting leaves but not clearly connecting it to the lack of water (e.g., *(student does not always show why leaves wilt)*)."
