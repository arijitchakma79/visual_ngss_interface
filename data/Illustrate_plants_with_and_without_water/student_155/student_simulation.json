  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two separate pots to show the plants. One is for the plant with water, and the other is without water. For the plant with water, I remember to draw it with lots of green leaves and it looks tall and strong because it’s healthy. I’ll add some flowers to show it’s growing well. Then I’ll draw the plant without water. I’ll make the leaves droopy and brown to show it’s wilting because it doesn’t have enough water. I know plants need sunlight too, so I’ll put a sun in the sky over both plants. But I might forget to add raindrops or something to show water for the healthy plant, so it's not as clear why it's healthy. I’ll make the background light blue to look like the sky. Sometimes I think my wilting leaves don’t look right, but I’ll try my best to show that they are sad leaves because there’s no water.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of two potted plants on a sunny day. On the left, a healthy plant with green leaves and colorful flowers, standing tall in a pot. On the right, a wilted plant with drooping, brown leaves in another pot, showing signs of not having water. Both plants are under a bright yellow sun with a light blue sky as the background. Drawing style is a colorful, simple child’s illustration.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to show a healthy plant and a wilting plant under the sun, aligning with their proficiency level. It includes the healthy elements like green leaves and flowers, but lacks explicit representation of water with raindrops, which the student sometimes forgets. The description respects the student's occasional struggle to represent why the plant on the right is wilting."
