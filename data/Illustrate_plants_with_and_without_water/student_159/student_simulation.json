  "Reasoning": "I know I need to draw two plants, one with enough water and one without, so I’ll start by drawing the healthy plant. I’ll give it big, green leaves and a tall, firm stem. I remember seeing how bright the leaves look on my mom's plants when they have enough water. Now, for the plant without water, I’ll make the leaves droopy and the stem bent to show it's wilting. This shows the difference between getting water and not getting water. I'll draw both plants next to each other so it's easy to see the comparison. I think adding a sun is important because plants also need sunlight, but I might forget to make it really clear about soil and air. I'll put the plants in a pot but might not show the soil too well or say much about it. Let's make the pot brown. Okay, now I have two plants, one happy with water and one sad without, and a sun above them.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side illustration of two potted plants. The plant on the left is healthy, with large, green leaves and an upright, firm stem, sitting in a brown pot. The plant on the right is wilting, with droopy leaves and a bent stem, also in a brown pot. Both plants are under a yellow sun in the sky, symbolizing the shared need for sunlight. The drawing should have a child-like, colorful style, with attention on the water effect and basic elements like the sun, but minimal emphasis on soil.",
  "Explanation": "The illustration prompt reflects the student's ability to show a clear side-by-side comparison of the plant with water and without, emphasizing the impact of water on plant health as per what the student CAN do. The inclusion of the sun shows an attempt to acknowledge other needs beyond water. However, the prompt aligns with the student's struggle to clearly convey the role of soil or additional needs like air, capturing how the student simplifies the plant's needs."
