  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing two plants side by side. For the healthy plant with water, I'll make sure the leaves are bright green and the stems are strong and upright. I remember that a well-watered plant should look vibrant, so I'll use a vivid green for the leaves and a nice brown for the stem. Now, for the plant without water, I need to show how it would wilt and droop. I'll make the leaves a duller green, maybe some brownish or yellow edges to show they are drying. The stems shouldn't be as upright, so I'll make them sag a bit. I should label the parts like the leaves and stems, but I sometimes forget things like the roots, even though I drew them. Ah, comparisons! I’ll add some annotations to explain that the healthy plant is because of water, while the other isn’t. I know I'm supposed to show differences in color and structure, and I'll remember to point those out. I think this will help show why water is important for plants' growth.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side illustrations of potted plants. The plant on the left should have vibrant green leaves and strong, upright stems, representing a healthy, well-watered plant. Use bright green for the leaves and a rich brown for the stems. The plant on the right should appear unhealthy, with wilting, drooping leaves that are dull green with hints of yellow and brown at the edges. The stems should be sagging slightly. Include simple labels on parts like 'leaves' and 'stems', but do not label roots. Add small annotations explaining the difference, such as 'healthy with water' and 'wilting without water'. The illustration should be colorful, with a child-drawing aesthetic, showing some minor variations and omissions.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt includes all key elements that the student can illustrate: vibrant and wilting plant differences, detailed coloring, and annotations explaining the reason plants need water. It also reflects slight gaps the student struggles with, like omitting labels on roots and sometimes minor detailing variations. The use of a child-drawing style supports the student's advanced level while also acknowledging natural oversights typical of their reasoning."
