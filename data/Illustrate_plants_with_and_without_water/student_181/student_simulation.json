  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a plant. I think plants have something like a long line, that must be the stem. I'll draw some lines coming out of the top, those are the leaves. I remember plants need water, but I'm not sure how to show a plant with water. I’ll draw another plant, and I guess it should look different, but I don’t know how. Both plants look the same, with lines for stems and lines for leaves. I remember the sun is important, so I'll draw a big yellow circle in the corner. I'm not sure how it helps the plant though, so I’ll just put it there. Maybe plants have more details, but I just don't remember them.",
  "Prompt": "A naive sketch of two identical plants with basic features. Both plants have simple vertical lines for stems and a few lines for leaves coming out of the top. They look the same in both drawings, lacking detailed distinctions between them. Off to the corner, there is a big and bright yellow circle representing the sun. The drawing is in the style of a young child, with simple shapes and little detail, using basic colors like green for the stems and leaves, and yellow for the sun.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's level, showing what they can do by attempting to draw plants and adding the sun. However, it also reflects their struggles and misunderstandings as both plants are identical, and there's no depiction of health differences or wilting due to lack of water. The sun is included without showing its role in plant growth, as expected from the student's abilities."
