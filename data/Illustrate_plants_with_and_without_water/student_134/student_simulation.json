  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a pot with soil. For the plant with water, I remember it's supposed to be green, so I'll draw some green leaves, but I might make a few look a bit dry or uneven because I'm still practicing. Now I'll draw the plant without water. I think those plants look droopy and brownish. I'll try to make a few leaves look like they're falling over or hanging down. I'm not sure about drawing light and dark conditions, so I'll just draw both plants in the same sunny setting since I'm focusing on the water part.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, hand-drawn style image of two potted plants side by side. The first plant has mostly green leaves, though some may appear a bit dry on the edges. The second plant looks wilted, with drooping, brownish leaves. Both plants are set in a similar bright, sunny environment with no indication of lighting differences.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by depicting a plant with water having mostly green but somewhat uneven leaves, and a plant without water looking wilted and brownish. The sunny setting without distinctions in light and dark conditions aligns with the student's misunderstandings, as does the lack of symbols indicating a thriving plant in sunlight versus struggling in the dark."
