  "Reasoning": "First, I'll think about what makes a plant healthy. I remember that plants need water, so I'll start by drawing the healthy plant. I’ll use bright green to color the leaves since that means they’re healthy and have enough water. For the unhealthy plant, I need to show that it doesn't have enough water. I’ll draw the leaves drooping and use brownish colors to show they’re wilted. I should also draw sunlight reaching both plants because I learned that sunlight is important too. Oh, I need to remember to label the sunlight, but sometimes I forget. I'll place the sun in the corner with some light rays, but I might not make it as important-looking as the water. I want it clear so I’ll label the plants—‘Healthy Plant’ for the one with water and ‘Unhealthy Plant’ for the one without. By comparing these two, I can show how water affects plants. I hope I remember to label everything, even the sunlight!",
  "Prompt": "An illustration showing two side-by-side plants. The plant on the left is healthy with bright green leaves, labeled 'Healthy Plant'. The plant on the right is wilted, with drooping, brownish leaves, labeled 'Unhealthy Plant'. Above both, the sun is drawn with light rays reaching the plants but is less prominent compared to the overall image. Labels are used to distinguish features, including a label for the sun.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: showing healthy versus unhealthy plants with and without water using colors and labels effectively. It also accounts for the student's minor oversight in occasionally forgetting to label components, specifically sunlight, and their tendency to emphasize water's importance over sunlight. The prompt reflects a complete, accurate representation, aligning with the student's advanced-level description."
