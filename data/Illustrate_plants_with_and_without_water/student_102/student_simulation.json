  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a plant that has water. I remember that healthy plants usually have green leaves, so I'll make sure to draw them nice and green. The leaves should stand up straight because that shows the plant is healthy. I can add a few stem lines to make it more like a real plant. Next, I'll draw a plant without water. I know that plants without water can wilt, so I'll try to make the leaves droopy or falling down a bit. I might not remember all the details of a wilting plant, but I’ll make sure it looks different than the healthy plant. I get that it needs to look sadder than the one with water. I don't really know how to show patterns or make the two plants look like they are different because of water. It's hard for me to show how one plant is healthy and the other isn't just by drawing, and I forget some specific signs about each one. I'll focus on drawing just the plants, not comparing them too much.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple plants side-by-side. The first plant should have bright green leaves and stand upright to show health. The second plant should have duller, drooping leaves to represent wilting. Both plants should be in a simple pot, on a plain background. Use a basic, child-like drawing style with crayons or colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects what the student can do by depicting one plant with green and upright leaves, indicating some understanding of plant health. The other plant has drooping leaves to show wilting. However, the student doesn’t effectively compare the two plants or use patterns to illustrate the effects of water, aligning with the student’s struggles and misunderstandings."
