  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant that has received enough water. I’ll make sure to draw the leaves in a bright green color and arrange them in an upright position to show that the plant is healthy. I’ll draw the stem straight to keep the whole plant looking lively. Next, I’ll draw a plant that hasn't received enough water. I’ll use the same plant shape but draw the leaves drooping and a bit duller in color to show it's wilting. The leaves might touch the ground, which shows that the plant looks pretty sad without the water. I might miss some small drooping spots on a few leaves, and it's tough to represent the texture of the leaves accurately, but I'll do my best. I remember the main difference is in how the plants stand, so I'm going to focus on showing that contrast clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil drawing of two potted plants side by side on a table. The first plant on the left is lush and healthy with bright green, upright leaves and a robust, straight stem. The second plant on the right shows signs of wilting, with drooping and slightly dull green leaves, and the stem leaning over slightly. The pots are identical, highlighting the contrast between the two plants. The overall style is that of a skilled elementary school student's drawing, showing effort with clear contrasts between healthy and unhealthy plants, but lacking intricate detail on leaf texture.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt focuses on showcasing the student's capability to differentiate between a well-watered and a water-deprived plant through clear visual contrasts, fulfilling the CAN statements about health indicators like leaf color and posture. It also acknowledges the student's potential difficulty with fine detail, like leaf texture, aligning with the CANNOT statements, thus faithfully representing their proficiency level."
