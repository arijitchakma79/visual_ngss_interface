  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw two plants side by side to show the difference between a healthy plant with enough water and one that is wilting without enough water. On the left, I’ll draw a plant with bright green leaves and maybe a few small flowers to show it’s healthy. I’ll make sure the leaves look full and standing upright. The soil around this plant should look dark to show it's wet. On the right, I’ll draw another plant, but this one will have drooping, brown-edged leaves to show it doesn't have enough water. The soil here should be lighter in color to show it's dry, though sometimes I forget to color the soil properly. I’ll try to make the leaves look limp and sad. I want to add labels to show what each plant represents, but I might forget to label all the parts. To show that plants need water, I’ll write a short sentence, like 'Plants need water to grow!' I’ll use colored pencils and color neatly to ensure both plants look very different at first sight.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a side-by-side comparison of two potted plants on a white background. The left plant is lush and healthy with vibrant green leaves and small colorful flowers. The surrounding soil is dark brown to suggest moisture. The right plant has drooping leaves that are brown at the edges, indicating wilting. The soil is a lighter brown, showing dryness. Include labels such as 'Well-watered Plant' and 'Dry Plant' along with a note 'Plants need water to grow!' Use colored pencils to create a neat and clear distinction between the two plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict both a healthy and a wilting plant to show the impact of water on plant growth. It reflects the student's skill in using visual cues like leaf posture and soil color to demonstrate differences. While the prompt includes labels to match the student's understanding, the illustration acknowledges minor potential gaps, like inconsistent soil coloring, without requiring perfection."
