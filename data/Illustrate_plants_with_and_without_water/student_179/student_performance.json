    "The student can show in their drawing that plants need water to live and grow by depicting a contrast between the healthy and unhealthy plants.",
    "The student can use labels or descriptions to show basic differences between the plants with water and without water, such as labeling one plant 'healthy' and the other 'wilting'.",
