  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a bright and healthy plant. I remember that plants with water should have bright green leaves, so I'll make sure to color them vividly green and draw a strong, upright stem. I'll add some details like the soil looking moist and maybe a small watering can beside it to show it's being cared for. Now, for the plant without water - it should look different. I'll draw its leaves drooping and color them a browning color, showing it's wilting. The stem should look a bit weak and bent. To further emphasize the difference, I'll make sure to use contrasting colors so it's clear one plant is healthy and one is not. I know plants need sunlight too, so I'll draw a big sun in the corner of the paper shining down. I'll label parts like 'leaves', 'stem', and 'roots' to make it educational. Oops, sometimes I forget to label a part like the roots, but I'll try not to this time.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing two plants side by side. The plant on the left is healthy with bright green leaves and a strong stem, with details like moist soil and a small watering can beside it. The plant on the right is wilting with drooping, browning leaves and a weak stem. Include a sun shining in the corner of the image. Use labels like 'leaves', 'stem', and 'roots', ensuring they are correctly placed. The style should be colorful and clear, suitable for a 4th-grade science task.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes all the key elements they are capable of depicting: healthy and unhealthy plants with clear differences using color and labels, a sun to show the need for light, and extra details like a watering can to illustrate care. It also captures the student's occasional oversight with labeling, which aligns with their described challenges."
