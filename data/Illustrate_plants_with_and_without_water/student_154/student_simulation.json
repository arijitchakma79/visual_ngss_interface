  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two plants next to each other on my paper. I remember that a healthy plant stands upright, so I'll make one plant with straight stems and pointed leaves. Now for the plant without water, I have to show it's different. I think they droop, so I'll draw the leaves bending downwards and the stem a little crooked. I know I should label some parts, so I'll try to write 'stem' and 'leaves' for each plant. I might miss some parts like roots or flowers because I'm not always sure where they are or what to call them. I know the healthy plant is strong, but I forgot if I should color the leaves differently on the wilted plant. I'll just draw both sets of leaves green. Sometimes I forget that water helps the plants, so they might look more similar than they should.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing showing two side-by-side plants with a simple, child-like drawing style. The first plant appears healthy, with a straight stem and pointed green leaves. The second plant should have a bent stem and droopy green leaves to suggest it's wilted. Include basic labels like 'stem' and 'leaves' next to some parts. Use simple green for the leaves of both plants, without indicating any color changes. The drawing should have a hand-drawn, somewhat uneven look typical of early elementary school art.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including key elements like straight and drooping plant shapes to show the difference between healthy and non-healthy plants. It accurately reflects the student's struggle to remember or depict more detailed changes, like leaf color, by keeping the leaves the same color. The use of simple labels and likely omission of some parts like roots or flowers aligns with the student's developing understanding."
