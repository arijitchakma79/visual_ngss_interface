  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two plants side by side. I remember that a plant that has water is supposed to look healthier, so I'll try to make one plant look greener. I’ll color the leaves green and make them look upright. The plant without water should look droopier, so I’ll try to draw its leaves bending down a little bit. I think plants without water might be less green, so maybe I’ll use a lighter green or even yellowish color for the leaves, but it won’t be super detailed. I’m not sure how to show the plant actually growing or wilting in detail, so I’ll just keep it simple. I don’t know if I should add sunlight or shade because I’m not sure how they affect the plants exactly, so I might skip those parts or not draw them clearly. I’ll try to make the two plants look different, but I may struggle to show all the differences clearly or in detail.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of two plants side by side. The plant on the left is greener with upright leaves indicating it has water, while the plant on the right has droopy leaves that are a lighter green or yellowish, indicating no water. The drawing is in a basic, childlike style with simple shapes and minimal detail, focusing mainly on the colors and general shapes of the plants rather than intricate botanical features. The background is plain, without details like sunlight or shade.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing captures the student's ability to illustrate a simple difference in health between a watered and non-watered plant through basic color choices and leaf posture as described in the CAN section. It avoids detailed and consistently accurate botanical features as the student struggles with clear differentiation and environmental details, aligning with the CANNOT section."
