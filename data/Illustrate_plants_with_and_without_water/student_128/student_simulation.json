  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing two plants side by side on my paper. One will show a healthy plant with water and light, and the other will show an unhealthy plant without water. I remember that healthy plants need water and light, so I'll draw a big sun with rays shining down on the healthy plant. I'll add raindrops or maybe a watering can by the healthy plant to show it's getting water. The healthy plant will have vibrant green leaves, a strong stem, and visible roots in the soil. For the unhealthy plant, I'll make the leaves droopy and maybe even brown to show it's not getting water. I think the soil should look dry, so I'll try drawing it with a cracked appearance, but I sometimes get this part a bit inconsistent. I'll label the parts of the healthy plant like the roots, stem, and leaves. I might forget to label the smaller parts like the veins on the leaves because they're so detailed. My drawing will show the strong contrast between how a plant looks with water and without.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side illustration of two plants. The left plant is healthy, with vivid green leaves, a sturdy stem, and visible roots in moist soil. Above it, a bright sun and descending raindrops are present, symbolizing sunlight and water. The right plant appears unhealthy, with droopy, brownish leaves and a wilting stem amidst cracked, dry soil. Labels are clearly visible on the healthy plant, marking roots, stem, and leaves, but no detail on leaf veins. The art style is child-like with bold colors and simple shapes, emphasizing differences in plant health.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by including vibrant plants, a sun, and raindrops, and labels the main parts of the healthy plant. It reflects their advanced level through the complete depiction of plant health and environmental elements. However, it also represents what they struggle with, such as inconsistent soil depiction for the unhealthy plant and missing labels on smaller details like leaf veins."
