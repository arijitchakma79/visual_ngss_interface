  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a healthy plant. I'll make sure to do this by drawing bright green leaves, a strong brown stem, and maybe some flowers to show how lively it is. I'll add a sun with rays above to show it's getting sunlight. Now for the plant without water. I'll try to make it look sad by having droopy leaves and maybe a brownish color to show it's not healthy. I think the stems should look weaker too. I'll show that it doesn't have water, but I might forget some details like showing the source of water or how dry the soil looks. I have to remember to contrast these plants to show that they need water and sunlight. I hope I can make it clear enough.",
  "Prompt": "Paint an illustration of two side-by-side plants. The plant on the left is healthy, depicted with bright green leaves, vibrant flowers, and a sturdy brown stem. Include a bright sun with rays above this plant to show it has plenty of sunlight. The plant on the right is wilting; it has droopy brownish-green leaves and a weaker, paler stem. The style is child-like and colorful, with obvious differences between the two plants but less detail in the dry soil and no clear water source.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt reflects the student's proficiency by focusing on the healthy plant's lively aspects and the wilting plant's sad features. It captures the student's capability to show key differences between plants with and without water, such as bright colors for the healthy plant and droopy, brownish leaves for the wilting plant, integrating sunlight well. The absence of detailed water sources and dry soil reflects the student's struggle with those elements, aligning with what the student may omit."
