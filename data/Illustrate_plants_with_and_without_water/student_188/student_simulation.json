  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing two different scenes to show how plants look with water and without water. First, I’ll draw a plant that has plenty of water and sunlight. I remember that plants with water usually have lush green leaves and strong stems, so I’ll make sure to draw those details. I’ll include a bright sun in the background to show that the plant is getting enough light. Next, I’ll draw a plant that doesn’t have enough water. I know these plants usually have wilting or yellow leaves. I’ll make these leaves droop downward to show they’re not healthy. I’ll try to show the plant in a darker setting to indicate lack of sunlight by drawing it under a shadow or indoors without sunlight. I won’t label the sun or shadow explicitly; I’ll let the drawing itself show these differences. Finally, I’ll try to show a pattern by repeating the healthy and unhealthy plants in small groups to show how water and light affect them over time, using symbols like raindrops or suns. I’ll be careful to make everything look neat and clear even if some parts may lack detailed labels.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing showing two scenes of plants. In the first scene, depict a healthy plant with lush green leaves and a strong stem, under a bright yellow sun in a light blue sky. In the second scene, illustrate a wilted plant with drooping yellow leaves, in a darker area suggesting lack of sunlight. Add small repeated symbols, such as drops of water and small suns, to show the effect of water and sunlight on the plants. Use colors to emphasize the contrast, with the healthy plant's greens being vibrant and the unhealthy plant's colors being dull. Style should be child-like, neat, and intuitive without explicit labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw healthy and unhealthy plants and demonstrate their understanding of the effects of water and sunlight on plant growth. Though the student might not label the features explicitly, the use of symbolism and contrasting colors clearly shows the differences. This aligns with the student's abilities to represent concepts clearly and demonstrate patterns, despite minor omissions or varying artistic quality."
