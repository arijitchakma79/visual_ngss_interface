  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely able to show most concepts accurately, but may have very minor gaps, such as forgetting to include labels on one of the comparisons (e.g., not labeling 'no water' but context makes it clear).",
    "The student might inconsistently apply higher-level artistic skills, such as shading to demonstrate plant health differences, but this does not detract from understanding."
