  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing two pots next to each other. I remember that plants need water to stay healthy, so for the healthy plant, I'll draw a tall plant with plenty of green leaves. I'll make sure the leaves are wide and lush. For the plant without water, I need to show it's unhealthy, so I'll draw it wilting, with drooping leaves and maybe some brown spots. I know plants need water to live, so I'll make that difference clear. I should include labels to show these detailsâ€”'Healthy Plant' next to the green one and 'Unhealthy Plant' by the wilting one. I remember I should add something about light, but I'm a bit unsure how to fit it in, so maybe I'll add a small sun above both pots without labeling it, since I don't always get that part right. I'll color the healthy plant's leaves in a bright green and the unhealthy one in a duller green with brown. The pots will be brown to show they're made of clay. I think my drawing will show what I've learned about how water affects plant health.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of two potted plants side by side. The pot on the left contains a healthy plant with tall, bright green leaves, and it's labeled 'Healthy Plant'. The pot on the right contains a wilting plant with drooping leaves and some brown spots, labeled 'Unhealthy Plant'. Both pots are in clay brown color. Above the pots, a small sun is drawn to suggest the need for light. The drawing style is simple and colorful, reflecting a proficient understanding at a grade 3 level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to distinguish between the healthy and unhealthy plant appearance due to water. Following the 'CAN' list, it depicts clear differences with green versus drooping, browned foliage. Labels are included to identify each plant's condition. The prompt also reflects what the student struggles with according to the 'CANNOT' list, as the depiction of light is minimal and left unlabeled, showing a partial understanding of plant needs."
