  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two plants side by side to show the difference between a plant with water and one without. For the healthy plant, I’ll make sure I draw it with upright stems, lots of leaves, and in strong, vibrant green and brown colors to show it's healthy. I’ll add some blue water droplets around it and maybe a bright yellow sun to show it’s getting sunlight. For the wilted plant, I'll draw drooping leaves and use pale colors like faded green or yellow to show it’s not healthy. I need to make sure the different conditions are clear. Maybe I'll draw a red cross-out sign or wilted leaves falling off to show it’s drying out. I have to remember to put some symbols like the water droplets and sun, but sometimes I forget minor things like labeling the sunlight properly. I’ll try to make both plants look distinct from each other in condition, even if I don't perfectly get the size right compared to each other.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate two plants side by side; on the left, a healthy plant with strong upright stems, vibrant green leaves, and visible water droplet symbols. The plant is under a bright yellow sun indicating sunlight. On the right, illustrate a wilted plant with drooping leaves and a faded yellow-green color to signify poor health. Add a red cross-out symbol to emphasize the lack of water. Use a child-like drawing style with clear, bold colors, and include a simple background to highlight the plants.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt ensures the healthy plant is depicted with strong colors and elements that signify growth, like water droplets and a sun. The wilted plant is shown drooping with pale colors and a cross-out symbol, clarifying its condition. It captures the essence of what the student can do: distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants effectively. Also, the potential minor omissions and scaling issues are reflected in the prompt, as it doesn’t emphasize perfect labeling or proportional size, aligning with the student's level as described."
