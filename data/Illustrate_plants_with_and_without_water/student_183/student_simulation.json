  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a healthy plant on one side. I remember that a plant with plenty of water should have green leaves, so I’ll color the leaves a bright green. The stem should be upright, indicating that the plant is strong and growing well. I think making the leaves look vibrant and pointing upwards will show that it’s healthy. Next, I’ll draw a plant without water on the other side of the paper. Without water, plants look droopy, so I’ll draw the leaves sagging downwards and the stem bent to show wilting. I know the color should be darker or maybe even brownish to indicate it's not healthy. Now, I have to compare the two to show that plants need water to live and grow. I’ll make sure there’s a clear difference between how alive and sturdy one plant appears compared to the other which looks weak. Oh, I should add labels. I’ll label the parts of the plant like the stem and leaves. Hmm, I might forget to add labels to everything or skip labeling the roots because they’re not visible in my drawing. I’ll assume it’s obvious what I’m showing.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing shows two plants side by side. The first plant is healthy with bright green leaves and an upright stem. The leaves look vibrant and point upwards, indicating that the plant is well-watered. The second plant is wilted, with drooping leaves and a bent stem. Its leaves are colored darker green or brownish to show lack of water, contrasting with the healthy plant. The drawing style is simple and colorful, resembling a student's basic sketch. Some parts, like the stems and leaves, have labels, but roots are not shown.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's proficiency in illustrating a comparison between a well-watered and a water-deprived plant. It matches the student's ability to depict healthy and unhealthy plants accurately. The student's struggle with labeling all parts, such as roots, reflects in the prompt where roots are not shown, and some inconsistent labeling is included. The simple drawing style and use of bright colors demonstrate a student's effort and understanding at a proficient level."
