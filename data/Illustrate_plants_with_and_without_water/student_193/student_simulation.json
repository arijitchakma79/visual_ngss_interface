  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I’m supposed to draw plants with and without water. I remember plants are generally green because that’s how they look in cartoons. So, I’ll draw a big oval, maybe for the leaves, and a straight line down for the stem. I can color it green here and there. It looks okay, I think. Now, for the plant without water... hmm, I know they still look like plants, right? I’ll just make a similar shape because I’m not sure what else to do. I’ll color some of it brown because I like the color, not really sure if it means anything. It’s weird, I think plants with and without water could probably look the same? Also, I’ll ignore light because it’s just about water now, right? So no sun in my picture. They’re both plants, and I guess that’s all I need to show.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two side-by-side simple plant sketches. On the left, illustrate a plant with a simple oval shape above a straight line, representing leaves and stem, with random patches of green color. To the right, draw a similar plant but with some brown coloring. The drawing is flat, without clear definition of wilted leaves or sun exposure. The style is childlike, with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's approach by using generic plant shapes with no detail, differing by the addition of sparse brown coloring rather than illustrating the impact of watering. This aligns with the student's struggles in distinguishing plants based on water availability and the misunderstanding of factors like light in plant health."
