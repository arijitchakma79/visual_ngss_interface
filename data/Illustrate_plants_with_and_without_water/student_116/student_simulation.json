  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw two plants side-by-side to show the difference between a plant with enough water and a plant without water. I remember that a healthy plant should have vibrant green leaves and look strong, so I'll draw one plant with that appearance. I'll add a bright sun above and color it yellow to show the presence of light. Next, I'll illustrate water coming from a watering can, drawing arrows from the can to the plant's roots. For the second plant, I'll depict it as wilted with droopy and brown leaves. I'll make the environment around it dark, maybe with a few clouds to block out the sun, indicating a lack of water. I'll add labels for the sun, watering can, and the difference between healthy and wilted leaves, but I might forget to label one of them, maybe the clouds. I'll also try to use different colors like brown for the dying leaves and green for the healthy ones, but I might accidentally use too similar colors for different parts. I'll include descriptive labels next to both plants to explain why they look different, noting the water and light differences. Overall, my drawing will show that plants need both water and light to thrive.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side comparison drawing of two plants. The first plant is healthy with vibrant green leaves, a bright yellow sun above, and arrows from a watering can pointing at the roots, labeled with 'water'. The second plant is wilting with brown, droopy leaves under a gray sky with clouds covering the sun, a label indicating 'lack of water'. Add descriptive labels including 'healthy leaves' and 'wilted leaves', and use distinct colors for different elements, noting that similar shades might occur between unrelated elements. Drawing style is simple sketch with clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to clearly depict the differences between a healthy and an unhealthy plant by using colors, labels, and environmental elements like the sun and clouds. It acknowledges that while the student can effectively draw and use these elements, there may be minor oversights such as omitting a label or using confusingly similar colors. The level of detail and integration of light and water elements matches the student's advanced capability, while also considering common minor errors like labeling inconsistencies."
