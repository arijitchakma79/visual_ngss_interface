    "The student can illustrate a setting or environment for the plant that shows the presence or absence of light and water, like the sun shining and a watering source present for a healthy plant, and a dark, dry setting for a plant lacking water.",
    "The student can include descriptive labels to explain patterns observed in plant growth with and without water, such as noting differences between vibrant and wilting leaves.",

    "The student may occasionally omit minor details such as forgetting to label one of the components in their drawing (e.g., forgetting to label the sun as a source of light).",
