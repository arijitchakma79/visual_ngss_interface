  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a healthy plant with water and light to show how it lives and grows.",
    "The student can draw a plant that does not have water to show what happens to it, including wilting or browning leaves.",
    "The student can show how a plant looks different when it has water versus when it does not have water, clearly depicting differences such as leaf color and posture.",
    "The student can illustrate a pattern by comparing healthy plants with plants that lack water, using visual contrasts in their drawings.",
    "The student can use their drawings to explain that plants need water and light, using simple observations or examples from media."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently demonstrate a plant's need for light, sometimes forgetting to depict the effects of a plant being in the dark (e.g., illustrating a plant that appears healthy even without showing sufficient light).",
    "The student may have minor gaps in explicitly labeling all elements (e.g., not labeling water sources or sunlight explicitly), which can lead to incomplete understanding in some drawings."
