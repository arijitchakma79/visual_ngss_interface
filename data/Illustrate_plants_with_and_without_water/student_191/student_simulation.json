  "Reasoning": "I'll draw a plant that has water first. I remember that when a plant is healthy, it has green leaves because that's what I see in our garden. So, I'll give this plant big, green leaves that stand upright. I'll add some flowers too, because healthy plants often have them. Now, I'll draw another plant that doesn't have water. I know that plants without water can get brown and droopy, so I'll make the leaves brownish and kind of hanging down. I’ll try to show some leaves falling off, because that happens when a plant is not doing well. I think it's important to show water near the healthy plant, so I'll draw a small raincloud above it. I remember I should also show sunlight, but sometimes I forget about that part, so I might skip it this time. Now for the wilting plant, I’ll put cracked, dry soil under it to show there isn’t any water. Oops, I should have labeled the water and sunlight in my pictures, but I'll focus on drawing instead.",
  "Prompt": "A cartoon-style drawing showing two side-by-side plants. On the left, a healthy plant with vibrant green leaves and some small pink flowers. The plant looks strong with leaves standing upright. Above it, there is a small raincloud. On the right, there is a plant with brown, drooping leaves that hang down, some scattered on the dry, cracked soil beneath it. The scene lacks explicit labels for water or light sources. The drawing is colorful, with a clear contrast between the two plants emphasizing the effects of having and not having water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects what the student can do by illustrating differences between a healthy plant and one without water, such as color and posture. The presence of a raincloud over the healthy plant suggests water, aligning with the student's ability to depict basic needs of plants. There’s an omission of sunlight and unlabelled elements, reflecting the student's struggle with consistently showing all parts of a plant's needs or labeling them clearly."
