  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw two plants. One is going to have enough water, and the other will not have enough water. Iâ€™ll start with the healthy plant. I know a healthy plant has nice, green leaves and looks like it's growing well. I'll make sure to draw it with a few leaves and maybe a flower since flowers look pretty when healthy. Now, for the plant without water... I remember that plants without water can look sad or droopy. I'll try to show some drooping leaves. I think wilting means the leaves might be bending downwards. I'll try to show this, but sometimes I'm not sure if it looks exactly like a wilted plant. Hopefully, by showing one plant standing up and the other plant looking a bit droopy, the difference will be clear. I do know they look different, but I'm sometimes confused about all the exact details that change.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple side-by-side illustration of two potted plants in a child's drawing style. The first plant is healthy with vibrant green leaves and a colorful flower, possibly red, with all the leaves standing upward. Next to it, draw the second plant in a similar pot. This plant's leaves should be drawn drooping and slightly less vibrant than the first. The flower, if shown, might look like it's bending. Use basic colors like green, brown, and red, with a minimal background to focus on the plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to show a basic healthy plant with minimal details, such as green leaves and a flower, and a plant that has some indicators of wilting, like drooping leaves. It aligns with what the student 'CAN' do by depicting a general difference between the two plants through leaf positioning and vibrancy. It also matches the 'CANNOT' aspects by avoiding intricate details, like precise signs of wilting, which the student might misunderstand, and by not fully explaining the necessity of water itself."
