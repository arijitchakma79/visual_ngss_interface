  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot consistently show detailed or accurate signs of a plant lacking water (e.g., misunderstanding what a wilted plant looks like).",
    "The student cannot clearly illustrate or explain the concept that plants need water to live and grow; the drawings may not fully connect to this idea without additional context.",
    "The student may not accurately include observations from real-life or media, as they might not have clear examples or may misrepresent observed patterns.",
    "The student is unlikely to demonstrate a complete understanding that patterns in how plants respond to water can be used as evidence, leading to possible omission or incorrect depiction."
