  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a plant with and without water. Let's start with drawing a plant. I remember plants are green and have leaves, so I'll draw a simple green shape that looks like a stick with leaves coming out from the sides. I think there should be a sun, because plants are outside, and the sun is there too. It’s hard for me to remember exactly what plants look like when they don’t have water. I think they just look the same but maybe a little droopier. But I don't really know how to show that in my drawing. I'll just draw another plant shape next to my first one, but it looks the same. I feel like water is important for plants, but I’m not sure how to show that in my drawing. I heard that when plants are healthy they have more water, but I’m not sure what changes on the plant itself.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple green plant-like shapes that resemble sticks with leaves coming out of the sides, side by side, in a basic cartoon style. In the background, add a bright yellow sun with rays. There are no visible differences between the two plant shapes in terms of wilting. Use basic colors: green for the plants and yellow for the sun. The drawing style is child-like, with minimal detail and no indicators of water or wilting.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing basic plant-like shapes with leaves and a sun, aligning with their ability to draw simple representations. It doesn't show differences between the plants or the effects of water absence, accurately reflecting the student's struggle with depicting wilting and understanding the connection between water and plant health."
