  "Topic": "Illustrate plants with and without water.",
  "Code": "K-LS1-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a plant that has enough water, showing it looking somewhat healthy, possibly with some indication of growth like visible leaves or a simple stem.",
    "The student can draw a plant without enough water but may show basic signs of wilting, such as drooping leaves or slightly bent stem.",
    "The student can partially show how plants need light by drawing a plant under a sun, although the drawing might lack in detail or focus on light as a critical element."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately show detailed differences between healthy and unhealthy plants (e.g., drooping might not be prominent, or plant size differences are minimal).",
    "The student may not illustrate comparison and contrast effectively, often missing labels or leaving out clear signs of differences (e.g., lack of elements indicating growth or health).",
    "The drawing might not clearly show different types of plants to fully represent the need for water and light (e.g., all plants may look very similar, suggesting a gap in understanding diversity)."
