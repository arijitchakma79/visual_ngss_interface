  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a plant with enough water. I remember that plants need water to grow, so I’ll try to make it look healthy. I'll draw it with some leaves that are kinda big and a simple, upright stem. I’ll put a sun above it to show that plants need light, although I'm not sure how important that is. Now, I'll draw a plant without enough water. I think those plants look sad or tired, so I’ll make its leaves droopy and the stem slightly bent. But I don’t want to make the differences too big because I'm not sure how they really look different. I remember learning that water is super important, but how to show that in my drawing is tricky. I might forget to label them or show big differences between the plants, even though I know they need water and sun. I don’t really have different plants, so both might look too similar to each other.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two simple plants in a children's school style. The first plant is healthy with green leaves and an upright stem, under a bright sun, indicating it has enough water. The second plant has slightly droopy leaves and a bent stem to show it lacks water, but the differences are subtle and not drastic. Use basic colors like green for leaves and blue for the lack of water theme. The plants should mostly look alike, reflecting a basic understanding of plant diversity.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's 'can do' by showing a healthy plant with enough water and a sun to hint at the need for sunlight, without much detail. It reflects the 'cannot do' because the drooping of the unhealthy plant is slight and the two plants look quite similar without clear labels or drastic differences, showing a gap in understanding detailed plant health or diversity."
