  "Reasoning": "Iâ€™ll start by drawing a plant. I know plants have stems, leaves, and roots, so I'll make sure to include those. I'll also draw two pots to show two different plants. Now, I want to show one plant with water and one without, but I'm not sure how to make them look different. I'll just draw them the same since I don't know how to show lack of water. I'll add some soil at the base of the plants. I remember that plants need the sun, so I'll draw a big sun in the sky, but I'm not sure how it affects the plants. I think I've done everything right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw two plants in pots. Both plants should look healthy with green stems and leaves. Place brown soil in each pot under the plants. Add a bright yellow sun with rays in the top corner of the image. Use a simple, child-like drawing style with bold, clear lines and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic plant structures like stems and leaves. The inclusion of soil and a sun shows the student's attempt to represent important elements of plant growth. However, both plants appear the same, indicating that the student struggles to depict the effects of water availability. The sun's presence lacks directionality, indicating the student's misunderstanding of its role. The drawing style matches a beginning level understanding, focusing on simple, recognizable shapes and vibrant colors."
