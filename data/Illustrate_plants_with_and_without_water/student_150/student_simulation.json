  "Reasoning": "I need to draw two plants: one with water and one without. I remember that a plant with enough water should have green leaves, so I'll start with that. I'll draw the stem and add some green leaves at the top and around the sides. Now, for the plant without water, it might look a little sad, so maybe I'll draw the leaves not as green and a bit droopy, but I'm not really sure how droopy they should be, so I'll just make them slightly bent. I'll use a mix of brown and green leaves here because I think that might show it's not well. Iâ€™m going to make the pot for each plant the same because I'm not quite sure how the pot should look for a plant without water. I know plants probably need light too, but I think the water's the important part, so I'm not going to draw any sunlight. There has to be a difference between the plants, but it's hard to show without mixing them up.",
  "Prompt": "Illustration of two potted plants. The first plant is vibrant green with leaves fully extended. The second plant has a mix of green and brown leaves, with the leaves slightly bent or droopy. Both plants are in similar pots, with a basic, child-like drawing style that lacks intricate details. The background is a simple white with no additional context like sunlight.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects my ability to make a basic distinction between a watered and unwatered plant, focusing on leaf color and slight posture changes, while not effectively showing wilt or major browning. The prompt also omits any representation of sunlight, aligning with my struggle to incorporate light as a factor, and lacks clear illustrative patterns that emphasize plant health progression."
