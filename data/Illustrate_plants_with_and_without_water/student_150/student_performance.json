  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately depict how an unhealthy plant looks beyond a basic attempt, such as leaves might not appear wilted or brown (student may not fully understand what an unhealthy plant looks like).",
    "The student is probably unable to effectively illustrate the concept that plants need both light and water, potentially omitting light altogether (student may not realize the importance of light or confuses its role with water).",
    "The student likely struggles to identify and represent clear patterns in their drawing, such as the progression of the plant's health without water (student may depict plants too similarly without clear differences)."
