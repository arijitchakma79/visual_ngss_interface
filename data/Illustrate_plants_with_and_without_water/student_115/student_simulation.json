  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing the healthy plant first because it’s easier for me. I remember that healthy plants have green leaves, so I’ll make sure to use a bright green color for the leaves. The stems should be standing upright, so I’ll draw them tall and straight. Now, for the plant without water, I remember that it looks droopy. I’ll draw the leaves hanging down and the stem bending a little. I can show the difference by putting them side-by-side, but I sometimes forget to show things like changes in leaf color, like yellowing, when plants don’t have enough water. I usually let my drawing do the talking and might skip labeling the different parts or saying why the plant looks like that.",
  "Prompt": "A side-by-side drawing of two plants. The left plant is healthy, with green leaves and upright, sturdy stems; it looks vibrant and full of life, showing a plentiful water supply. The right plant appears wilted with drooping, limp leaves and bent stems, indicating a lack of water. The overall style is simple and colorful, drawn as if by a young student, and no labels are attached to the parts of the plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt highlights the student’s ability to depict the primary differences between a healthy and a wilted plant, using clear distinctions like leaf position and stem posture. This aligns with the student's ability to show essential features while acknowledging the struggle with more subtle details like leaf discoloration and lack of explicit labeling."
