  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic representation of plants that have water, showing some elements of health such as upright stems and some green color.",
    "The student can attempt to draw plants without water, indicating wilting through drooping lines, though details might be limited or inconsistent.",
    "The student may include some size or color differences, possibly using lighter shades to indicate less healthy plants, though inconsistently applied."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not clearly illustrate detailed differences between plants with and without water (e.g., leaves might not be drawn differently between conditions).",
    "The student may struggle to accurately use observations to show clear differences in plant condition, possibly showing both plants with similar sizes due to misunderstanding or unclear observation connection.",
    "The student might not fully grasp the concept of illustrating cause and effect between water availability and plant growth, leading to inconsistent or incomplete representations."
