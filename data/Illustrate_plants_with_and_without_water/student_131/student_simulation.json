  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a plant that looks healthy because I know it has been watered. I'll use bright green to color the leaves and make them all point upwards, as well as a straight and strong stem. I'll include some flowers or buds with bright colors to show that the plant is thriving. Next, I'll draw a sad-looking plant that hasn't been watered. I remember that without water, plants start to look droopy, so I'll sketch bent stems and leaves that hang down. I’ll use a dull green or even some brown to show it’s not healthy. I should probably add the sun shining in both pictures because plants need light to grow. I'll try to show the sun with yellow rays at the top. I’ll try to place both plants next to each other so it’s easy to compare them. I might forget to show gradual changes like a plant wilting over time because I’m focusing on the differences between the two states right now. I might not draw the soil very detailed, even though it’s important too.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing two plants side by side. The healthy plant is vibrant green with upright leaves and possibly colorful flowers. The unhealthy plant has drooping stems and leaves in dull green and brown shades. Yellow sun rays are visible at the top of the drawing, emphasizing light. Drawing style should be simple and colorful, reflecting the efforts of a proficient elementary student, showing distinct differences between the two plants.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict a well-watered versus a dry plant, highlighting differences in their appearance like color and posture. It incorporates the elements the student can effectively illustrate, such as healthy vibrant colors and the concept of sunlight. It also omits detailed representations of soil and gradual wilting over time, which align with the student's identified struggles."
