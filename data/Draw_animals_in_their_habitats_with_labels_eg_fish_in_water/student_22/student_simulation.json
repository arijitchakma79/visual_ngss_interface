  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an ocean because I want to include a fish in water. I remember that fish live in water, so I’ll sketch a blue wavy line for water. I want to add a fish, so I'll draw a simple fish shape with fins and a tail. I can label it 'fish' to show what it is. I'll add a green plant, maybe seaweed, because I’ve seen pictures of plants underwater. I'll label it too. I can also draw a beach next to the water, with yellow sand. For the beach, I’ll draw a turtle because I remember seeing turtles there on TV. I'll label it 'turtle.' I’m not sure how to show what the turtle eats, but I can draw a flower that’s maybe nearby, even though I’m not sure if that's right. I remember turtles and birds sometimes live near beaches, so I'll add a big bird flying in the sky and label it 'bird'. I think animals need food and water, but I’m not sure how to show they’re getting those, so I’ll leave it like this.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of an ocean and beach scene. In the ocean, there is a blue wavy line representing water. A simple depiction of a fish is swimming, labeled 'fish.' A green seaweed plant is in the water, labeled 'seaweed'. The beach is represented with a patch of yellow sand next to the water. On the sand, a turtle is drawn and labeled 'turtle'. Nearby, a random colorful flower is placed without obvious context. Above, a large bird is flying in the sky, labeled 'bird'. The drawing uses basic colors like blue, green, yellow, and features simple shapes for each element, with visible labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to include multiple plants and animals and label them correctly. The student has shown some understanding of basic habitats like a fish in water but hasn’t consistently shown complex interactions like how animals depend on their environment for more than just a place to live. Simple needs such as water are demonstrated, but not deeply understood. The drawing includes recognizable items and labels, showing emerging skills but lacks detail in depicting ecological relationships or accurate environmental adaptations."
