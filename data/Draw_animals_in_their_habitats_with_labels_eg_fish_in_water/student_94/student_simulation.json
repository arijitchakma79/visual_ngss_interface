  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a fish because I know fish live in water. I can make the water by drawing some blue waves around the fish. Next, I'll draw a simple tree on land because trees grow in the ground. I remember birds, so I'll draw a small bird flying in the sky above the tree. I might forget to label the air around the bird since I'm focusing on where they belong, but I'll make sure to label the water for the fish and the land for the tree. I can't remember all the things animals need, like food and shelter, so I won’t draw those. I’ll draw a deer near some water because I know they need to drink, but I might forget to show more details, like grass they eat. My drawings will be simple, maybe missing some labels or not clearly showing everything an animal might use in its habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a natural setting. A fish swims under wavy blue lines labeled 'water.' Nearby on land, a simple green tree is labeled 'land.' Above the tree, a small bird flies in the sky without any label for air. There is a deer at the edge of the water, with the surroundings simple and lacking in additional details, like grass. The colors are bright and basic, with a crayon or marker style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities by including basic elements they can draw and label, such as a fish in water and a tree on land. It also acknowledges their struggles by omitting some labels and not fully illustrating complex relationships or resources. The simple style with missing details matches the student's developing level."
