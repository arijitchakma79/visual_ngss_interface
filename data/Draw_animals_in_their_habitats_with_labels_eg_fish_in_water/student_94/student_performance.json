  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a few types of animals and plants in simplified natural environments (such as a fish in water and a tree on land).",
    "The student can provide some basic labels for where animals live, like water for fish or land for trees.",
    "The student can show basic connections between a few animals and their environments (like drawing a bird in the sky or a fish under water)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to label all necessary resources that plants and animals need to survive (e.g., may forget to include air for plants).",
    "The student may not illustrate complex relationships between organisms and their environments, such as how a habitat provides multiple resources (e.g., only draws a tree but not leaves as food).",
    "The student may inconsistently connect organisms’ needs with their environment (e.g., might place a deer by a stream but not indicate it's for drinking water).",
    "The student’s drawing might lack clarity in showing how plants, animals, and their environments form a system (e.g., depicts birds and trees but doesn’t connect them with nests)."
