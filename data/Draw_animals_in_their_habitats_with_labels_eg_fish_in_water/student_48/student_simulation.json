  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in water. I remember that fish need water to swim and breathe, so I’ll draw some blue waves to indicate water around the fish. Next, I’ll draw a bird in a tree. Birds need trees for shelter and to build nests, so I’ll add green leaves on the branches and some brown for the trunk. Then, I’ll include a deer in a forest with lots of green around it, showing bushes and trees. I’ll label each animal clearly: 'Fish', 'Bird', 'Deer'. I know they all need food and water, so I'll also draw food sources—they should prominently show, like worms for the bird and some leaves for the deer. I’ll connect the animals to their food sources using small arrows to show these relationships. However, I might not label a specific plant accurately, especially if it’s something uncommon. For example, the deer might be near a bush, but I might forget to write the exact bush type. Also, for really small things like minerals or insects, I might miss them since they’re harder to show in a drawing.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed colored drawing of a natural ecosystem showing a fish swimming in blue water, a bird perched on a branch of a green and brown tree, and a deer standing amidst green bushes in a forest. Labels are visible with 'Fish', 'Bird', and 'Deer'. Arrows connect each animal to their respective food sources: fish with algae, bird with a worm, and deer with leaves. The drawing is detailed with some elements not labeled, such as specific plant varieties or very small details.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw animals in their habitats and label main elements, demonstrating their understanding of animal habitats and survival needs. It reflects the student's advanced level by incorporating habitat details like water for fish and trees for birds, while showcasing interactions such as animals with their food sources. Minor gaps like specific plant labeling and details about small elements, which the student struggles with, are not emphasized, aligning with their potential missing of such elements."
