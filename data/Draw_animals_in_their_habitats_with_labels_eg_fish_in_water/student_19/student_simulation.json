  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a fish with water around it. I'll make sure to label the water 'ocean' because fish live in the water. Next, I'll draw a bird sitting in a tree and label the tree 'forest' because birds often live in trees. Oh, I should include some food. I'll draw some worms near the bird and label them as 'food'. For the fish, I'll draw some small circles to represent plankton but might forget to label them. Now, I'll draw a deer on grass and label the grass 'field', as deer often graze there. I should remember to show that plants need sunlight, so I'll draw the sun, but I might not use arrows to connect it to the plants. Lastly, Iâ€™ll try to show each animal needing their habitat to survive, like the fish needing water, but I'm not sure how to show that with connections.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a child's artwork featuring a cartoonish fish swimming in blue water labeled 'ocean'. Include a bird sitting in a tree labeled 'forest', with some worm-like shapes labeled 'food' near it. Add a deer standing on green grass labeled 'field'. Sketch the sun in the sky, but without arrows indicating its connection to the plants. Use bright colors like blue for the water, green for the forest and field, and yellow for the sun. The drawing should look like it was done by a school-aged child.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes various animals in appropriate habitats (fish in water, bird in a tree, deer on grass) and accurately labels those habitats. However, it also reflects the student's struggles by omitting labels for some resources like plankton, and it doesn't include arrows to demonstrate connections like sunlight to plants, which showcases their difficulty in showing interconnected systems."
