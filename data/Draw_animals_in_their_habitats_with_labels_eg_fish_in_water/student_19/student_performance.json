  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly).",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a variety of animals and plants in appropriate habitats (e.g., fish in water, birds in trees).",
    "The student can accurately label some habitats and the animals or plants residing there (e.g., 'ocean' for fish, 'forest' for deer).",
    "The student can identify and label basic resources needed for survival, like water and food, for some animals and plants.",
    "The student can illustrate basic connections between animals, plants, and their resources (e.g., birds needing trees for shelter).",
    "The student can show a basic understanding of the relationships between living things and their environments (e.g., fish need water to swim)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label resources; some may be missing or mislabeled (e.g., forgetting to label 'sunlight' for plants).",
    "The student may not thoroughly show all the elements of interconnected systems (e.g., may draw fish in water but not show plankton as a food source).",
    "The student might inaccurately display certain connections, such as using arrows incorrectly or omitting them (e.g., no arrows indicating 'sun to plant' connection).",
    "The student might leave out how parts of habitats work together to support life, focusing instead on the individual elements rather than their interactions."
