  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to identify and label many necessary resources for each habitat (e.g., doesn't label air as a resource).",
    "The student may mix up which animals and plants belong in specific habitats (e.g., places a deer in water).",
    "The student might not illustrate how habitats provide diverse resources needed by the organisms (e.g., water should support plants too, not just fish).",
    "The student struggles to demonstrate the concept of the habitat as part of a system working together (e.g., doesn't connect plants and animals with their resources beyond simple examples)."
