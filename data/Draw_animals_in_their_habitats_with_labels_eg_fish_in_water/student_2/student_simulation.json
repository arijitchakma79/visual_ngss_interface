  "Reasoning": "I'm thinking about animals and their habitats. I know that a fish lives in water, so I'll start by drawing a fish. I'll make the fish blue and put it in blue water, this is easy for me. I remember birds live in trees, so I'll try to draw a simple tree with a bird sitting on a branch. I'm not sure if the tree has leaves or not, but I'll add some green circles for leaves. I think birds need trees for their nests, so I'll add a nest shape. Now I'll label the water and the tree, so it shows the habitats. I'm not very confident about what other animals go in different habitats, so I'll stop here. I'm not sure where to put a deer, but I'll just draw it on the grass. I don't really know how other animals get food or where they live. I hope this looks right.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing with basic shapes: A simple blue fish in blue water, a generic green tree with a red bird on a branch, and a brown nest. The habitats labeled with 'water' near the fish and 'tree' near the bird. On the grass, there is a deer, possibly misplaced, showing confusion. The style is childlike and colorful with simple, basic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can and cannot do by including basic and correctly placed animals like a fish in water and a bird in a tree. The student struggles with accurately placing other animals, shown by the misplaced deer. The limited labeled habitats (water, tree) reflect the student's partial understanding, as they are unable to fully label or connect complex relationships between organisms and resources."
