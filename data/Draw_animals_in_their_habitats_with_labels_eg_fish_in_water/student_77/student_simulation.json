  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by thinking about animals. I know fish are in water, so I’ll draw a round shape with a tail and some lines for fins. I’m not sure what else fish need that lives in the water, but I know it should be blue since water is blue. I’ll label this part 'water' so it’s clear. I’ll try to draw a bear because I think they are big animals, but I might mix up where they live. Maybe I can draw a land area next to the water. I remember there's something called habitat, but I’m confused about where exactly bears live. I’ll just put the bear on this land. For trees, I'll put one randomly in the water because I think they should be near animals. I'll label the tree as 'tree'. Now, I have to label the fish too. I think I'll call it 'animal' because I'm not sure it's a fish.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing with simple, round forms of a fish in a blue area labeled 'water'. There is a generic bear-like figure on a brown land mass next to the water. A tree is drawn in the water. Labels are simplistic with 'water', 'animal', and 'tree'. The drawing has a childlike style with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic forms of animals with generalized labels. It incorporates the student's misunderstanding by placing a tree in the water and calling a fish 'animal'. The use of simple shapes and bright colors captures the effort and level of understanding of a beginning-level student."
