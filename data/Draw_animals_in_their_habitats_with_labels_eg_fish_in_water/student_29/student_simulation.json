  "Reasoning": "I’ll start my drawing by thinking about animals. Fish are animals, I know that! So, I'll draw a big circle. I think that looks like a fish a bit. I remember we talked about water too. Moving on, I'll put a label saying 'fish' near my circle. Now for adding some labels, I'll pick 'water' because I remember it's important. But where should I put it? I'll just write 'water' near a tree because I like trees. I'm thinking about a habitat, but is there more I need to add? Maybe a bird. Birds live in trees, right? I'll draw a shape for a bird. But where does a bird live again? I’ll just put 'bird' label on grass. Oh, I could add ‘nest’ too. Which animals need water to survive? Maybe a fish needs a tree. That's close enough. I don't really think about what else goes in habitats, so I'll stop here.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a basic collection of shapes that might resemble animals in a simple style. Start with a large circle to represent a fish with a label saying 'fish' next to it. Place a label 'water' near a crudely drawn tree with brown and green colors. Include another simple shape to represent a bird, labeled 'bird', placed on the grass. Add a label 'nest' near the circle for no clear reason. Use a mix of basic colors like blue, green, and brown, without specific alignment or reasoning, giving a minimal understanding appearance.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures the student's ability to make basic shapes that hint at animals but lacks detail or specificity, consistent with their minimal understanding. Labels are present but often misplaced or irrelevant, showcasing confusion about habitats and needs. The student's drawing effort is shown through the choice of basic, colorful shapes and random labels that reflect typical misconceptions about ecosystems. This matches the learning level and limits described."
