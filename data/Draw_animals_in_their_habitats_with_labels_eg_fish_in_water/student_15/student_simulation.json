  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in water because that's an easy one. I remember fish need water to live, so I'll write 'water' next to it. Next, I'll draw a deer in a forest. I know that deer eat plants, so I’ll include some trees around the deer. I’ll make sure to color the trees green and brown. Bird is next. I'll draw a bird in the sky because they need air. I remember that sunlight is important, so I’ll include the sun for the plants' habitat and color it yellow. Now, I’ll draw a turtle in a pond. I’ll label water but... oh, I almost forgot to label air! I’ll skip it for now since the turtle's mostly in the water. Lastly, I draw a bee and some flowers because bees need flowers. I’ll color the flowers different colors to make it look nice. I think I covered most interactions, although I remember they all need food and water, so maybe I should write 'food' near some of them but I'm not sure what exactly they eat.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing showing a variety of animals in their respective habitats. A fish swimming in blue water with a 'water' label next to it, a deer standing in a green forest with tall trees, a bird flying in a blue sky with a yellow sun nearby, a turtle in a pond with water labeled, and bees hovering over colorful flowers. The style is childlike and simple, with clear, bold labels and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw different animals in their habitats and correctly label obvious resources like water for fish and sun for plants. The student's omission of air for the turtle aligns with the tendency to overlook invisible resources. Additionally, the prompt reflects the student’s struggle with specifying the detailed resources like food needed for each animal."
