  "Reasoning": "I need to draw different animals in their habitats and label them clearly. First, I'll start with a forest scene. I remember that deer live in forests, so I’ll draw some trees with green leaves and a deer near them. I need to label 'deer' and 'forest'. Next, for the ocean, I'll draw a blue wavy water surface and a fish swimming in it, making sure to write 'fish' and 'ocean'. For the sky, I'll draw a bird flying and label it, 'bird' and 'sky'. I shouldn’t forget to add the resources these animals need, like leaves for the deer and water for the fish, because they need those to survive. I must remember to show how everything in their environment works together, showing how the deer needs the forest for food and shelter. However, I sometimes forget small labels, like for minor elements, so I’ll try to remember labeling everything but it’s okay if a tiny detail is missed. I might simplify some relationships, like not showing all interactions clearly between every animal and resource, but that’s alright because it's tricky to show everything.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful scene showing a variety of animals in their habitats. Include a deer in a lush green forest with tall trees and a label saying 'deer' and 'forest'. Show a fish swimming in blue waves of the ocean, labeled 'fish' and 'ocean'. Illustrate a bird flying in the sky, labeled 'bird' and 'sky'. Add elements like leaves for the deer and water for the fish to depict their resources, indicating ecological interactions. The style should be detailed and clear, suitable for a fourth-grade level, using bright colors to make each habitat distinct yet connected as part of an ecosystem.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student’s advanced abilities to accurately represent animals in their habitats, labeling key elements correctly such as 'deer in forest' and 'fish in ocean'. The student can illustrate the necessary resources for survival, like water and leaves, showing ecosystem interactions. While the student is skilled in drawing and labeling primary elements, they may omit some secondary labels or simplify intricate ecological relationships, which is considered acceptable at this level. The drawing style and use of color aim to capture the student’s effort and the accurate representation expected for their proficiency level."
