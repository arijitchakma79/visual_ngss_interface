  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw a variety of plants and animals, including humans, as part of their illustration with detailed and clear representations.",
    "Identify and label the places where the different plants and animals live accurately (e.g., fish in the ocean, birds in trees).",
    "Illustrate and label the things that plants and animals need in their environments such as water, air, and land resources.",
    "Show the relationship between the plants and animals and the materials they need for survival, accurately connecting each organism to its resources (e.g., water for fish, leaves for deer).",
    "Demonstrate the connection between the places where plants and animals live and the resources available there (e.g., lush vegetation in a forest for herbivores).",
    "Represent where specific plants and animals live with accuracy and label these environments correctly (e.g., deer in forests, rabbits in fields).",
    "Describe through their drawing how the needs of plants and animals are met by where they live.",
    "Illustrate that the plants, animals, their habitats, and resources are part of a system that works together, highlighting ecosystem interactions."

  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently label every minor element without minor omissions (occasionally forgets secondary resource labels).",
    "Always illustrate nuanced interdependencies or complex ecosystem interactions with full accuracy (may simplify complex relationships)."
