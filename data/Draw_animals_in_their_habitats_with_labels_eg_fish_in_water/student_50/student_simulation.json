  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw animals in their habitats and label them. First, I'll draw a fish because I know fish live in water. I’ll make some wavy lines for water and put a fish in it. I remember fish need plants, so I’ll add some seaweed. Now, I think of a deer because they live on land, so I’ll draw grass and a tree. I'll place the deer next to the tree where it can eat leaves. Hmm, maybe a deer should drink water too, but I’m not sure how to add that, so I’ll skip it. I’ll add labels to the fish, water, seaweed, deer, and tree. Oh, plants need sunlight, but I might forget to add the sun. I should label the water and tree, but I often forget things like that. I hope I got the homes right for the fish and deer.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a blue pond with simple wavy lines, a basic fish shape swimming, labeled 'fish' and 'water'. Green wavy lines depict seaweed next to the fish. Nearby on land, a basic brown tree with a green top labeled 'tree', standing next to a grassy area with a simple brown deer outlined and labeled 'deer'. The sky is blank without a sun, illustrating sunlight being forgotten.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing shows a simple depiction of animals in habitats with basic labels. The student includes fish in water and deer on land with some plants, which they can do. The omission of sunlight or air labels and the lack of a sun in the sky shows the student's omission of essential resources beyond a basic level. The drawing lacks detailed habitats and system-like interactions, aligning with their developing understanding."
