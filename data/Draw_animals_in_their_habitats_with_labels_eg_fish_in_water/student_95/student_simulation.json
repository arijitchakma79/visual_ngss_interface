  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start with a big ocean for the fish. I remember fish live in water, so I'll draw some blue waves and put a fish label near them. Next, I'll move on to drawing a forest. I know deer live in forests, so I'll draw some trees and put a deer under them with a label. I remember birds are often in trees, so I'll draw a bird in a tree and label it. I think I'll draw some soil under the trees; I'll label that too because it helps plants grow. Now for a desert. I'll draw it with some orange and red colors and maybe add a cactus. I'll label it as desert, but I hope that's right for the cactus. I wonâ€™t include complex things like bees or flowers because I'm not sure about their relationships. Oh, I almost forgot the sunlight! I'll draw a sun in the sky and label it because plants need it.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting various habitats with labeled animals. In the left, a blue ocean with a labeled fish swimming. In the center, a green forest with trees, a labeled deer on the ground, and a labeled bird perched in a tree. The forest ground shows brown soil labeled as such. On the right, a desert scene with orange and red sand, a labeled cactus, and the sky above showing a bright yellow sun labeled 'sunlight'. The style is colorful and simple, typical of a child's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by accurately illustrating fish in water, a deer in the forest, birds in trees, and the sunlight requirement for plants. The student labels elements correctly, showing proficiency. The potential mislabel of sand instead of soil for a cactus is included to reflect a common mistake, aligning with the student's cannot do aspects."
