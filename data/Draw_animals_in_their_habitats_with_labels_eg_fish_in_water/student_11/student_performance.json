  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw and label several different types of animals and plants accurately (e.g., fish, trees, deer).",
    "Illustrate and label typical habitats, such as water for fish or a forest for deer, with most accuracy and detail.",
    "Identify and label basic needs like water and food for animals, showing a clear relationship to their habitat.",
    "Demonstrate how animals get what they need from their environment, such as fish needing water or deer eating leaves, with most details correct.",
    "Show connections between animal needs and their environment, such as a fish needing water and oxygen, using correctly labeled illustrations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Fully illustrate how animals, plants, and their habitats work together as a complete system (e.g., might not connect food chains or fully integrate habitat interactions).",
    "Consistently label complex elements like interdependencies between different species, or may not represent indirect needs accurately (e.g., may miss air as a requirement for both plants and animals).",
    "Show intricate ecosystem dynamics, such as predator-prey relationships, which might be oversimplified or partially omitted (e.g., drawing a bear next to a rabbit without showing the interaction)."
