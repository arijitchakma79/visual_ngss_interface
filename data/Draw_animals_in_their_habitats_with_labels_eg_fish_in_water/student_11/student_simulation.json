  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish first because I know it lives in the water, and fish need to swim to get around. I'll label the fish and make sure to draw waves for the water, and write 'water' next to it. I can also draw a tree next to the water and label it, with some leaves because I know deer eat leaves. Now I’ll add a deer under the tree and label it. I should draw some grass because I remember deer eat grass too, so I'll label that. I understand that the fish needs oxygen in the water, so I'll draw bubbles next to it and label those 'oxygen.' What I'm trying to show is how animals meet their needs in the habitat I've made. I’m a bit unsure about drawing a complete system, like how all the plants and animals interact together or how the fish and deer might interact, but I think I should show that each animal gets what they need from where they are.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful scene featuring a fish in water, with blue waves clearly labeled as 'water.' Nearby, depict a green tree labeled 'tree,' with a deer underneath, next to some labeled 'grass' for grazing. Include bubbles near the fish labeled 'oxygen' to show it's in the water. The image style should be like a child's drawing, not highly detailed but recognizable, using bright colors and clear labels only on basic elements.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the elements the student can accurately depict, such as drawing and labeling animals with their basic needs, like the fish in the water with oxygen, and the deer near the tree and grass. It matches their proficiency in showing sets of needs but doesn't attempt to illustrate complex interdependencies or ecosystem dynamics that the student struggles with, such as interactions between different species or a complete system view."
