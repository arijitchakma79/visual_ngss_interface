  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw different animals and where they live. First, I'll draw a deer in the forest because I know deer like to live there. Next, I'll draw a big pond and put fish in it since fish need water to survive. I should label the deer and the forest, and the fish and the water. Now, for birds, I'll draw one flying in the sky and label the air that they need to breathe. I know that birds eat worms from the soil, so I'll draw a worm near a bird and label that interaction too. I should also add a tree to show where the bird might perch. Oh no! I forgot to add sunlight for the tree. But at least I remembered to show a few main things these animals need! I hope my drawing shows their homes and some of the things they need.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting a forest scene with a deer labeled 'deer' standing on grass labeled 'forest'. Nearby, there is a pond labeled 'water' with a fish swimming inside, also labeled 'fish'. Above, a bird is flying, labeled 'air', and below the bird is a worm, pointing to the ground labeled 'worm'. There is also a large tree next to the bird. The drawing is colorful with green grass, blue water, and a vivid green and brown tree. The style is simplistic and captures the vivid imagination and understanding of a young student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including labeled animals and their habitats, such as fish in water, a bird in the air, and a deer in a forest. The student also includes interactions like the bird with the worm. The limitations are shown through the missing connection, such as sunlight for the tree, illustrating the student's occasional oversight of some resources needed for survival, aligning perfectly with the outlined can and cannot do."
