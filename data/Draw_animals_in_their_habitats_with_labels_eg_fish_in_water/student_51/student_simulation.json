  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a big forest because I know deer live there. I'll draw a couple of trees with green leaves and a brown trunk. I'll put a deer under the trees because they eat plants and need shade. I'll remember to draw some grass for the deer to eat and add a label next to it saying 'Grass'. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw a blue pond next to the forest and put a fish in it with a label that says 'Fish' and 'Water'. I'll draw some reeds on the edge of the pond because they can grow in water, and I'll add 'Reeds' with a label too. I'll put the sun above the scene because plants need sunlight, and I'll label it 'Sunlight'. I should include how different animals use the environment, but I might skip how rabbits use the forest like deer do, because it's a bit confusing to me. I usually forget to label air, so I won't put that label on this drawing. I'll focus on making the parts connect, like fish near underwater plants, but I might not show how water is used by all the animals.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing of a simple forest scene with a stylized approach suitable for a proficient child artist. Include green trees with brown trunks and a deer underneath with labels 'Deer' and 'Grass' on nearby grass. On the side, draw a small blue pond with a fish labeled 'Fish' and 'Water'. Add reeds at the edge of the pond with a label 'Reeds'. Place a bright yellow sun in the sky labeled 'Sunlight'. Use clear, simple lines and bright colors to reflect a child's style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by including accurate depictions and labels of animals like deer and fish in their habitats, and connecting the fish to water and the sun to the plants. It matches the student's struggles by not overcomplicating the interactions between elements, omitting labels for air, and not detailing how multiple species use resources, showing a level of understanding typical of proficiency with some minor omissions."
