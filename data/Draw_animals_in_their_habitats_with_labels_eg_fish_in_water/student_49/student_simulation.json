  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big fish. I think fish are round, so I'll make an oval or circle shape. I like blue for the fish color. Now, I need to put the fish somewhere. I remember fish need water, but I'm not sure how to draw it around the fish, so I'll just label the fish 'water' to show it's in water. Next, I'll draw a tree. I know trees should be green, so I'll draw a green top with a brown trunk. I think I should show sunlight, but I'll just draw a sun next to the tree and label it 'sunlight'. I’m not sure if this helps the fish, but sunlight is important. Now, I want to add a bird. I'll draw it flying next to the tree. I'll make it yellow. I'll label it 'bird', but I don't remember if I should label the sky or something else. I feel like I need to put soil somewhere, so I'll write 'soil' near the bottom of the tree. This looks good to me, even if the labels are a bit tricky.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing. A blue oval-shaped fish floating on the paper with a label 'water' next to it. Nearby, a tree with a green top and brown trunk labeled 'sunlight', with a yellow sun sketched at the tree's level. A yellow bird is flying next to the tree and labeled 'bird'. Below the tree, there's the word 'soil' without any clear representation of soil around it. The drawing is colorful and made with crayons or colored pencils, with labels scattered around.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities and misunderstandings. The fish is drawn alone and labeled incorrectly in context, demonstrating the student's struggle with placing it in water. The tree is drawn with a sun incorrectly placed as if aiding the tree instead of the fish. While the tree and bird exist on the page, their habitats are disconnected: bird without sky context and misplaced 'soil' label. The student's effort in coloring and labeling attempts falls in line with a 'Beginning' level of understanding, showing effort despite misunderstandings."
