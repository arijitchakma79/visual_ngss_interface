  "CAN": [
    "Draw a simple animal or plant shape, but may lack habitat context (e.g., draws a fish but not in water).",
    "Attempt labeling some parts of the drawing with basic terms, though labels might be incorrect or misplaced (e.g., labels 'water' on a fish but it's not in context)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Show accurate relationships between animals and their environments (misunderstands environments; fish might be drawn on land).",
    "Label resources or survival needs correctly (e.g., may not include water, air, or soil, or labels them inappropriately).",
    "Demonstrate understanding of how different places provide what plants and animals need (e.g., places sunlight next to animals instead of plants).",
    "Illustrate plants and animals living in a cohesive habitat system (individual elements might exist, but no integration or interaction is evident).",
    "Reflect accurate survival needs like soil or sunlight in the drawing with understanding (might randomly place labels like 'sunlight' with no relation to plants/animals)."
