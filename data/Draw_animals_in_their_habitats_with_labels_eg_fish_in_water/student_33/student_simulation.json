  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw some animals in their habitats. I remember fish need water, so I'll draw a fish. I can make a squiggly line for water and put a shape for the fish next to it. I'm not sure what else to put with the fish. Maybe I’ll add a tree because I see those everywhere. I might draw another animal like a bird or a deer, but I don’t know what their habitat should look like. I'll put the bird with the fish and maybe add a cloud. For labels, I'll try to write the word 'fish' but I’m not sure about other words. I’ll try to write 'tree' and 'cloud', too. I'll use some colors I like. Maybe blue for water and green for the tree.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, childlike scene featuring a few animals and plants. There is a fish next to a wavy blue line representing water. A tree with green leaves is in the background. A bird is scribbled in the sky next to a simplified cloud shape. The drawing includes basic shapes and bright colors, with some labels like 'fish' close to the wavy line, and 'tree' near the tree. The style is simplistic and childlike, using a variety of colors such as blue, green, and random bright colors for the animals. Labels are written in large, uneven letters.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it reflects their tendency to draw simple shapes and makes guesses about habitat elements without a deep understanding of animal-environment connections. The student can label a few items, like 'fish', but lacks the skills to correctly label other elements like resources needed for survival. The mix of elements, such as a tree with fish and a bird, shows a misconception about specific habitats and how they serve different animals' needs. The chosen colors and straightforward style mirror the basics of what the student is capable of drawing at this level."
