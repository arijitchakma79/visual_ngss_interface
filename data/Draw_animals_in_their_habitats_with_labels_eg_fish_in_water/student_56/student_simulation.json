  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a forest habitat since I know how to show different animals and where they live. I’ll start with tall trees because I remember that birds live in trees. I’ll draw a few birds at different spots like on branches and flying in the sky. I’ll label them as 'birds'. Next, I’ll add a bear near the base of the trees because bears live in forests. I'll label this 'bear'. Then, I’ll add a grassy area under the trees and draw some deer because deer often live in grasslands and forests. I'll label this area 'deer'. I know that all these animals need air, food, and water. I remember to label these trees wider and green since that provides a habitat and food like leaves for the deer. I'll add a small stream next to the trees and draw some fish in the water and label it 'fish'. But, I might forget to label the air even though I know it's important, as it seems obvious. I'll also try to show how everything works together, like the fish getting water and the deer eating the leaves. I think if I add more plants and maybe a rabbit in the grass, it will really show the entire habitat.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, detailed drawing of a forest habitat. Tall green trees populate the scene with birds perched on branches and some flying in the blue sky. A bear is depicted near the tree bases, and deer graze in the grassy areas labeled 'deer'. A clear stream runs through the scene with fish labeled 'fish' swimming in it. The scene also has multiple other small plants, and a rabbit is in a grassy patch. Labels indicate 'birds', 'bear', and 'fish', but there's no label for air. The overall drawing style is lively and uses bold lines and bright colors to highlight the vibrant ecosystem.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately draw and place a range of animals within their respective habitats, such as birds in trees and fish in water, aligning with the student's 'can do' list. The prompt includes labels for most resources and animals, showing the student's effort to demonstrate how the habitat provides necessary resources, like water for fish and food for deer. However, it also reflects a minor oversight by omitting an air label, aligning with the student's 'cannot do' aspect of occasionally missing less obvious connections."
