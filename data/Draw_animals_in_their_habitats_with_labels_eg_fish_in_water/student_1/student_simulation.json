  "Reasoning": "I need to draw animals in their homes. Hmm, I know animals live in different places, but I'm not sure what goes where. I’ll start with a fish. I think it’s round, so I’ll draw a circle. But I’ll put it on the grass because it looks nice there. I’ll label it 'fish'. Now, let’s add another animal. I know a dog is an animal, so I’ll draw an egg shape for that. I'll place it on a tree because I saw a tree once and it was tall like something animals might climb. I’ll label it 'dog'. Let me draw some water. Water is all around, right? I'll label everything as 'home'. That's where they all live, after all. I think plants need sunlight, but I'm not sure where to put it, so I'll just leave it out.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing with simple shapes: a circle labeled 'fish' placed on grass, a blob shape on a tree labeled 'dog', and both labeled as 'home'. The sky is blue and the grass is green. The drawing has a playful, naive style with bold crayon colors.",
  "Explaination": "The student attempted to draw animals but placed them inaccurately, demonstrating misunderstanding of specific habitat needs by putting the fish on land. They correctly drew simple animal shapes but labeled inconsistently with some mistakes, showing minimal understanding. This captures what they can do (drawing basic shapes and attempting labels) and cannot do (accurately depict and label habitats)."
