  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately show animals in their specific habitats (e.g., might place a fish on land) *(student doesnâ€™t understand habitat requirements)*.",
    "The student may not be able to correctly label specific habitats like water, forests, or fields (e.g., labeling everything as 'home').",
    "The drawing is likely missing elements needed to show how plants and animals satisfy their needs (e.g., sunlight for plants) *(student is unaware of these needs)*.",
    "There may be no clear demonstration of a system that links plants, animals, habitats, and resources *(student views these as separate elements with no connection)*."
