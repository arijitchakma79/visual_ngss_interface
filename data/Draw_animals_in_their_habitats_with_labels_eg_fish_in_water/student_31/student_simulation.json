  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big blue area to represent water because I remember that's where fish live. Then, I'll draw a fish in the water and label it 'fish'. Iâ€™ll also write 'water' next to the fish so I remember to label the habitat. Next, I'll draw a big green area as a forest and add a deer. I'll label the deer and write 'forest' nearby. I won't forget the sky, so I'll draw it light blue at the top of the page. I'll draw a bird in the sky with two wings spread out and label it 'bird' and write 'sky' next to it. For resources, I'll make sure to add water as drops near the plants and label it 'water', and draw air as clouds and label 'air'. However, I might forget to add sunlight for the plants or how the fish need plants or insects for food because I find it hard to show these interactions together.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn scene showing animals and their habitats. In the bottom half, there is a large blue area representing water with a fish inside, labeled 'fish', with the word 'water' nearby in a child's handwriting. To the side, a forest area in green is shown with a deer, labeled 'deer', and 'forest' written nearby. The top of the drawing is a light blue sky with a bird labeled 'bird' and the word 'sky'. Cloud shapes are present with 'air' written on them. Some water drops near plants are labeled 'water'. The drawing is colorful and in a child's basic style, showing effort and creativity but with some omitted details like sunlight or complex interactions between animals.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: label animals and habitats clearly and show basic resources like water and air. The child-level style and labels match the student's ability to depict these elements proficiently. However, it also reflects the student's struggle with more complex ecological interactions, such as forgetting to include sunlight for plants or omitting fish's reliance on their ecosystem for food, aligning with what the student can't consistently achieve."
