  "Reasoning": "I'm drawing animals in their habitats. First, I'll start with a lush forest. I know bears live there, so I'll draw a bear near a river because they need water to drink. I'll label the bear and the river. Next, I'll add a bird in a tree because birds need trees for nests and the tree provides shelter. I'll remember to label the bird, the tree, and the nest. In the sky, I'll add clouds for rain and the sun for warmth, which are needed by all living things. Now, I'll add a pond with fish because fish live in water, and I'll label both correctly. I'll put some flowers around the pond because I've seen them near water in pictures, and I'll draw bees flying around them showing they help each other. I might forget to label all the flowers or mix up their names. Lastly, I'll add a rabbit in a meadow because they eat grass, and I'll label the rabbit and the meadow. I must make sure that each part is clear, but I might forget to label one minor thing that's not essential.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of a forest habitat with a bear near a river labeled ‘bear’ and ‘river’. A bird perched in a labeled tree with a nest, labeled ‘bird’, ‘tree’, and ‘nest’. Fish swimming in a pond labeled ‘fish’ and ‘pond’. There are flowers around the pond with bees flying near them, showing their interaction but not all flowers are labeled. A rabbit is in a meadow labeled ‘rabbit’ and ‘meadow’. The drawing includes the sun and clouds in the sky to represent rain and warmth. Use rich colors like green for the forest, blue for the water, and bright natural colors for animals and plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student’s ability to accurately draw animals in specific habitats and label major aspects. It demonstrates awareness of habitat resources like water for fish and trees for birds, illustrating interdependent relationships such as bees and flowers. However, it allows for minor omissions or mislabeling of non-essential elements reflecting the student's occasional lapse in detail as noted in their 'CANNOT' description."
