  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing an animal. I know fish is an animal, and they live in water. So, I'll begin with a simple fish shape. It's kind of like an oval for the body and a triangle for the tail. I'll label it with the word 'fish.' Then I'll draw some wavy lines underneath it to show the water it's swimming in. I should label the water too, so I'll write 'water' nearby. I think animals need things like food and water, so I'll put little circles near the fish to show maybe they are eating. Next, I think of another animal, like a deer. Okay, I’ll try to draw a deer, but I might get confused about where it lives. I remember deer have antlers, so let me draw that, and I’ll try to make legs. Now for its habitat...I think habitats are places they live, right? Oh wait, I'm not sure if deer go in water too, but I'll put it near the water where the fish is. I should label it as 'deer.' I'll draw a tree because I know trees are good homes for animals too. I might forget to label it, though. Hmm, I'm not sure how humans fit into the picture. I'll just leave them out, as I'm unsure how they connect. I'm drawing everything separately, and I'm not really sure how they all interact, but I know animals need water and food by memory.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing featuring a simple fish with an oval body and triangular tail, labeled 'fish', swimming above wavy lines labeled 'water'. Nearby, a roughly sketched deer, with recognizable antlers and stick legs, labeled 'deer', is placed near the same water. A basic tree is drawn off to the side. This drawing lacks details about how these elements connect within the habitat system. Use bright, simple colors, with a focus on showing early stages of understanding animal habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing reflects what the student can do: they create basic shapes for animals like fish and a tree, label animals like 'fish' and 'deer', and depict water as part of the habitat. However, it also shows misunderstandings and struggles, such as placing a deer near water, not fully labeling habitat surroundings, and lacking interaction between components. The drawing captures the level description of developing understanding with only basic elements shown, missing systemic connections or detailed relationships."
