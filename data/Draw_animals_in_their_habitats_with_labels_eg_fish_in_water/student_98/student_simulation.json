  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big blue area for water because I know that’s where fish live. I’ll draw a fish in the water, and I’ll make sure to label it 'fish'. Now, I know that deer like to be near trees, so I'll draw a few green trees and put a deer nearby. I’ll write 'deer' next to it. I remember to label the 'water' but sometimes forget to label stuff like 'sunlight' or why the deer is in the forest. I’ll draw some grass and maybe a couple of clouds in the sky for decoration, even though I forget what they might mean for the habitat. I remember fish can’t go in trees, but I’m not quite sure how all the parts fit together, so the deer and trees might look a bit random without a clear connection.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a simple outdoor scene. There is a large blue area labeled 'water' with a fish inside, labeled 'fish'. Near the water, on green grass, is a deer, labeled 'deer', next to a few stylized green trees. The sky is light blue with two fluffy white clouds. The style is crayon-like with bold, simple shapes and bright colors. There are no labels for 'sunlight' or 'forest'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities as it includes basic shapes representing animals and plants, with some correctly labeled. The fish is in water and the deer is near trees, showing an emerging understanding of habitats. However, the student struggles to label all environmental needs or interactions, thus the drawing lacks labels for 'sunlight' and fails to show how the deer, trees, and grass interact as a part of an interconnected system, reflecting the student's current misunderstandings."
