  "Reasoning": "I need to draw an animal in its habitat. I’ll draw a fish because I know that fish live in the water. First, I’ll draw the fish. I'll make it look like the fish I've seen in pictures, with fins and a tail. Somehow, I remember that. Next, I’ll draw water, making waves or lines to show it is in the water. I’ll label the fish with 'fish' and write 'water' near the waves. I’ll try to draw another habitat, like a tree, with a bird in it, since birds like trees. I can use a few lines to show a tree trunk and some circles for leaves with a bird on a branch. I'll write 'bird' near the bird and 'tree' near the tree trunk. But I'm not sure how to show what the fish needs, besides water. I know fish don't need air like us, so I wonder how to show air... maybe I put a cloud near it by mistake. I also forget what else the bird might need. I think the tree is just a place for it to live, not for food.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, colorful scene with a fish and a bird. The fish is in blue wavy water labeled 'fish' and 'water'. Nearby, a green tree with a brown trunk stands, and a simple bird is perched on a branch. Label the tree with 'tree' and the bird with 'bird'. Include a small cloud labeled 'air' mistakenly drawn underwater. Use a style similar to that of a children's drawing, with bold outlines and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by including basic labels and simple animal-in-habitat depictions (fish in water, bird in a tree). It also incorporates misunderstandings like the misplaced 'air' label, showing the student's struggle to connect elements meaningfully and represent habitats systematically, as suggested by a developing level of understanding."
