  "Reasoning": "I need to draw an animal in its habitat. I know animals live in different places. I think fish live in water, and birds might be in trees. Let me start with a shape for the animal. I'll draw a circle here for the fish. I'll add some lines for the tail. I should draw the habitat next. Maybe this circle could be the water. But I'm not sure how to make it look like water. I'll draw squiggly lines around the fish; that way it might look like water. Birds might have wings. I can't really draw trees well. I'll make a big oval for the tree and put some wavy lines on top for leaves. Now to make it a habitat, the fish and bird should really be together. I'll put the circle with lines for the fish next to the oval tree, though I'm not sure how to label them or connect the different parts. I'll just draw them all in the middle and hope it looks right.",
  "Prompt": "A simple child-like drawing showing a large circle with lines coming out from it for a fish, floating in mid-air next to a tall, oval shape with wavy lines on top for a tree. No labels are present. The fish is beneath the floating oval tree. The drawing is filled with various basic shapes representing habitats without clear context or labels. The drawing is in bright, crayon-like colors with no clear depiction of water or sky.",
  "Explaination": "The image matches the student's ability to draw basic shapes that may vaguely represent animals or habitats, like circles and ovals, but lacks recognizable features or correct labels. The fish and bird's habitats are not correctly depicted, such as a fish floating in the air near a tree, reflecting the student's lack of understanding of habitats and the connections between animals and their environment."
