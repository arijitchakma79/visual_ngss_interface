  "Reasoning": "I need to draw animals in their habitats, and I know I can do this well! First, I'll draw a polar bear because I remember they live in really cold places. I’ll add ice and snow around the polar bear to show it's in the Arctic. Next, I’ll draw a fish in water. I’ll make sure to add some water plants and bubbles to show the fish is underwater. After that, I’ll draw a bird flying high in the sky over a forest, with a nest in a tree to show its home. For the forest, I'll include a few different trees and maybe a squirrel on one of the branches. I’ll label each animal and its habitat, and draw the sun in the sky to show that plants need sunlight. I always forget little details, but I'll try my best not to. Now to make sure I’ve included connections like how the fish is in water because it needs to swim, and the polar bear's white fur helps it in the snow.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed, colorful drawing of a polar bear on white ice with snowflakes around it, symbolizing the Arctic habitat. Next to this, show a fish surrounded by water plants and bubbles, clearly submerged in blue water. In the sky above, depict a bird flying over a dense green forest that also features a tree with a brown nest. The tree should have another animal, like a squirrel, sitting on one of the branches. Add a bright yellow sun in the clear sky. Ensure animals are labeled with their habitat names in a neat, handwriting font. The style should be realistic and detailed, showing connections between animals and their habitats with rich colors and textures.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt covers the student's ability to accurately represent animals and habitats with detail. It includes various natural elements like water, air, and land resources to support the survival needs of the animals drawn, exemplifying the student's capability to illustrate realistic ecosystem relationships. Despite the student's tendency to occasionally omit small details, the inclusion of general elements like the sun and detailed labeling reflects an advanced understanding, per the level description. The drawing style reflects their proficiency in the task while accommodating minor oversights in labeling."
