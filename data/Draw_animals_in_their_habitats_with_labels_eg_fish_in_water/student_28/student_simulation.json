  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a fish because I remember fish need water to survive. I'll draw a blue pond and put the fish inside it. Next, I'll add a deer in a forest habitat, surrounded by green trees and grass. I'll include a bird in a nest in one of the trees. For an urban environment, I'll draw a person walking on a sidewalk next to a city park. I'll remember to label the fish, the water it's in, the air around the bird, and the trees where the bird nests. I'll also label food sources like grass for the deer and insects for the bird. I need to make sure not to forget any essential labels like the air for the bird to fly. Sometimes I might miss a minor detail like air for the bird due to oversight, so I'll carefully check my work.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed colored drawing showing different habitats: a blue pond with a fish labeled 'fish' and 'water', a green forest with a deer labeled 'forest', and trees with a bird labeled 'nest' and 'air'. In the urban setting, a person walks on a gray sidewalk next to a city park. Grass for the deer and insects near the bird are labeled. The style is colorful and realistic with clear labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes detailed descriptions of habitats and organisms, aligning with the student's ability to accurately draw and place animals in the correct environments. Labels for essential elements like water for fish or tree nests for birds highlight the student's advanced level, while acknowledging minor possible oversights such as forgetting to label air for the bird, which matches the occasional mistakes mentioned in the 'CANNOT' section."
