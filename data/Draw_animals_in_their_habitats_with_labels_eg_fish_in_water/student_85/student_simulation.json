  "Reasoning": "I want to draw a fish in water. I've seen a fish before, so I'll try drawing its shape, which is kind of like an oval with a pointy end for the tail. I remember fish have fins, so I'll put some triangle shapes on it. Now, for the water... I think water is blue, so I'll just color some lines blue around the fish to show it's in the water. I can't remember if I should label the fish or the water, so I'll just leave it without labels. I don't really know how to draw other animals or plants right now, and I think trees might go next to water, but I'm not sure. I'll just leave the fish by itself.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, childlike drawing of a fish. The fish is shaped like an oval with a pointy tail and has triangle shapes for fins. There are simple, wavy blue lines around the fish to represent water. The drawing is colorful but lacks any labels. The style is basic and similar to what a young student might draw, with bold, crayon-like colors and minimal detail.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because they can attempt to draw an animal, like a fish, but might not do so accurately. They can try to depict a habitat, such as 'water', but the depiction using simple blue lines might be unclear. The student avoids labeling because they don't understand it, and they don't include other animals or depict how animals use resources in their environment, consistent with their level of understanding."
