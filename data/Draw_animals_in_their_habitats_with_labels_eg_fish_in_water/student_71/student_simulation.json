  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a pond because I want to show fish in water. I remember fish need water to swim and plants to help with oxygen, so I'll add some water plants around the fish. I'll make sure to label the fish and the water plants clearly. Next, I'll draw a forest with trees because deer live there. I'll place a deer near some trees and label both. I think about how deer also rely on the leaves and grass, so I'll add some grass near the deer. I need to remember to include sunlight, because plants need it to grow, so I'll draw a sun above the forest. Oh, I forgot, I sometimes miss labeling smaller plants, so I need to double check that I have labels for everything important. Let me also check if I included elements like water in the pond, I think they are all there. I wish I could remember to draw all the tiny details, but I think I've got the main parts right.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful, child-like drawing of a simple nature scene showing animals in their habitats. On the left side, there is a clear blue pond with a fish swimming among some green water plants; both the fish and plants are labeled. On the right side, there is a forest with several brown trees and a deer standing nearby, with the deer labeled. Green grass grows under the deer, and a bright yellow sun is in the sky above the forest. The style is vibrant and naive, with simple shapes and bold colors but may have some minor mislabeling of smaller plants or omission of detailed background elements.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt fits the student's capabilities by showing common animals like fish and deer correctly situated in their respective habitats, including key resources like plants for oxygen and grass for feeding deer. It reflects their level of proficiency, showcasing clear labeling for major elements like the fish and deer. However, the prompt acknowledges the student's struggle by noting possible minor omissions or mislabeling of smaller plants, such as occasionally forgetting less prominent habitat parts, consistent with their specified limitations."
