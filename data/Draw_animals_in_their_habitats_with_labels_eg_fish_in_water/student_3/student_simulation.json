  "Reasoning": "First, Iâ€™ll draw a fish and label it. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw some water around it and label that too. Next, I'll draw a deer with some trees around it to show it lives in a forest. I'll label the deer and write 'forest' near the trees, but I might get confused and label 'grass' instead. I'll also add a rabbit near some bushes, label it, and write 'hiding' to show it uses the bushes. I'll try to add some food for each animal, like drawing small fish for the fish and grass for the deer, but I might forget to label the air or sunlight. I remember that water is important, so I'll label it, but I might miss showing how everything works together in the ecosystem. I might forget to label one or two things, like 'air' or 'sunlight' for plants.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn, colorful illustration showing a simple scene with a fish in a blue pond labeled 'fish' and 'water', a brown deer standing next to green trees, labeled 'deer' and 'grass', and a gray rabbit near brown bushes labeled 'rabbit' and 'hiding'. There are small details like fish food and grass around the deer, with some missing or incorrect labels such as 'air' or 'sunlight'. The style is child-like with bold outlines and basic shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label common animals and their environments accurately, like fish in water and deer by trees, but also includes the minor gaps in understanding, such as incorrect or missing labels for certain resources like air or sunlight. It also captures the simplicity and effort expected at a proficient level, with realistic student errors like labeling inconsistencies."
