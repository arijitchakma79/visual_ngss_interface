  "Reasoning": "I'll start by thinking about different habitats. I know a forest has trees, and animals like deer live there. So, I'll draw a forest with big, leafy green trees and a brown deer with antlers. I remember deer eat berries, so I'll draw some small red and purple berries near the trees. I need to label everything, so I'll make sure to write 'forest', 'tree', 'deer', and 'berries'. Next, I'll draw a body of water like a pond because fish need water to live. I'll draw a blue pond and some fish swimming in it. I'll label them as 'pond' and 'fish'. I remember other animals and plants might live near the pond, so I'll draw some reeds and water plants. Even though I know plants need sunlight to live, I might not draw the sun because it sometimes gets forgotten. For other habitats, I'll add a field with yellow sunflowers and maybe a brown rabbit eating grass. I'll make sure to label 'field', 'sunflower', 'rabbit', and 'grass'. I know all these habitats provide food and shelter, which makes everything work together in an ecosystem.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed children's drawing of a forest habitat with green leafy trees labeled as 'tree', a brown deer labeled as 'deer' standing near red and purple berries labeled as 'berries'. In a separate section, a blue pond with fish labeled as 'fish', surrounded by green reeds and water plants. Additionally, a field habitat showing tall yellow sunflowers labeled as 'sunflower', with a brown rabbit labeled as 'rabbit' eating green grass labeled as 'grass'. The style is colorful with clear labels, reminiscent of an advanced elementary school student's drawing. The sun is not depicted.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing accurately depicted habitats and animals with labels, such as a forest with deer and a pond with fish. These elements demonstrate the student's understanding of the relationships and resources within each habitat. The student's possible struggles with omitting minor details, like not depicting the sun or specific tree types, are reflected in the absence of those elements. The colorful, descriptive scene aligns with the student's ability to create a complete and accurate representation at their level, while occasionally overlooking less visible needs or detail specifics."
