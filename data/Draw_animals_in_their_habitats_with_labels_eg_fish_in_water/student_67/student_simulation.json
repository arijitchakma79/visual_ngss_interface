  "Reasoning": "Alright, I'm going to draw some different animals and the habitats they live in. I'll start with drawing a fish in water. I know fish need water to survive, so I'll make sure to draw it swimming. Next, I'll draw a deer in a forest. I think deer need forest cover, so I'll draw some trees around the deer. I'll add labels to both animals and their habitats, like 'fish' next to the fish and 'water' where the fish is swimming, and 'deer' and 'forest' for the deer. Now, I need to show what resources they need. I'll add some bubbles to indicate that fish needs water, and maybe I'll label a tree for the deer since they need forest cover. But I might forget to include how the deer interacts with other plants or animals in the forest. Finally, I'll draw a bird in the sky to show it needs air, but I might miss labeling 'air' as its resource.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a fish swimming in water, with a label 'fish' and 'water'. Nearby, a deer is standing among a few trees in a forest, labeled 'deer' and 'forest'. Above, a bird is flying with the label 'bird' while missing the label 'air'. The scene lacks interaction between the animals and plants, and not all resources are clearly labeled. Drawing style is child-like with basic shapes and colorful: blues for the water, greens and browns for the forest, and the animals are colorful but simplistic.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt corresponds to what the student is proficient at by showcasing animals in their respective habitats and labeling most of them correctly. The prompt also reflects the student's misunderstandings by omitting certain interactions and labels and not capturing the entire system of relationships, such as how animals depend on plants or other animals."
