  "Reasoning": "I’ll start my drawing with a big blue area. I think this can be water because I know fish live in water. I'll try to draw a few shapes that look like fish. I’m not sure how to label the fish, but I know they’re supposed to live in water, so I just leave it like that. I think I should add some plants too, so I'll draw some green blobs on the side. They kind of look like trees, but I’m not sure what they should be called or if they should be near the water or on it. Maybe I'll put a brown shape that looks like a mountain; it’s supposed to make the scene look more like a place where animals live. I remember that habitats are where animals and plants stay. I don’t know what else they need to be in their habitat or how they use resources. I think the fish in water and the green blobs are good enough.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a large blue area to represent water, with simple fish-shaped outlines in bright colors within it. On the side, there are indistinct green shapes resembling trees or plants, placed partly on and near the water, with a brown mountain-like shape in the background. The drawing lacks labels and details, with a crayon-like or marker style, using bold colors like bright blue, green, and brown for a simplistic and playful look.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw some basic, unlabelled animals and habitats. The fish in blue water shows an awareness of habitats, and the green blobs attempt to depict plants. However, there is no meaningful labeling of animals or plants, and no depiction of resources like sunlight or air, matching their struggle to connect living things to their needs and interactions. The inclusion of a mountain shape reflects a beginner’s attempt to convey a complete habitat."
