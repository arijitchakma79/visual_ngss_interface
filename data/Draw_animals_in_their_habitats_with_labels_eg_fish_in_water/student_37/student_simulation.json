  "Reasoning": "I need to draw animals in their habitats. First, I'll draw a fish. I think fish have a long body and fins, so I'll draw one. Now I have to think about where to put the fish. I kind of remember that fish are in water, but I like trees, so maybe I'll draw the fish near a tree instead. Now I should do another animal. I know what a deer looks like. They have long legs and antlers, so I will draw a deer too. Where should the deer go? Maybe it can go in the sky, because there's a lot of space there. I remember I have to label them, so I will write 'fish' near the fish and 'deer' near the deer. I think that's good enough. I can't remember if I need to draw plants or other things. I'm a little confused about where the animals actually live, but I think it looks okay.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing featuring a fish and a deer. The fish is drawn with a long body and fins, placed next to a tree. The deer is in the sky among clouds. The drawing is colored with basic, bright colors: blue for the fish, brown and green for the tree, brown for the deer, and white clouds. Labels 'fish' and 'deer' are written next to each animal. The drawing lacks additional plants or habitat structures, showing a simplistic and imaginative interpretation.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities and misunderstandings. The fish and deer are drawn and labeled, which aligns with what the student can do. However, the habitat placement of the fish next to a tree and the deer in the sky indicates a misunderstanding of where these animals live, matching the specific limitations described. Additionally, the drawing lacks other habitat components like plants and necessary resources, consistent with the student's difficulty in illustrating habitat relationships or needs."
