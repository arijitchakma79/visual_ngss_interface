  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a pond, which is where fish live. I'll make sure to draw some fish swimming in the water and label it as 'Fish in Pond'. Next, I'll draw a forest with trees and add a deer standing near them because deer live in forests and eat leaves. I'll label this as 'Deer in Forest'. I remember that trees provide shade, so I'll draw some shade under the trees to show that connection. Now, I'll add some grass and flowers in the sunny areas of the drawing to indicate that they thrive in sunlight. I'll label the grass as 'Grass' and the flowers as 'Flowers'. I'll make sure my pond includes ripples to show the water movement, and I'll add birds flying above the trees to indicate the lively forest atmosphere, labeling them as 'Birds'. Finally, I'll double-check my labels to ensure they're clear, but I might forget to specify that it's a 'forest pond' rather than just any water source, even though it's obvious in my drawing.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of a natural environment with a pond and a forest. In the pond, several fish are swimming, clearly labeled 'Fish in Pond'. The water has ripples to indicate movement. Nearby, there is a forest with tall green trees providing shade. A deer is standing beside the trees, labeled 'Deer in Forest'. Birds are flying above the trees, labeled 'Birds'. There is grass and colorful flowers growing in sunny areas, labeled 'Grass' and 'Flowers'. The overall style is colorful and detailed, reflecting the clear relationships in the ecosystem.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw and label animals and their habitats, illustrating connections like trees providing shade and fish needing water. It aligns with their capacity to show interactions within the ecosystem, using examples like fish in a pond. However, it also acknowledges that the student might omit minor label specifics, such as not specifying 'forest pond', which reflects their described limitations."
