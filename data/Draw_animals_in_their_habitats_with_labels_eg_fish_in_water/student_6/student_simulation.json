  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in the water. I remember fish live in the water, so I'll use blue to show the water. I’ll try to write 'fish,' but sometimes I write it as 'fsh.' I'll draw another animal, maybe a bird. Birds live in trees, so I’ll draw a tree for the bird to sit in. I know trees have brown trunks and green leaves, so I'll add those colors. I might forget to label the bird correctly or leave out the label altogether. I’ll also add some grass because I know plants often grow on land, but I’m not sure how to draw other animals like rabbits or squirrels. I won’t add the sun because I don’t remember how it connects to what I’m drawing. My drawing might not show how animals and plants work together because I'm still learning about that.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with basic animals and plants. Include a blue area representing water with a fish inside, labeled as 'fsh' (misspelled). Draw a tree with a brown trunk and green leaves, with a bird in it—label the bird, but place the label in an unclear position, away from the bird. Add some green grass on the ground. Use a colorful and simple drawing style suitable for a student with emerging understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw basic elements like fish in water and birds in trees, fulfilling the 'CAN' part. However, it also reflects struggles with correct and consistent labeling, possibly incorrect or unclear placement of labels, and lack of elements like the sun or detailed interactions between flora and fauna. This aligns with the 'CANNOT' parts, showing a developing understanding."
