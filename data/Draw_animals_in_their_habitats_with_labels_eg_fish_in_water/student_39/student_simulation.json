  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing some animals in their habitats. I remember that fish live in water, so I'll draw a fish swimming in a river. I'll make sure to label 'fish' and 'water' for the river. I know bears live in forests, so I'll draw a bear near some trees, and label 'bear' and 'forest.' For a bird, I'll draw it in the sky or sitting in a tree and label 'bird' and 'tree.' I'll include a human too, maybe in a field, and label 'human' and 'field.' I remember that animals need resources, so I'll try to show the river as water for the fish, and maybe a fruit tree for the bear. But I might forget to label the air for the bird. I need to show these different elements working together, like how fish need water, but I might not get all the labels perfect, especially for things like forest types.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting a colorful outdoor scene with various animals in their natural habitats. In the water, there is a fish labeled 'fish' and 'water.' On land, a bear is next to green trees labeled 'bear' and 'forest.' A bird is either in a tree or up in the blue sky, labeled 'bird' and 'tree,' but possibly missing any air label. A human is standing in a grassy field, labeled 'human' and 'field.' The drawing style is simple, using bright colors, with clear, bold labels on the main elements. The resources like water and food are part of the drawing, but some connections and labels, such as 'air,' might be omitted.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label general animals and habitats like fish in water or bears in forests. They can show resources like water and food for the fish and bear but may miss specific details or connections, like labeling 'air' for birds or correctly labeling every habitat feature. The student's drawing shows both effort and some misunderstanding, aligned with the level description of being proficient with room for improvement."
