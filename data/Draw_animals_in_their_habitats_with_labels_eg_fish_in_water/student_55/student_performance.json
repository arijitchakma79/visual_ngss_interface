  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw and label common animals in their appropriate habitats, such as a fish in water or a deer in a forest.",
    "The student can include basic needs of animals, like water for fish and leaves for deer, although might miss some specific details.",
    "The student can show general environments like forests and lakes where animals live, labeling them.",
    "The student can somewhat illustrate how animals depend on their environments, for example, including water for fish but missing smaller details like oxygen in water.",
    "The student can show basic relationships between environments and what they provide, such as sunlight and water for plants."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may miss subtler interactions, such as the role of soil quality in plant health or how specific fish get nutrients from their environment *(student sees water as a single resource)*.",
    "Illustrations might lack some detail in how plants and animals form a complete system, focusing more on direct relationships than the whole ecosystem *(student sees elements as separate rather than interlinked)*.",
    "Some labels might be missing or less precise, especially for less familiar elements *(student prioritizes major elements like 'forest' over specific species)*."
