  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw some animals in their appropriate habitats (e.g., a fish in a water setting or a bird in a tree).",
    "The student can label basic features of the habitat such as 'water' or 'tree'.",
    "The student can show some basic needs of animals or plants in the drawing (e.g., a plant near the sun for light)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot consistently illustrate how plants and animals fully interact with their environment (e.g., missing elements like the fish needing water besides just living in it).",
    "The student may struggle to explain how habitats provide specific resources for survival (e.g., doesn't show deer getting food from trees, may label tree but not show its importance).",
    "The student may not accurately demonstrate the relationship between organisms and their needs (e.g., a bird might be in a tree but without explanation or labels showing why tree is important for shelter or food).",
    "The student may misunderstand that environments are a system of interdependent components (e.g., shows plants and animals as independent rather than interconnected)."
