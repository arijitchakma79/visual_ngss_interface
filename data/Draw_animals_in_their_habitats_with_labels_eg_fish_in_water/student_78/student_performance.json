  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw animals and some plants in their natural habitats, although the details might be simplistic or inconsistent.",
    "The student can label basic habitats such as 'water' for fish and 'forest' for deer, but may not include all relevant habitats.",
    "The student can show some needs of animals, like drawing water near a fish or land near a rabbit.",
    "The student may represent basic relationships where an animal is within its environment, like a bird in a tree, but without clear connections to resources."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to illustrate complex interactions between animals and their environments, such as how plants provide oxygen or how specific resources are used by animals (student doesnâ€™t know this).",
    "The student might not label all the environmental components that meet the needs of each animal, missing items like air or specific food sources (student thinks water and land are the only needs).",
    "The student may misunderstand the complete system where animals and plants meet their needs, potentially drawing resources incorrectly or vaguely representing them (e.g., fish floating above water, rather than in it).",
    "The student might misunderstand or oversimplify the relationship between animals and their habitats, sometimes placing animals in inappropriate settings or omitting key environmental elements (student thinks a field is the same as a forest)."
