  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big, blue blob for the water because fish live in water. I remember fish need water, and they swim in it, so I'll draw a simple fish shape inside the blue area. I'm labeling this part 'water' so it's clear. Next, I'll draw a green area for a forest and I'll put a deer in it. I'll make sure the deer is standing on grass since deer live on land. I'll label this area 'forest.' Now, I want to draw a bird. I know birds like to be in trees, so I'll draw a simple tree and place the bird sitting on one of its branches. I’ll label that 'tree.' I know animals need things like food and water, but I'm not really sure how to show that, so I’ll just focus on where they live for now. I also heard that plants help animals, but I'm not sure how to draw that. Lastly, I'll try to show a rabbit. Rabbits are on land, so I'll draw it hopping around the grass, kind of near the deer in the forest area. I’ll label this area with 'land' as well.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing depicting a simple landscape with various animals in their habitats. In the foreground, a blue area marked as 'water' contains a basic fish drawing. Adjacent, a green section labeled 'forest' has a deer standing on grass. Nearby, a tree holds a bird on a branch labeled 'tree.' Off to the side, a rabbit is shown hopping on grass labeled 'land.' The drawing uses bright and simple colors, characteristic of a developing student's work.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities by focusing on their capacity to draw basic animals in simple habitats like water and forest, and label them. The student shows some understanding by placing a fish in water and a deer on land but struggles with more detailed elements like food sources or complete ecosystems. This limitation is represented by the lack of detailed interactions and resources in the image."
