  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw basic shapes that might represent animals or plants, though they lack detail (e.g., a circle for a fish or a stick figure for a human).",
    "Use simple labels like 'fish,' 'tree,' or 'water,' though placement might be incorrect (e.g., 'fish' might be placed on land).",
    "Enthusiastically add some colors which might not correspond to the logical colors for elements (e.g., grass might be orange instead of green)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Correctly illustrate the necessary resources for survival, often missing key elements like water or air (e.g., *(the student does not include water around the fish)*).",
    "Show or label the relationships between animals and their resources clearly, often omitting or mislabeling (e.g., *(the student draws a fish next to a sun instead of in water)*).",
    "Demonstrate understanding of how habitats meet specific needs, such as food or shelter (e.g., *(the student places a deer on a barren land with no trees or leaves)*).",
    "Show how plants and animals are part of a system and depend on their environment (e.g., *(the student draws elements disconnected with no context)*).",
    "Include humans using natural resources in a meaningful way, often showing humans without clear context or resources (e.g., *(a human floating in the air)*)."
