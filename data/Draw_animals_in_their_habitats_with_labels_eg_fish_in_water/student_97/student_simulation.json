  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big circle because circles are easy, and I can make that into a fish. I'll make the circle blue since blue is a nice color, but I guess that's good for a fish. I'll write 'fish' next to it. I’ll draw straight lines for the fish’s fins and tail. Next, I remember there's water for fish. I'll try drawing some wavy lines underneath, but I’m not sure if these lines look like water waves or land. I'll make them green because I like green here. Now, I want to add a tree, which is just a tall rectangle. I'll label it 'tree,' but it could be anywhere, so I’ll put it next to the fish. It will be a purple color because I want it to be bright. Then, I'll add an orange for a sun because I like the sun, and everyone thinks orange is sunny. Finally, I'll do a stick figure for a human and add red to him since that looks cool. I’m not sure where the human belongs, so I'll just put him above the fish and tree.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a child's drawing showing a big blue circle labeled 'fish'. Underneath are green wavy lines meant to represent water. Next to the circle, is a purple tall rectangle labeled 'tree'. An orange circle in the corner represents the sun. Draw a red stick-figure human floating above the fish and tree. Use bright, mismatched colors with simple shapes resembling a child's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw simple shapes and add basic labels like 'fish' or 'tree', but incorrectly places elements and uses illogical colors, like an orange sun or green water. The student creates an image without depicting correct habitats, illustrating minimal or no understanding of the concept, aligning with the student's identified abilities and errors."
