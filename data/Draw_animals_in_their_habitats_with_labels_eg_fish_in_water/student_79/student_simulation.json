  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a large piece of water to show where fish live. I know fish need water to survive, so I'll make sure to draw a few fish swimming in the water. I'll also add some seaweed because fish need plants around them, even though I sometimes forget to show it connecting to animals. Now, let's draw a forest habitat. Deer live in forests, so I'll draw some trees and place a deer among them. Deer need plants to eat, so I'll show some grass. I remember they need water too, but I might forget to label the air as a resource. I'll also draw a field with rabbits. Rabbits need fields with grass and plants, so I'll make sure to show that. Now, I'll label each animal and its habitat. Fish in water, deer in forest, and rabbit in fields. I'll also label the water and the grass as resources for their habitats. Oops, I forgot to label air, but I hope itâ€™s okay since I showed most of what they need.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing showing three different habitats in a single scene. On the left, there's a body of water colored in light blue with several cartoon-like fish swimming, labeled 'Fish in Water' and 'Water' as a resource. In the center, a forest scene with green trees and a brown deer walking on green grass, labeled 'Deer in Forest' and 'Grass.' On the right, a field with a rabbit hopping on the grass, marked 'Rabbit in Field.' Each label is written in large, legible letters. The style is colorful and simple, with bold outlines and bright colors, capturing an elementary student's drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label animals in their habitats correctly, such as a fish in water and a deer in a forest. It includes essential resources labeled, like water and grass, which show the student's understanding of basic resource needs. However, it does not include air as a labeled resource, aligning with what the student struggles with. The drawing style suggests effort and proficiency expected at this level, while the lack of interconnectedness between plants and animals highlights the student's challenge in seeing the full system interactions."
