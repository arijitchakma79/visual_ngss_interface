  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw different animals such as fish, deer, and rabbits within their appropriate habitats, like water, forests, and fields.",
    "The student can label resources that are essential for animals and plants, such as water and sunlight, showing a basic understanding of what these organisms need to survive.",
    "The student is able to show the relationship between animals and their habitats, like how fish live in water environments and deer live in forests.",
    "The student can illustrate how animals get what they need, such as fish obtaining oxygen from water.",
    "The student can label the resources each habitat provides that support the organisms living there."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label all the necessary resources for each habitat (e.g., forgets to label 'air' as a resource).",
    "The student might partially misunderstand the full system interaction, potentially missing the idea that plants and animals together with their habitats form a system (e.g., might not explicitly link plants' needs to animals' needs)."
