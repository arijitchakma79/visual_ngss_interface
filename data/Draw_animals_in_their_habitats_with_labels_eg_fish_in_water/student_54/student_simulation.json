  "Reasoning": "Alright, I need to draw animals in their habitats. First, I'll think about a fish. I know fish live in water, so I'll start with that. I can draw a fish shape and then put it inside some wavy lines to show water. I'll write the word 'fish' next to it and maybe 'water' too. Now, what about a bird? Birds live in trees, right? I'll draw a tree with a simple trunk and branches. Then I'll make a basic bird with a round body and stick-like wings in the tree. I'll label it with 'bird' and 'tree'. Hmm, I think that's good, but I'm not sure if I need to show all the parts of the habitats like rocks in water or leaves on the tree. I know animals live where they can find what they need, but making them interact, like showing the bird eating leaves, seems a bit tough for me. At least I put them in the right places. Maybe I'll add some ground for the tree, but I won't label the sun or sky since I'm unsure how they fit in. I'll try to keep it simple so I don't mix things like putting the fish in the tree.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a colorful, child-like art style image featuring a fish in water and a bird in a tree. The fish should be a basic shape, swimming in water illustrated by wavy blue lines. Next to the fish, label it with the word 'fish' and also label the water. Include a tree with a simple brown trunk and green branches, where a basic bird with a round body and wings is sitting. Label the bird and the tree. Use simple bold colors reflecting a child's drawing, with sparse details and a flat, playful style to reflect a developing understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to identify basic animal shapes and habitats. The inclusion of labels for the fish and bird shows they understand placement but don't grasp complex interactions. While they accurately place a fish in water and a bird in a tree, the image avoids complexities like animal interaction with plants, illustrating the student's emerging but limited understanding of ecological systems. The playful, child-like art style reflects their developing skills and comprehension."
