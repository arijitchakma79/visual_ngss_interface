  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw basic shapes of animals and label them, such as a fish in water or a bird in a tree.",
    "The student can partially represent some typical habitats, such as a pond for fish or a tree for a bird, though details might be sparse or inconsistent.",
    "The student may show a basic understanding of the concept that animals live in places that help them meet their basic needs (e.g., fish need water)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show more complex interactions between animals and their environments, like deer eating leaves, beyond labeling or basic representation (student doesnâ€™t fully grasp this interaction).",
    "The student might incorrectly label a habitat or mix different habitats for an animal (e.g., putting a fish in a forest) (student has an emerging understanding of habitat relevance).",
    "The student might not effectively demonstrate the relationship between plants, animals, and resources like sunlight or air (student may not understand or show indirect relationships).",
    "Complex systems interactions, where plants, animals, and environments are shown working together, are likely oversimplified or missing (student struggles to represent systems thinking)."
