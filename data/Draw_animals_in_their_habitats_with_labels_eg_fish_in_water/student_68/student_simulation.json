  "Reasoning": "I'll start by thinking about different kinds of animals and where they live. I remember that fish live in water, like a river, so I'll draw a river with fish swimming in it. These fish need water to swim, so I'll make sure it looks like they're under the water. Then, I'll move on to the forest. I can draw a large tree and add some birds in the branches because that's their habitat. I'll also draw a deer on the ground, surrounded by grass. Grass is important for the deer because they eat it. I shouldn't forget to draw sunlight and label the tree 'forest' because that's where it belongs. I also want to add a few plants, like flowers and shrubs, to show the variety in the forest. For each animal and plant, I need to label their habitats and resources, like ‘river’ for fish and ‘forest’ for the deer and birds. I might forget a small plant or overlook a hidden detail like a small rock, but I'll do my best. I should make the drawing colorful to show the environment is alive, using blue for the river, green for the forest, and brown for the deer. Lastly, I'll label everything so it's easy to understand which animal goes with which habitat and what resources they need.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed and colorful drawing of a natural environment showing various animals in their habitats. A river with fish swimming, labeled 'river', using shades of blue to represent water. A forest scene with trees, labeled 'forest', and birds resting in branches. A deer standing on grass, with grass labeled as the deer's food source. The sun shining down, providing sunlight for plants. Various plants like flowers and shrubs to show plant diversity in the forest. Use bright, natural colors like green for the trees and grass, blue for the river, and brown for the deer. The drawing should have clear labels for the habitats and resources, demonstrating an understanding of how nature provides for animals and plants.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately depict a variety of animals and their respective habitats. The student can identify and label relationships between organisms and their environments, such as fish in the river or deer in the forest, and their necessary resources, like grass for deer. The prompt aligns with their skill level by including detailed and labeled components, yet acknowledges possible minor omissions like small plants or environmental features, corresponding to the occasional oversight described."
