  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a variety of animals, including humans, and place them accurately within their natural habitats, such as fish in water and deer in a forest.",
    "The student can label the specific places each animal lives, like 'water,' 'forest,' and 'grassland' for different species.",
    "The student can identify and accurately label the essential resources needed by each plant and animal, such as water for fish, air for birds, and sunlight for plants.",
    "The student can illustrate and label how animals use these resources for survival, such as showing animals drinking water or basking in sunlight.",
    "The student can demonstrate interconnected relationships and roles in a habitat, showing how different species interact, such as birds eating insects or beavers building dams in rivers.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate how the environment supports each plant and animal by showing sunlight aiding plant growth or trees providing shelter to animals.",
    "The student can demonstrate that plants, animals, habitats, and resources form an interconnected system by showing how changes in one element affect others (e.g., how deforestation might impact bird populations)."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit a label or provide incomplete information for more complex relationships (e.g., not labeling all necessary resources for an animal).",
    "In rare instances, the student might inaccurately depict a resource or mislabel an animal behavior, although these are minimal and do not detract from the overall understanding."
