  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a few different animals in their habitats. First, I’ll start with a fish because I know it lives in water. I’ll draw a big blue pond and put a fish inside it. I'll label it 'fish in water'. Next, I’ll draw a forest with a deer. I know deer live in forests. I’ll make sure to label it 'deer in forest'. Now, I remember birds need air to fly. I’ll draw a bird in the air with 'bird in air' label. I could add another animal, maybe a beaver because they build dams in rivers. I'll draw a river with a dam and a beaver nearby, labeled 'beaver building dam'. I'll show the sun shining to indicate sunlight, which is needed by all living things. Oops, I almost missed labeling how the deer drinks water from a stream nearby. I’ll draw it drinking from a small stream. For plants, I'll add trees and label that they use sunlight to grow. Hopefully, I've remembered to include everything, even if I might forget a label here and there. Overall, I feel I've captured the relationships and resources well.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing showing a variety of animals in their respective habitats: a fish in a blue pond labeled 'fish in water', a deer in a green forest labeled 'deer in forest', a bird labeled 'bird in air' flying in the sky, and a beaver next to a dam in a river labeled 'beaver building dam'. The scene includes a sun shining above, trees labeled 'using sunlight', and a small stream where the deer drinks water, labeled 'deer drinking water'. The style is child-like and vibrant, capturing the essence of each habitat with clear, bold labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do because it includes a variety of animals accurately placed within their natural habitats and labeled accordingly. It demonstrates understanding of the essential resources needed by each species, like the fish in water and the bird in the air. The prompt also reflects the student's ability to demonstrate interactions, like the beaver building a dam. While the student might omit a label or provide incomplete information on complex interactions, such details do not detract significantly from the overall representation of interconnected systems in nature."
