  "Reasoning": "I will try to draw an animal in its habitat. First, I think of a fish. I'll start with the fish shape; maybe a roundish body with a triangle for the tail, and two lines for fins. Now, I’m thinking about where it lives. Fish live in water, right? So, I'll add some blue wavy lines next to the fish to show it's in the water. I remember I should label this. I’ll write 'fish' next to it. Do I need to draw something it needs? What else is there? Maybe I’ll draw a tree, because trees are everywhere, right? I'll put a tree near the fish. Wait, do I label the water? I’m not sure how to label that. I don't know if fish live with trees, but I can't think of anything else to add.",
  "Prompt": "A naive drawing by a young student: a simplistic fish shape with a round body and a triangle tail in a child-like style. Next to the fish are blue squiggly lines meant to represent water. Near the fish, there's a simple tree with a brown trunk and green leaves. There is a label 'fish' close to the fish, but no label for the water. The style is juvenile and lacks detail, with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes resembling animals, like a simple fish shape. The student attempts to depict the habitat by adding blue lines for water, but the habitat representation is unclear and lacks context, as they might add unrelated elements like a tree next to a fish. The labeling is incomplete, with only 'fish' labeled and incorrect or missing labels for habitats like water, matching how the student misunderstands habitat needs and connections. Overall, this matches the student's minimal understanding described in the task level."
