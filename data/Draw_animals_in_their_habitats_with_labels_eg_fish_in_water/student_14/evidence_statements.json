  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw different plants and animals, including humans, and label them.",
    "The student can represent and label the places where these plants and animals live (e.g., water, forests, fields).",
    "The student can show and label the things that plants and animals need to survive, such as water, air, sunlight, and food.",
    "The student can illustrate and describe how animals and plants get what they need from their habitats (e.g., fish swim in water, deer eat leaves in forests).",
    "The student can explain, through the drawing, the relationship between habitats and the resources they provide (e.g., lakes provide water for fish, forests offer leaves for deer).",
