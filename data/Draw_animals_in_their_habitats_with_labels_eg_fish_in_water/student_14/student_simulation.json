  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big area with wavy blue lines. This will be water for the fish. I remember that fish live in water, so I should put a fish here. Next, I'll draw a simple fish shape, kind of like an oval with a pointy end and some fins. I can label it 'fish'. Then, I’ll add a few plants to go along with the water, like tall wiggly lines for seaweed. I'm not really sure how the fish and the water interact beyond living in it, so I won’t add more details there. I'll add a sun in the sky by drawing a circle and lines coming off it, then label it 'sun'. I think the sun is important for something, maybe the plants need it. I won't add anything else since I remember that animals need things like food, but I’m not sure how to draw it or label it right now.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a childlike scene depicting a simple underwater habitat. In the center, place a drawn fish with basic features like a body, tail, and fins. Color the fish in bright colors, like orange. Label the fish 'fish'. Surround it by wavy blue lines to represent water. Add simple green wiggly lines labeled 'seaweed' to represent plants in the water. Include a sun with a face in the corner of the picture, drawn as a yellow circle with radiating lines, labeled 'sun'. The drawing should have a naive and childlike style, with simple, bold outlines and flat colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities as it includes basic shapes and simple labeling, like the fish and seaweed in a water environment. It shows the student can label the fish in a general habitat area. The drawing style is childlike, reflecting the student's developing level. The prompt does not include complex interactions or specific resource uses, aligning with the student's difficulty in depicting the relationship between animals and resources in their habitats."
