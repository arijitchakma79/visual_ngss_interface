  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw an animal in its habitat. I think I'll start with a fish. I’ve seen fish in water, so I should try to create that. I'll draw a long oval shape—it's kind of like the fish in my head. Now, for the water, I'll draw a big circle around it. Hmm, I guess water should cover this circle. What else? Oh, labels! I should write 'fish' next to my oval shape, but I'm not sure if I need a label for the water – maybe it's not that important. Or should I label it 'water'? I'll write 'water' under the circle. It feels right, I hope it is. I don't remember what else fish need, so I won't add anything else.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of an oval shape representing a fish, placed inside a large circle meant to represent water. There is a basic label 'fish' near the oval shape and another label 'water' near the circle. Drawn with bright colors, like blue for the water and a random color for the fish, using a childlike crayon style with rough, wobbly lines.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's attempt to draw a fish and water, but with minimal or no distinctive features, reflecting their lack of clear understanding. The drawing includes labels, but as expected, they may be mismatched or incorrectly placed. The depiction lacks any indication of resources or habitat features necessary for the survival of the fish, consistent with the student's limitations at this level."
