  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw a basic animal but might not clearly depict or label what it is (e.g., drawing a vague shape that could be an animal).",
    "The student might draw a simple shape to represent a habitat, though it may not include any distinctive features (e.g., a circle meant to represent a body of water)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to clearly label different plants and animals correctly (e.g., mismatched labels or no labels at all).",
    "The student may not draw the places where plants and animals live in a recognizable way (e.g., drawing grass as water).",
    "The student might struggle to identify or illustrate the resources animals need to survive (e.g., not drawing air or water).",
    "The student is unlikely to show the relationship between an animal and the materials it needs to survive (e.g., a fish outside of water).",
    "The student may not represent connections between habitats and resources (e.g., no indication of resources like soil, air, or water in the drawing).",
    "The drawing may not illustrate how habitats meet the needs of plants and animals (e.g., animals and resources drawn separately with no relation)."
