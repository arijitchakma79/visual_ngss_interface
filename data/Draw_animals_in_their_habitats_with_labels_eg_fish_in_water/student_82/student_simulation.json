  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a fish first. I remember fish live in the water, so I'll draw some wavy lines for the water. Next, I'll draw a tree because trees are part of nature too. I'll label them 'fish' and 'tree'. I know fish need water to swim, so I’ll draw the fish in the water. I should draw a bird, but I'm not sure what makes its habitat. I might put it in the sky because I know birds fly there. I remember to write 'water' next to the fish. For the tree, I’ll leave it by itself; I think trees can just be there. I might forget about the soil because I'm not sure about all the plant stuff. I'll use crayons or markers, making everything colorful. Fish is blue, water is blue too. Tree is green with a brown trunk. Bird will be in the sky but I won't label anything else because I'm not sure what is needed. I'm trying to remember but it's a bit hard to think about complex things like what all plants and animals need.",
  "Prompt": "A child's colorful drawing showing a simple fish in blue water, labeled 'fish' and 'water'. Next to it, a green tree with a brown trunk, labeled 'tree'. A bird is flying in the sky but not labeled with a habitat. The drawing should have the look of being done with crayons or markers, with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do as they include a fish labeled with its basic habitat of water and a tree without additional resources. The tree and fish are correctly labeled, demonstrating emerging understanding. The student lacks complexity, not labeling resources like soil for the tree, and mixing up or inadequately illustrating habitats for other animals like the bird."
