  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish, because I know fish live in water. I remember they have fins, so I'll draw a few fins on the fish. Now, I need to draw the water around it. I might forget to show how the fish uses the water, like for breathing. Next, I think about another animal – maybe a bird. Birds are in the sky, so I’ll draw one with wings. I wonder if trees would be good to draw here; I think about adding a tree and putting a bird in it, even though not all birds live in trees. I’ll try to label the fish and the water, and also the bird and maybe the sky, but I might not label the air for the bird. I’ll make the sky blue, water blue too, fish can have some colors like gray or blue, and the bird might be red. I might forget the connection between the fish or bird and their environment, like how birds use air or how some birds need specific trees.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing showing a fish labeled 'fish' in blue water labeled 'water' and a bird labeled 'bird' flying near a tree and the sky, without labels for air. The fish is gray and blue, the bird is red, water and sky are blue, and the tree has green leaves and a brown trunk. The drawing has a simple, crayon-like style with basic shapes and vibrant colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's developing understanding by showing animals and their habitats correctly but with some labels or ecological interaction details missing. The fish is in water, and a bird is drawn in a tree and the sky, showcasing some basic habitat knowledge. The prompt omits labels for air, aligning with the student’s struggle to provide comprehensive labeling and represent how animals interact with their environments."
