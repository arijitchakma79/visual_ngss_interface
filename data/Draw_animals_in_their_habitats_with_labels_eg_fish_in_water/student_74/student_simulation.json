  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw some animals and their habitats. I'll start with an animal I know well - a fish. First, I'll draw the fish. I think it should be in water because I remember fish need water to live. Next to the fish, I'll draw some little waves or lines to show that it's in water. I'll label the fish 'fish' and the water 'water'. I remember trees being in forests, so I'll draw a tree too. This tree will be in the forest. I'll just draw a big tree and some lines for the ground to show the forest floor. Oops, I think I should label the tree as 'tree' and try to remember what a forest looks like, but I'm not so sure. I'll put 'forest' near the tree even though I'm not sure it's really right. Now, I know animals need things to live, like food and water. I already drew the water near the fish, so that's good. I don't really know about sunlight for plants, but I think fish just need water. I hope I didn't mix up where I'm supposed to put each label. I think I've got the main ideas down, though.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a scene showing a fish in water and a tree in a simple habitat. The fish is roughly drawn with wavy water lines indicating that it's underwater. Nearby, the word 'fish' is labeled on the fish and 'water' on the water, although the water could be confused to look like a pond. There is a simple tree drawn with a brown trunk and green leaves. 'Tree' is labeled on the tree, and 'forest' is placed near it without much context for forest surroundings. The drawing uses bright colors and looks like crayon art.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by having basic animals like a fish and a tree, with their respective habitats, water and forest, being labeled. The prompt also shows the student's struggle with consistently labeling and illustrating complex interactions with the habitat, such as showing how sunlight affects plant growth. The use of simple bright colors and crayon style reflects a developing understanding level of depicting these elements."
