  "Reasoning": "I know I'm supposed to draw animals in their habitats. Okay, first I'm going to try drawing a fish. I think a fish is kind of an oval shape, so I'll draw that. I'm not sure how to do the fins and stuff, but that's okay. I want it to look like it's in water, so I'll use some blue around it, but I'll just do that above the fish because I'm not sure where else to put it. Now, I'll try drawing a bird. I think birds have wings and a beak. I'll draw it in the sky, but my sky might look like just a patch of blue on the side. And I want a tree. I'll make it brown and green. Maybe the bird can be near that, somewhere. I feel like I'm missing something, so I'll draw a bunch of wavy lines for grass. That kind of goes everywhere too. Let me add some labels. I'll write 'fish' next to the oval and 'bird' somewhere near the big blue sky spot. Labels help a lot, but not sure if everything is right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple and child-like scene showing one colorful blob-like fish with very basic features partially submerged in blue water, but the water is incorrectly placed above the fish. Draw a basic bird shape in the sky, which is a separate patch of blue, and a green and brown tree nearby. Add some wavy lines all around for grass. Include labels like 'fish' next to the fish blob and 'bird' near the bird, even if they're not in the right place. Use crayon or thick marker style, making it appear untidy or random with bright, mismatched colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's can-do abilities by depicting fairly simple, vaguely recognizable forms of a fish and bird, but labels help identify them despite misplaced environments, with incorrect habitat placements showing the student's misunderstanding. The stylized crayons capture the beginner's level by showing energetic but unrefined drawing efforts and misaligned resource representation."
