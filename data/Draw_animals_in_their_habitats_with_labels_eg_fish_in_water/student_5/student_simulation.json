  "Reasoning": "I think I should draw an animal like a fish. I’ll start by drawing a simple fish shape with a pointed tail and a round body. I remember fish are in water, but I'm not really sure how to show that, so maybe I’ll just draw some squiggly lines around the fish to show water. I'm gonna try to put some grass too because I think plants are everywhere, but I'm not sure where they should go, so I’ll just put them randomly around the fish. I think I'll label my drawing, but I'm not confident about what to write. I'll label the fish as 'Fish' so people know what it is, and maybe write 'Water' somewhere around it because I think fish need water, but I'm not too sure about how exactly they live in it.",
  "Prompt": "A simplistic child's drawing of a fish. The fish is a basic oval shape with a pointed tail, drawn in a flat blue color. There are wavy, squiggly lines nearby to suggest water but they are not well defined. Random patches of bright green grass are scattered around the drawing, not specifically connected to the fish or water. The word 'Fish' is labeled near the fish, and 'Water' is written nearby, but the placement isn't logically linked. The drawing lacks detailed habitat context and logical relationships between elements.",
  "Explanation": "The prompt captures what the student can do: they draw a basic animal with minimal detail and label it simply. It also reflects what they struggle with: associating animals correctly with distinct habitats, logically connecting resources to survival, and organizing elements coherently to represent a habitat. There is an attempt to include grass randomly, showing a vague environment without proper context, and labels that are not confidently placed."
