  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in a body of water. I know fish need water to live, so I’ll carefully draw a blue pond with seaweed and label it 'water'. Next, I’ll draw a deer in the forest. I remember that forests have trees, so I'll sketch a few trees, but I might forget to label one of them because I’m focused on the deer. I'll add grass and label it as 'forest'. Now, for the sky, I'll draw a bird flying high. I’ll label 'sky' and draw a sun for sunlight. I want to show how the environment helps animals, so I'll draw a line from the grass to the deer and label it 'food' and a line from the sun to the trees as 'sunlight'. I need to show how these parts work together, so I’ll add arrows linking animals to their environment. I might make the river too big, but I think the important parts will still look right.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing of animals in their habitats: a fish in a blue pond with seaweed labeled 'water', and a slightly oversized river; a deer in a green forest with a few trees, forgetting to label one; a bird flying in a bright blue sky with a labeled 'sky'; the sun shining above. Includes arrows pointing from grass to deer labeled 'food' and from sun to trees labeled 'sunlight'. The style is colorful and represents a child's advanced drawing level with minor scale inaccuracies.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student’s ability to accurately draw and label environments, highlighting their advanced understanding of ecosystems. It allows for minor labeling omissions or scale issues consistent with what they struggle with while still depicting a coherent interaction between animals and their habitats."
