  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish. I remember fish live in water, so I’ll draw some wavy lines to show water around the fish. I’ll label the fish with a tag that says 'Fish in water'. Next, I want to draw a bird. I know birds like trees, so I’ll draw a simple tree with a bird sitting on a branch. I’ll label the bird with a tag that says 'Bird in tree'. Now, I’ll think about what else these animals need. Fish need water, and I think birds need trees, but I'm not sure what else to show for the bird. I’m going to add the sun in the sky since plants need sunlight. I’ll label the sun too. I'm not sure how air fits in or the idea of an ecosystem, so I won’t draw that. I know these parts of the habitat are important, but I'm not sure how they all connect together.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a fish in blue water and a bird in a green tree. The fish is labeled 'Fish in water', and the bird is labeled 'Bird in tree'. There's a sun drawn above in a bright yellow color, labeled 'Sun'. The overall style is simple and colorful, with basic shapes and labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label simple animals in their immediate habitats, such as a fish in water and a bird in a tree. The inclusion of the sun depicts a basic understanding of resources needed by plants. The lack of additional details such as air for the bird and broader ecosystem connections reflects the student's struggles with more advanced concepts and systems thinking."
