  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing animals. I remember we did a drawing of a fish before, so I’ll make a circle and add some lines for fins. Next, I’ll try to draw a dog. Dogs have four legs, so I’ll make an oval with four lines coming down. I’m supposed to add the habitats, right? Hmm, I know fish have something to do with water, but I’m not sure, so I’ll just put the fish next to the dog. I think trees go with dogs because I’ve seen dogs sniffing around them. I’ll draw some lollipop trees—a circle on a stick. Now, I need to label them: 'fish' for the fish, even though it's on the land, 'dog' for the dog, and maybe 'tree' for trees. Hmm, I need more things. Let’s write 'grass' under both the dog and the fish, even if they’re next to each other.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like scene featuring a fish drawn as a circle with lines for fins, positioned on the ground next to a dog represented by an oval with four line legs. Include several lollipop-shaped trees (circles on sticks) around them. Add basic labels in a child’s handwriting: 'fish' next to the fish, 'dog' next to the dog, and 'tree' next to the trees. Label the ground as 'grass'. Use bright colors like blue for the fish, brown for the dog, green for the trees, and light green for the grass. The style should be naive and effortful, reflecting the drawing abilities of a young child.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's abilities by using simple shapes to represent the animals and includes some basic labeling. The fish is placed incorrectly on land, next to the dog, showing a misunderstanding of habitats. Similarly, the labeling of everything as 'grass' under the fish also illustrates the student's struggle with accurate representation of environments and relationships in nature."
