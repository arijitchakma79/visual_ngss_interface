    "Illustrate and accurately label different habitats where plants and animals live (student likely mixes up where different animals belong, such as drawing a fish on land).",
    "Show the relationship between animals and their habitats, such as fish needing water (student might put animals in unrelated environments without clear reasoning, like a bird under water).",
    "Represent the resources that animals need from their habitats (student might forget to include elements like water or plants or might incorrectly place them, like putting trees under water).",
    "Consistently use labels to show how the habitat provides necessary resources for survival (student might label everything as 'grass' without regard for accuracy)."
