  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw some animals in their habitats. First, I'll draw a fish. Fish live in water, so I'll try to draw some waves or maybe some blue lines to show the water. I know fish need water, so I'll label that. Next, I'm thinking of a deer. Hmm, do deer live in forests? I think so, but I'm not sure, so I'll just draw some grass around the deer and a tree because deer are seen in forests sometimes. I'll label the grass, but maybe not the forest since I'm not sure. I want to add a bird too. Birds live in trees, so I'll put a bird on the tree's branches and label 'tree.' I hope I'm getting this right.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a simple, colorful scene. On the left, there's a fish with blue waves labeled 'water.' In the center, a deer stands on green grass, with a small tree nearby. The tree has a bird on its branch. The grass is labeled, but the forest isn't clearly indicated. The style is child-like and basic, with bold colors and simple shapes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities and misunderstandings. They correctly associate the fish with water and label it, but their depiction of the deer shows a basic connection to grass without clear emphasis on its need for a forest habitat, which matches the student's level of understandingâ€”basic but incomplete. Additionally, their drawing includes a bird in a tree with the tree labeled, showing some recognition of habitat, though only partially accurate. The incomplete labeling and mixed information demonstrate the emerging understanding expected at the developing level."
