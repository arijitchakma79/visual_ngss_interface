  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a forest scene because I know deer live there. I'll sketch some trees and bushes around the deer. I’ll label the deer and the trees, making sure I write clearly so it’s easy to read. Next, I’ll add a pond with a fish in the water and make sure to label them too. I'll draw a line and label it 'water' above the pond. I remember that plants need sunlight, so I’ll sketch the sun in the sky with lines coming from it and label it 'sunlight'. Then, I'll add some birds in the sky and insects like bees around the flowers under the trees. I will draw arrows from the flowers to the bees to show that relationship and another arrow from the sun to the plants. I might forget to label one of the arrows if I'm not careful, and I often struggle with drawing less common interactions, like birds eating insects, so I probably won’t include that. I should also remember to label the forest habitat itself.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed colored pencil drawing of a forest habitat. It features a deer among tall, leafy trees with underbrush. The deer and trees are labeled. A pond is included with a fish swimming in the water, also labeled, and the word 'water' positioned above it. Insects such as bees are buzzing around labeled flowers below the trees, with arrows connecting flowers and bees. The sun shines overhead, with rays extending down and a label 'sunlight'. Birds are in the sky, but interactions like birds eating insects are not illustrated. The style is illustrative, capturing a vibrant and natural look.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate and label a variety of plants, animals, and their essential elements for survival like water and sunlight. It includes correct habitats such as a forest with labeled components and dependencies shown with arrows. The minor omissions like forgetting to label an arrow and missing less common ecosystem interactions mirror the described gaps while maintaining an advanced understanding overall."
