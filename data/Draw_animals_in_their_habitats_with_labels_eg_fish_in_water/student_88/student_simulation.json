  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw various animals in their habitats, like fish in a river and birds in trees. I need to label everything clearly. For the fish, I’ll label the river itself and indicate that it provides water. For the birds, I'll make sure to show the trees and label them. I’ll indicate that trees provide shelter and maybe fruits. I’ll also include a few plants in the soil, labeling them and noting that they need sunlight and water. I want to include sunlight coming down on the scene and label it by the sun. I remember that all these elements need to show how they depend on each other. For instance, I'll draw a rabbit near a bush, showing it eats the plants. I’ll try to connect the rabbit to the bush with a small arrow, showing a basic food relationship, and I’ll label those too. I want the whole drawing to depict a system, with arrows indicating resource flows. Sometimes labeling everything correctly can be tricky, and it might be easy to forget to label something like sunlight or specific elements if the drawing gets too busy. I also need to be careful to not oversimplify, like making sure predators and prey are clearly linked if I include them, even if it makes the drawing complex.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful and detailed hand-drawn illustration of an ecosystem showing various animals and plants in their natural habitats. The image includes fish in a blue river labeled 'water', birds in green trees labeled 'trees', and a rabbit near a bush, with arrows and labels indicating it eats the plants. The sun is shining down, labeled 'sunlight', and there are small plants growing in brown soil labeled 'soil'. Arrows and labels throughout the image show the dependencies of these elements on one another, depicting a simple food chain. The drawing has vibrant colors and clear, hand-written labels. The style is that of an advanced student with detailed elements, capturing the complexity of an ecosystem, while slightly struggling with overcrowding labels and missing some nuanced connections in the food web.",
  "Explaination": "The student can accurately depict various ecosystems and include crucial elements like water, sunlight, and shelter, as well as label them correctly. They demonstrate the interdependence of lifeforms, such as showing rabbits eating plants. However, they might forget minor details or struggle with the complexity of more advanced elements, like a detailed food web, due to overcrowding or complexity, which aligns with their capabilities and challenges as described."
