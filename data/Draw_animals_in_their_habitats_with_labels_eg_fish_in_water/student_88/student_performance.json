  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw various types of animals and plants, including humans, accurately situated in their respective habitats.",
    "The student can clearly illustrate and accurately label the places where different animals and plants live (e.g., trees in a forest, fish in a river).",

    "The student can depict and label relationships between the animals/plants and the resources they need to survive (e.g., fish labeled in water, trees under sunlight).",
    "The student can demonstrate where animals and plants live and illustrate how those places provide necessary resources (e.g., a bird in a tree with a label pointing to fruits).",
    "The student can create drawings that explain how different animals and plants are part of a system, showing interdependence within ecosystems.",
