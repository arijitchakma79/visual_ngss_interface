  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a picture of a forest because I know that’s a common habitat for many animals and plants. I remember squirrels and birds live in trees, so I'll draw a tall tree with a squirrel on a branch and a bird sitting above it. I’ll make sure to label them with 'squirrel' and 'bird.' Birds need air to fly and nuts from trees, so I'll sketch an acorn on the branch near the squirrel. Trees provide shelter and food, so I’ll write ‘tree’ and ‘shelter’ next to it. Beneath the tree, I’ll draw grass and label it because rabbits eat grass; a rabbit will go here with a ‘rabbit’ label. I’ll also draw a sun in the sky, since sunlight is vital for plants to grow, but I sometimes forget to label it. I’ll add a stream nearby where a fish can swim, and label it ‘stream’ and ‘fish,’ remembering that fish need water. Nearby, I’ll draw some flowers and label them, as pollinators like bees come to them and I know about ecosystem interactions. I've got to be thorough with details so there are a variety of habitats shown.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed children's drawing of a forest habitat. Include a tall tree with a squirrel and a bird labeled 'squirrel' and 'bird'. Show an acorn on the branch and label it. Beneath the tree, draw grass with a rabbit labeled 'rabbit'. On the side, depict a small stream with a fish, labeled 'stream' and 'fish'. Include flowers labeled 'flowers' in the meadow. Draw a bright sun in the sky but leave the sun unlabeled. Use soft, bright colors and a detailed, realistic children's drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's ability to draw and label various animals and plants, and show the specific places they live. It includes accurate labels for organisms and their needs, like 'shelter' and 'stream', while occasionally forgetting to label extra details like sunlight. The multiple habitats demonstrate understanding of ecosystem interactions, although the sunlight, a minor detail, remains unlabeled."
