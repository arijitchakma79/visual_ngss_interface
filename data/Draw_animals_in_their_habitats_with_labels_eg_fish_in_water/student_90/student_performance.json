  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely omits some habitat details necessary for survival (e.g., might not include that fish need water to breathe).",
    "The student might not label specific resources needed for survival, like air and sunlight for plants (e.g., they may not know plants need sunlight or forget to label it).",
