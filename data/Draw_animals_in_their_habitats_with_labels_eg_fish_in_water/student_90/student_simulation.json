  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in the water because I know fish live there. I’ll show the fish swimming because they need water to move around. Next, I'll draw a tree because I know animals like squirrels or birds might live there, but I realize I’m not sure which ones to draw, so I’ll skip labeling them for now. I’ll draw a deer standing next to the tree because I know they live near forests. I think I should label 'water' for the fish because it's important. I might forget to write 'forest' next to the deer, though. I don’t remember if I should add sunlight or other resources they need, so I’ll leave that out. I feel like I covered what I remember animals need with the fish swimming in water.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing of a natural scene featuring a blue fish in water labeled 'water', showing it swimming. Draw a large brown tree with some green leaves next to it, and a brown deer standing near the tree. Do not label the tree or the area around the deer. Use bright, simple colors and a basic drawing style typical of a child learning about animal habitats.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by including a labeled fish swimming in water, showing the habitat animals live in. However, it doesn’t show the full habitat details, such as unlabeled forest areas or resources like sunlight, demonstrating the student’s developing understanding of the relationship between animals and their habitats."
