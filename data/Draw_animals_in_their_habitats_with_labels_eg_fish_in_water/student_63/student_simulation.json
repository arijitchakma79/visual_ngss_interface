  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in its natural habitat. I remember that fish live in water, so I need to make sure to draw a pond or a stream. I'll use blue to show the water and draw some wavy lines to indicate the movement of the water. Now, I'll add the fish, making sure it looks sleek and streamlined so it appears like it’s swimming. I'll label the water as 'water' because that's where the fish lives. Next, I'll draw a deer and add it to a forest. I’ll sketch some trees with green leaves around the deer, and I’ll label the area as 'forest.' I need to remember to label the sun because it's an important resource for light, especially for the plants in the forest. Let me see... I should connect how animals interact with their habitat, so I'll show the fish near the edge of the water, maybe as if it's hiding or looking for food. But I might forget to label the air for birds or plants because I'm focused on drawing the main elements like the fish and deer in their habitats.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a lively and colorful scene with a blue pond, showing a sleek fish in the water. Nearby, draw a forest with green trees and a brown deer standing among them. Add a bright yellow sun in the sky to provide light. Use labels to show 'water' for the pond and 'forest' for the trees and deer. This scene should be in a child-like art style, using bright colors and simple shapes to match the student's level of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by clearly depicting a fish in water and a deer in a forest, which they are proficient at illustrating. The student also includes labels like 'water' and 'forest' correctly, which they can do. The sun is added as a resource for plants, showing basic understanding of ecosystems. However, the student may struggle with more complex relationships, such as labeling air for birds or demonstrating how food systems work, which is reflected in the omission of these details in the drawing."
