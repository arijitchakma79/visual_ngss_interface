  "Reasoning": "Okay, I have to draw animals in their habitats. I remember that fish live in the water, so I'll start by drawing a fish. I'll draw it in some blue water, but I'm not sure if it's an ocean or a lake, so I'll just write 'water' next to it. Next, I'll draw a bird. I think birds live in trees, so I'll draw a green tree and place the bird on a branch. Let me label that 'tree'. Now, I'll draw another animal. I'll draw a deer, but I'm not really sure where they live. I'll just put it on some grass because I know they don't go in the water. Finally, I need to label my drawings. I can label 'fish', 'bird', and 'deer'. I'm not sure what else these animals need except for maybe food, but I know I should draw them in their habitats.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a simple representation of animal habitats: a fish in blue water labeled 'fish' and 'water', a bird in a green tree labeled 'bird' and 'tree', and a deer on green grass labeled 'deer'. Colors should be bright and basic, the drawing style should be simple and child-like, with some inconsistent or missing habitat details.",
  "Explaination": "The reasoning and prompt reflect what the student can do, like drawing basic animal and habitat representations and labeling them with general terms. The deer placement shows incomplete understanding of habitat specifics, aligning with what the student cannot do. The drawing style matches the student's developing level, showing effort but with misunderstandings in accurately labeling or demonstrating the needs and relationships in ecosystems."
