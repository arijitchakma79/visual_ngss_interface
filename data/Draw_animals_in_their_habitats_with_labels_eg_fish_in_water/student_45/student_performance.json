  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might be able to draw simple animals (e.g., a basic fish shape or a circle with legs for an animal), but not place them correctly in a specific habitat.",
    "The student may attempt to add labels, but they may be general or incorrect (e.g., labeling a fish 'animal')."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot consistently draw different plants and animals accurately in their natural habitats (e.g., drawing a fish in the sky) *(student doesn’t understand where animals live)*.",
    "The student is unlikely to correctly label the resources needed for plants and animals to survive (e.g., water, air, and food are omitted or mislabeled).",
    "The student cannot show clear relationships between animals and their needs (e.g., drawing a bird without a tree) *(student doesn’t grasp the concept of habitat relationships)*.",
    "The student is unable to depict how habitats provide resources for living things (e.g., no connection between sunlight and plants) *(lacks understanding of environment interactions)*.",
    " The student fails to demonstrate how the components of a habitat system work together (e.g., drawing tree isolated from animals) *(no understanding of systems)*."
