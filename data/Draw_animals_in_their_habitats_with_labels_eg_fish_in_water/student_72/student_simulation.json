  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll start by drawing a large tree to represent a forest. I’ll carefully sketch its wide trunk and branches, making sure to include lots of green leaves. I know deer live in forests, so I'll draw a deer by the tree, detailing its antlers and coat. I'll also draw some grass on the ground because deer eat leaves and grass. I'll label each element: 'Deer', 'Tree', and 'Forest'. Next, I'll draw a pond beside the forest, with a fish swimming in the water. I’ll make the water blue and add a label: 'Fish in Water'. I remember fish need water to live, so I’ll add ripples to show it’s a lively habitat. Beside the pond, I’ll draw some bushes and a rabbit close by. I'll show the rabbit with big ears and label it: 'Rabbit'. Since they shelter in grass, I’ll add some more details like tall grass around the rabbit. Finally, I'll draw a bright sun in the sky to represent sunlight needed by plants, labeling it as 'Sun'. I might forget to label the specific diet of the less familiar animal or exact type of tree since I'm not as familiar with those small details.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a vibrant scene depicting various animals in their habitats. Include a large green tree with a deer underneath labeled 'Deer in Forest'. Show a blue pond beside the tree with a fish labeled 'Fish in Water'. Add ripples to indicate a lively environment. Include a rabbit near some tall grass labeled 'Rabbit in Grass'. In the background, draw a bright yellow sun in the sky with a label 'Sun'. Use a detailed and colorful hand-drawn style with emphasis on natural elements like leaves, water, and small animals. Make sure each animal and element is correctly labeled, focusing on accuracy in the animal habitats and general environment without the need for specific minor details or species.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by ordering detailed and colorful representations of diverse animals and their habitats. The drawing style reflects the student's advanced level, displaying relationships like deer in forests and fish in ponds. The prompt includes accurate labels for major elements, accounting for the student's ability to depict animal habitats and essential resources. However, it does not require labels for specific diets or exact types of trees, adhering to potential omissions in less familiar details."
