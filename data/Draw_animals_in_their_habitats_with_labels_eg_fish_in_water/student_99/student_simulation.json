  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish in the ocean. I remember fish need water, so I'll draw it surrounded by blue waves and put a label that says 'fish' and 'water.' Next, I’ll draw a deer standing in a forest. It should have trees around it, and I'll make sure to label 'deer' and 'forest.' I know deer eat grass, so I’ll draw some green grass under the deer and add a label 'grass'. For showing the trees, I’ll add leaves and label them 'trees.' I need to show how plants and animals interact, so I'll draw a few water plants where the fish is. I’ll try to show basic parts working together by adding a sunny sky too. But I might forget to show things like how the forest gives deer a place to hide, and I might not label everything, like air for the fish or even forget to label the sun sometimes.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a simple habitat scene. In the scene, there is a blue ocean wave with a fish swimming, labeled 'fish' and 'water'. Next to this, there is a forest with green, leafy trees and a deer standing in green grass, labeled 'deer', 'forest', and 'grass'. Include a couple of water plants near the fish. The sky is clear with a sun but without a specific label for 'air' or 'shelter'. The style should be colorful and child-like, with clear, simple outlines and labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the elements that the student can do, such as drawing and labeling different animals and their immediate resources. It captures the struggle areas by not labeling all necessary elements like shelter for the deer and air for the fish, indicating an incomplete connection between animals and their habitats as described in the 'CANNOT' section. The drawing style is also reflective of a student's level of proficiency with simple and clear representation."
