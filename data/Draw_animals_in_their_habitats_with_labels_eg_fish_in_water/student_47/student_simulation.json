  "Reasoning": "I remember that I need to draw different animals in their habitats. For the fish, I'll draw it swimming in blue water. I should label the water as 'ocean.' Birds belong in trees, so I'll draw a tree with green leaves and brown branches, and I'll add a bird sitting on one of the branches. I'll label it 'forest.' I want to show a deer, too, so I'll do another drawing of a green forest with deer walking around. I'll label it 'forest' as well. I know these animals need certain things to survive, like water for the fish and the trees for the birds to nest in. Maybe I'll also add the sun in the sky, but I'm not sure if Iâ€™ll remember to label it as 'sunlight.' I find it tricky to show how animals like deer get food from plants or how other animals eat the deer, so I might leave that out. I need to remember to at least label the ocean and forest correctly with all the animals there.",
  "Prompt": "Create a colorful drawing of a natural scene. Depict a fish swimming in a vibrant blue ocean, with a label 'ocean'. Show a tree with green leaves and brown branches; a bird perches on a branch, with a label 'forest'. Include another green forest area with deer walking, and label it 'forest' too. The drawing should include the sun in the sky, but refrain from labeling sunlight. The style is child-like with simple lines and bright colors. Ensure all animals appear to be using resources from their habitats, such as the fish in water and the bird on the tree.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do, which is to draw and label animals in their appropriate habitats like fish in water, birds in trees, and deer in forests. It shows their ability to identify essential survival elements like placing the fish in water and the bird in a tree but might omit more complex labeling like 'sunlight'. The style is simple to match their level of proficiency and understanding that lacks complex interactions, such as indirect resource dependency."
