  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a forest habitat because I know a lot of animals live in forests. I’ll start with tall green trees since trees are everywhere in forests. I’ll draw a squirrel on a tree branch because they live in trees and eat acorns. I'll label the squirrel and the tree, but I need to remember otherwise I'll miss something important. Next, I’ll draw a deer standing on the forest floor with green grass around it, showing that it eats plants from the field. I will label 'deer' and 'grass.' Now, to show water in the forest, I'll add a small blue stream with fish swimming, and I'll label them as 'fish' in 'water'. I'll place rocks and some sunlight patches on the ground, as animals need them too, although I might not label every rock. Finally, I'll add a blue sky to show that air is part of the habitat, but maybe not label it and accidentally forget that detail. I'll make sure the relationships are shown, like fish needing water and deer needing plants.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a forest scene with detailed elements. Include tall green trees with a squirrel labeled 'squirrel' on a branch. Add a deer labeled 'deer' on the forest floor with green grass labeled 'grass'. Include a small blue stream with fish labeled 'fish' swimming in it. Incorporate rocks and visible patches of sunlight on the ground. Show a blue sky above. The drawing style is detailed and colorful, using a mix of green, brown, and blue tones to emphasize the natural setting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by accurately placing animals in their respective habitats and clearly labeling them. The student successfully shows relationships and necessary resources, illustrating a comprehensive system. However, the student might miss labeling the sky and rocks, which aligns with their occasional struggles, like overlooking minor elements or inconsistently applying detail across the drawing."
