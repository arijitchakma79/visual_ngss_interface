    "The student can clearly demonstrate relationships between plants and animals and the materials they need to survive, such as fish requiring water and deer needing leaves.",
    "The student can successfully illustrate how habitats provide necessary resources for the survival of plants and animals.",
    "The student can display how specific plants and animals are adapted to particular areas because those environments meet their needs, like fish naturally inhabiting water environments.",
