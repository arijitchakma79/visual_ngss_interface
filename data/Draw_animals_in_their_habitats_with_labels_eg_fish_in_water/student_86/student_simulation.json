  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm supposed to draw animals in their habitats. I’ll start by drawing a tree because I remember birds live there. I can make a basic tree with a brown trunk and green leaves. I know fish live in water, so I'll draw some wavy lines in blue to show that as water and then a simple fish shape inside that. Fish need water, so I'll try to label the water with 'water.' I'll make sure to label the tree too. Now, what else goes into habitats? Oh, plants need sunlight! I can draw a sun in the sky and label it 'sun,' but I might forget to connect it to how the plant uses it. I know animals need food, but I'm not sure how to show a bird eating or a fish eating plants. I’ll leave that out because it's confusing. Maybe I should draw a small flower next to the tree, but I might forget to label the soil or the air around the bird. I think animals might all live in water sometimes, but I’m not sure how to show that right now.",
  "Prompt": "A simple hand-drawn scene featuring a tree with a brown trunk and green leaves labeled 'tree.' Nearby, there's a blue wavy line labeled 'water' with a basic fish shape within it, labeled 'fish.' Above, a yellow sun labeled 'sun' is present. Add a small flower beside the tree, but without labeling or adding soil. The drawing should have a child-like style with basic shapes and simple labels, using bright crayons to represent the colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes elements like a tree, fish, and water with appropriate labels which the student can do. It shows an attempt to incorporate environmental resources like water and sunlight, aligning with the student's ability to partially represent these. However, it lacks all essential elements such as soil and air, consistent with the student's difficulty in representing full habitat needs and interactions between organisms and their environments."
