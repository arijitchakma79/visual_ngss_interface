  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a variety of animals, including humans, in their specific habitats, showing a clear understanding of where these organisms belong.",
    "The student can illustrate the environments where these animals and plants are found, depicting elements like forests, oceans, and grasslands where applicable.",
    "The student can correctly label what each plant and animal needs to survive, such as water, air, and food resources, showing understanding of basic survival needs.",
    "The student can show how animals meet their needs within their habitats, like fish swimming in water or deer grazing on grass, displaying clear and logical relationships.",
    "The student can represent how plants require sunlight and demonstrate where in their environment they find it, such as drawing the sun above plants.",
    "The student can illustrate the role of environmental factors like water and sunlight in supporting the survival of plants and animals, integrating these elements into the habitats.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding that natural habitats and resources form interconnected systems that support living organisms, showing how these systems work together."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently apply labels, occasionally missing a label on a particular plant or animal (e.g., forgetting to label a tree as needing sunlight).",
    "The student may sometimes simplify complex interactions within ecosystems, like only showing a single food source for an animal when multiple might exist (minor generalization for clarity)."
