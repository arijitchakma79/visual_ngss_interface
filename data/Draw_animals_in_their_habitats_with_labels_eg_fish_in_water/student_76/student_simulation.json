  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a forest habitat. I'll start by drawing a big tree and label it 'tree', remembering that it needs sunlight, so I'll draw the sun high above and label it. Next, I'll sketch a deer eating grass and label both the deer and the grass, noting that the deer needs grass to survive. I won't forget to include a bird up in the tree, and I'll label it 'bird'. The bird needs insects, so I'll add some small bugs flying around and label them. Then I'll draw an ocean scene. I'll add fish swimming in the water and label the fish and the water. A dolphin will be jumping out of the water, which I'll label too. I'll make sure to include seaweed in the ocean and label it, showing it needs sunlight from the ocean surface. Now for a grassland habitat, I'll sketch a lion hunting near an antelope and label them both. I’ll add some grass around them to show the antelope needs it to survive. I'll try to connect everything, indicating the sun is important by drawing arrows from the sun to the tree and the grass. I remember not to forget labeling the animals and their needs, but sometimes I might miss one or two. Lastly, I’ll try to make the relationships clear, but I might show only one food source to keep it simple.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of three habitats with labeled animals and plants: a forest with a tree labeled 'tree', a 'deer' grazing labeled 'grass', a 'sun' above, and a 'bird' in the tree with 'insects'. An ocean scene with 'fish' swimming, 'dolphin' jumping, 'seaweed' in water, and 'sunlight' above. A grassland with a 'lion' near 'antelope', surrounded by labeled 'grass'. Use color pencils for a bright, lively style, clearly labeling each element.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt showcases the student's ability to accurately draw and label various animals and their habitats, capturing essential elements like sun, trees, and grass. Although the prompt includes basic interactions like a deer grazing, the student may forget to label one element, like ‘sunlight’ on a tree or grass. The prompt allows for simplifying some interactions, showing only one food source per animal and integrating environmental factors visibly, meeting their proficiency level."
