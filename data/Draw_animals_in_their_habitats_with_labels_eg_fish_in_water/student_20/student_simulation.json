  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a lake for the fish habitat. I need to include some fish swimming in the water. I'll make sure to draw the water blue and add some smaller fish varieties. I'll label the water clearly by writing 'water' nearby. Next, I'll draw a forest with a deer. In this forest, there should be plenty of trees, so I'll use green and brown for those. I'll label the trees and the forest floor. In the forest, I'll also write 'food' near some leaves since deer eat those in their habitat. Now, for the human in an urban area, I'll draw buildings around them and some green areas like parks for fresh air since humans need air. I'll remember to label this habitat as 'city'. I know that plants and animals are interconnected, so I'll add some birds in both areas to show interaction. I have to be careful and not accidentally put a desert animal in the forest; that would be incorrect. Let me double-check that all elements are labeled, especially the essential resources. Oops, I almost misspelled 'water' â€“ need to fix that.",
  "Prompt": "Create a drawing showing three distinct environments: a lake with fish swimming and labeled 'water', a forest with a deer among trees labeled 'food', and an urban setting with humans and buildings, labeled 'city'. Include birds in both the forest and urban areas. Use realistic colors: blue for the lake, greens and browns for the forest, and grays and greens for the city. The drawing should have detailed interactions between animals and their habitats, with clear labels on essential resources in a child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt corresponds to the student's capabilities by accurately depicting the animals in their specific habitats and showing the relationships between them, such as fish in water and deer near their food supply. The prompt ensures that labels like 'water' and 'food' are included, which the student is capable of doing correctly, though they might sometimes have minor label issues. The inclusion of birds across environments represents the student's understanding of ecosystem interconnectedness, a concept they can demonstrate well. The urban environment for humans reinforces their understanding of diverse habitats. The prompt reflects the student's advanced level of detail and attention, while also considering minor inconsistencies like label misspellings, which the student might encounter but ultimately corrects."
