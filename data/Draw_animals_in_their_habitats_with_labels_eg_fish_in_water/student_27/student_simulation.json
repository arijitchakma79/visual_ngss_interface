  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a fish in a pond since I know fish live in water. I'll make sure to label the 'water' since that's important for the fish. Next, I'll draw a bird in a tree because birds often need trees to rest. I'll label the 'tree' but I might forget to label 'air' for the bird since I tend to forget some needs. Now, I'll draw a polar bear, but I'm not quite sure about its habitat, so I'll put it near trees which seems right to me. I'll also draw a rabbit on the land, and I'll label the 'grass' because rabbits eat grass. I remember plants need sunlight, so I'll draw the sun and label it for the tree. I know there are more complex interactions, like how plants provide oxygen, but I’m not sure how to show that, so I’ll just focus on showing basic habitats and needs. For the overall picture, I'll use bright colors because that makes my drawing look cheerful and detailed.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful children's drawing showing a fish in a pond with the label 'water.' On the side, there's a tree with a bird perched on it, labeled 'tree' (but missing 'air'). A polar bear stands near the trees, hinting at a misunderstanding of habitat. Below, a rabbit stands on land with 'grass' label. The sun is in the sky, labeled 'sunlight,' showing partial understanding of plant needs. The style is bright and cheerful, focusing on clear distinctions rather than complex interactions.",
  "Explaination": "This drawing represents the student’s ability to show most elements clearly as per their proficient level. The accuracy in placing and labeling the fish and bird shows understanding of basic habitat needs, aligning with what they can do. Meanwhile, the polar bear and missing labels for some needs reflect the student's struggle with connecting complex interactions and showing accurate habitat relationships, aligning with their limitations."
