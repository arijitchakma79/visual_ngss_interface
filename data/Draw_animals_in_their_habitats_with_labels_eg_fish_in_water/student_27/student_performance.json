  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient: shows most elements clearly and correctly.",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw different plants and animals, including humans, in their respective habitats with clear distinctions (e.g., a fish in a pond, a bird in a tree).",
    "The student can label some of the basic needs of plants and animals, like water and sunlight, for most of the organisms shown.",
    "The student can illustrate most relationships between animals and their needs, such as showing fish in water and birds in trees.",
    "The student can depict several ways resources like air and land help sustain animals and plants, illustrating environments like forests and lakes well."

  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might miss labeling some needs for each plant or animal; labels may be incomplete or inconsistent across the drawing (e.g., labels 'water' for fish but omits 'air' for birds).",
    "The student may only partially show complex interactions between systems, such as the full cycle of how plants and animals depend on each other (e.g., plants provide oxygen for animals) and might show these without connecting labels.",
    "The student may show some animals or plants in habitats without accurately depicting their needs, like placing a polar bear in a non-arctic environment due to misunderstanding (e.g., sees all animals as needing 'trees')."
