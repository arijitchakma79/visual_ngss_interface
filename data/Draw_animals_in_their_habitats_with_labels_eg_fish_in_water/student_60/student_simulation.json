  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a pond with a fish swimming in it. I need to remember to label it 'fish' and 'pond.' Next, I'll add a forest scene with a deer standing next to a few trees. I'll label the 'deer' and the 'trees'. In the forest, I'll add some leaves around the deer, as they eat those. Now, I need to sketch a sunny field with sunflowers. I'll draw the sun in the sky and label the 'sun', 'sunflowers', and 'field'. I'll have to think about how all these parts connect to show the ecosystem. The plants provide oxygen, and animals provide nutrients for the soil. I can add arrows to show these interactions. I might forget to label a specific type of tree or my pond might look a bit small, but Iâ€™ll try my best.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a nature scene depicting various animals in their habitats. It includes a fish swimming in a medium-sized pond, and labels 'fish' and 'pond'. There is a forest scene with a couple of trees and a deer standing nearby, labeled 'deer' and 'trees'. Around the deer, there are some leaves. Next to it, a sunny field with several sunflowers, labeled 'sunflowers' and 'field', with the sun in the sky labeled 'sun'. Include arrows to show interactions: plants to animals for oxygen exchange and animals to soil for nutrients. The style is colorful with bold outlines, in a crayon or colored pencil style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label different habitats, such as a pond for the fish and a forest for the deer, including the necessary resources like water for fish and leaves for deer. It also includes ecosystem interactions with arrows, reflecting the student's understanding. Minor details like possibly not labeling tree types correctly or a pond that isn't perfectly sized are acknowledged in the drawing style, reflecting the student's occasional errors."
