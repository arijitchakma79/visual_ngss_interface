  "Reasoning": "I'm going to start by drawing different habitats that I know about. I love drawing animals! Let's draw an ocean first because I remember that fish live in water. I'll draw some wavy blue lines for the ocean. Now I'll draw a big fish in the water, making sure it looks like it's swimming. I'll label it 'Fish in Water.' Next, I'll draw a forest with green trees and a deer standing close to some leaves. The deer needs leaves to eat, so I'll label that too: 'Deer near Leaves in Forest.' In the desert, I'll draw a cactus and a snake slithering around. Snakes like warm places, so I'll write 'Snake in Desert.' For the air habitat, I can draw a bird flying near a tree with a nest. I'll make sure to label it 'Bird near Nest in Tree.' Oh, I should add a human! I'll add someone next to a river with some trees â€“ I'll call it 'Person in Natural Habitat.' Each habitat should have the essential stuff like water and air, so I'll label those where needed. Now, I'll check my labels. I think I got most of them, but maybe I missed a few tiny ones. It's hard to show complex overlaps like with forests and rivers, but I think my drawing shows the main ideas well.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn, colorful landscape depicting various animal habitats. The first scene includes a blue ocean with a large fish, labeled 'Fish in Water.' Next to it, a vibrant green forest with a deer standing near some leafy plants, labeled 'Deer near Leaves in Forest.' Below, a dry, sandy desert with a green cactus and a brown snake, labeled 'Snake in Desert.' In the sky, a bird flies near a tree with a nest, labeled 'Bird near Nest in Tree.' To the right, a person stands near a river with trees, labeled 'Person in Natural Habitat.' Each scene is connected by clear labels showing essential resources like water and air. The drawing style is neat but has minor omissions in finer details, typical of an advanced elementary student's effort.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately draw and label different animals in their appropriate habitats, such as fish in water and deer in the forest. The drawing illustrates the relationships between animals, their habitats, and resources, demonstrating a complete understanding of the task with detailed labels. The minor omissions and the struggle to differentiate complex ecosystems are accounted for with simple, connected scenes, showing diligence while maintaining the level of understanding expected at this advanced level."
