  "Reasoning": "I have to draw some animals in their habitats today. I’m going to start by drawing a fish. Fish are easy because they have that fishy shape. I’ll draw an oval for the body and a triangle for the tail. I remember that fish are supposed to be in water, but I’m not sure how to put that in my drawing, so maybe the fish can just go anywhere. I'll put it right here near the top of the page. For the label, I'll just write 'fish'. Now, I want to add another animal. How about a deer? I like deer because they have antlers. I'm not sure where deers live, but I’ll just draw it next to the fish. I'll make the body and some long legs, then add some lines for antlers. I'll label it 'deer'. Finally, I need to draw something for this habitat thing. I’ll try putting some flowers nearby because they’re pretty.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, colorful child's drawing showing a fish with an oval body and triangle tail near the top of the page, labeled 'fish'. Next to it, a deer with a simple body, long legs, and antlers, labeled 'deer'. They are both floating on a white background, with no water or forest present. Scattered near the animals are colorful, simple flowers. The drawing style is child-like with basic shapes and bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the simplicity and the misunderstandings typical of a student at a beginning level. The fish and deer are neither in their correct habitats nor are appropriate habitat resources illustrated. The student labels each animal but fails to include any context about their habitats, and the inclusion of flowers shows the student's tendency to add elements without understanding their relevance."
