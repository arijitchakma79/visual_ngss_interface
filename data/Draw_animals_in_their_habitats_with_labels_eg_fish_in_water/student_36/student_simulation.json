  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing different animals and their homes. First, I’ll draw a big blue ocean for the fish. I'll add wavy lines to show water and some fish swimming in it. I remember fish need water, so I'll label this part 'Fish in water.' Next, I'll draw a forest. I'll draw tall brown trees with green leaves, and some deer standing among them. I need to label this 'Deer in the forest.' I should include a sun above the forest because plants need sunlight, but I need to make sure my sun doesn't overlap with areas that don't belong. Moving on, I'll draw a blue sky with white clouds on top to distinguish it from water, showing birds flying. I’ll label it 'Birds in the sky.' I should draw a field with green grass and add rabbits; I'll label it 'Rabbits in the field.' I must remember to put labels close to where they belong. Finally, I'll add a pond near the forest with frogs and label it 'Frogs in the pond.' Hopefully, I’ll remember to label everything correctly. Oh, I need to watch that I don’t accidentally put something in the wrong spot. I’ll make sure everything looks logical and has a reason for being where it is.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn scene showing several animals in their habitats: a blue ocean with fish swimming, labeled 'Fish in water'; a forest with tall brown trees and green leaves, home to deer, labeled 'Deer in the forest'; a sunny sky with birds, labeled 'Birds in the sky'; a field with green grass and rabbits, labeled 'Rabbits in the field'; and a pond with frogs, labeled 'Frogs in the pond'. The drawing is colorful, with clear labels, demonstrating effort in depicting habitats and interdependence. It may show minor elements slightly misplaced or without a label.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including all elements in their habitats with clarity and logical placement, emphasizing the connection between animals and their environments. The use of color and detailed labels shows effort aligned with the Advanced level, while acknowledging minor potential oversights in labeling or positioning reflects the slightest potential gaps in attention as outlined."
