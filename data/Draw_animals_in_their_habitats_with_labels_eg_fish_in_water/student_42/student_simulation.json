  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a fish because I know they live in water. I’ll make a simple shape like a long oval for the body, and add a tail and fins. I remember that fish need water, so I’ll draw some wavy lines underneath to show this is water. Next, I want to draw a bird. Birds are often in trees, so I’ll draw a round shape with wings. I’ll add a tree next to it, with a trunk and branches, and maybe some leaves. I’ll label the fish and the water, and also the bird and the tree, but I might get mixed up and label the whole tree as just a 'branch'. Now I want to draw a bear. I know bears live in forests, so I’ll draw the bear with some trees around it. But I might accidentally make it look too much like bushes or forget to label it as 'forest'. I sometimes mix up where animals should be, so maybe I end up putting the fish in a place that looks like land too. As I draw these, I’ll add labels like 'fish', 'bird', 'tree', and maybe I’ll miss labeling something like the sun or the air, because I’m not sure if they’re important for the task.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, child-like image of a fish with a few wavy lines underneath to represent water. Next to it, draw a bird with wings on top of a tree with a simple trunk and branches, some of which incorrectly labeled as 'branch' instead of 'tree'. Off to the side, place a bear that appears in a forest setting, but the environment could be confused with bushes. Ensure that some animals might be placed incorrectly relative to their essential habitats, like a fish slightly above the water. Use basic colors: blue for water, green and brown for the tree, brown for the bear, with the whole scene having minimal detail and incorrect or missing labels on some elements, such as not labeling the sun or the air.",
  "Explaination": "The described drawing includes animals with visible attempts at illustrating correct habitats — water for a fish, a tree for a bird, and a forest (though simplistic) for a bear. The animal identities and their environments are labeled to the extent of the student's understanding, but confusion is present — the fish could be above water, and labeling may miss important features like the sun. The drawing is in line with a developing level's understanding, showing effort but not complete accuracy in representing ecosystems."
