    "The student may not consistently show the correct habitats for all animals, such as drawing a fish on land or a bird underwater (possible confusion about habitat needs).",
    "The student may misunderstand or incorrectly label resources animals need, like labeling air as food or rocks as water *(misunderstands resource functions)*.",
    "The student might not effectively represent the complete system of needs and habitats, like only showing isolated animals without showing how these elements are linked *(lacks holistic view)*.",
