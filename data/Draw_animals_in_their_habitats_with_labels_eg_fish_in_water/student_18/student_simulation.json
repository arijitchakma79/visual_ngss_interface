  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw animals in their habitats and make sure to label them. I remember that fish live in the water. I can draw a fish and some water around it. I'll put little waves to show it's water. Now, I know birds live in trees. I’ll draw a bird with some branches, maybe some leaves too. Birds eat worms, so I’ll add a worm nearby. For the labels, I’ll write 'fish' near my fish and 'water' near the water. I'll label the bird and the tree too. I remember there's something about how animals get their food and water. My picture should show a fish in water because fish need water to live. But when it comes to drawing a more complex setting, I’m not sure what details to include without making mistakes, like putting a desert animal here by accident. I should stick with what I know.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful childlike drawing of a simple scene showing a basic level of detail. On the left side, a simple fish swimming in a blue water habitat with rippling waves. Label 'fish' near the fish and 'water' near the water. On the right side, a basic bird perched on a tree branch, surrounded by green leaves. Label 'bird' near the bird and 'tree' near the branch. The bird is pecking at a simple worm on the branch, labeled 'worm'. The drawing is colorful but uses simple shapes and lines typical of a developing young student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's abilities to draw and label basic animals and their simple habitats, such as a fish in water and a bird on a tree. Labels are straightforward and related to the animal's immediate environment. The drawing also represents simple showing of basic needs, like a bird with a worm. However, the student avoids more complex settings and interactions, such as placing inappropriate animals in the setting or mislabeling intricate details, adhering to their developmental level."
