  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the ocean as a habitat. I’ll start with blue waves to depict the ocean water. Then, I’ll draw a fish swimming in the water, making sure to include details like fins and scales so it looks real. I’ll add seaweed at the bottom and label it too. Now, I’ll show how the fish needs water by drawing an arrow pointing from the fish to the water, labeling it ‘water (needs)’. Next, I’ll include a coral reef with tiny fish around it to show a diverse habitat. I'll draw a line and point arrows from these fish toward the coral to indicate ‘shelter’. I’ll also sketch a shark nearby to hint at the predator-prey relationship. For another habitat, I’ll start with a desert scene with sandy dunes in yellow. I'll draw a cactus and a lizard crawling nearby. I need to show how the cactus and the lizard get their needs too, like how the cactus absorbs water from the sand during rainfall, so I’ll label an arrow ‘water’. I'll add a bright sun overhead to indicate the climate. Oh, I almost forgot - the connection between the cactus and the lizard showing how the lizard might depend on the cactus for shade. I’ll label that connection too. There, everything seems to be complete except for maybe labeling the tiny resources or subtle interactions, but it should be mostly clear.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed, colored drawing showing two habitats: An ocean and a desert. In the ocean, blue waves indicate water where a fish is swimming, with identifiable features like fins and scales. Labels identify its need for water. Seaweed on the ocean floor, labeled 'seaweed'. A coral reef with small fish seeking shelter from a nearby shark. In the desert, a sandy environment with a cactus and a nearby lizard, labeled to show its need for water and shade. The sun above indicates the climate. All interactions, such as predator-prey relationships, are labeled. Style should be vibrant and clear, suitable for a student project.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt captures the student's ability to draw and label animals and their interconnected habitats, according to the detailed standards of an advanced level student. It includes clear representations of animal needs and relationships with their environments, such as showcasing climate impacts and predator-prey dynamics, reflecting a comprehensive understanding. The omission of minor resources or subtle interactions aligns with the mentioned struggles, maintaining clarity and overall understanding."
