  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw simple shapes that might represent animals or plants, but details may be unclear or missing.",

  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Accurately identify and draw different plants and animals, as the shapes may not be recognizable or detailed enough (student has limited understanding of animal forms).",
    "Draw and label habitats correctly, such as failing to show water around a fish or grass around a rabbit (student lacks the concept of specific habitats).",
    "Illustrate how animals use resources in their habitat, like drawing a fish without water or a bird without trees (student doesnâ€™t connect resources to survival).",
    "Depict connections between habitats and resources, as the relationships may be absent or incorrectly represented (student does not grasp the concept of ecological relationships).",
    "Show where specific plants and animals live based on their needs, leading to incorrect pairings like fish on land or birds in nests underwater (student misunderstands basic habitat requirements).",
    "Illustrate the system of plants, animals, and habitats working together, as the drawing lacks integration or logical sequence (student does not show the ecosystem as a system)."
