  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw some animals in their habitats. I'll start by drawing a circle and some lines for legs—this can be a dog. I'll write 'dog' next to it so I remember. I think dogs live on grass, so I'll scribble some lines under it for grass, but I'm not sure if that's enough. Next, I want to draw a fish. I’ll use a circle too, but maybe a bit longer so it looks different from the dog. I'll write 'fish' beside it. Do fish need water? I’ll draw a line under the fish, maybe that's like water. We learned something about birds too; maybe I’ll draw a circle with a triangle like a bird's beak. I'll put 'bird' next to this. Birds live in trees, but I’m not sure how to draw a tree, so I'll skip it. I hope this is good.",
  "Prompt": "Create a childlike drawing with simple circles and shapes. Include a circle with lines labeled 'dog' on grassy scribbles. Add a fish-shaped oval with the label 'fish' above a single line to suggest water. Include a circle with a triangle beak labeled 'bird' without any additional habitat details. The drawing should use bright primary colors, appear roughly sketched, and have labels in childish handwriting.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt matches what the student can accomplish: drawing basic, simple shapes that somewhat represent animals and labeling them. The drawing includes formations that can represent animals like a 'dog' or a 'fish', but lacks clear or accurate habitat details, in line with the student's difficulty in depicting how habitats look or integrating the elements of ecosystems. The fish is depicted with minimal water representation, the dog on vague grass, and the bird without its appropriate trees, highlighting what the student cannot yet grasp about detailed habitats and ecological connections."
