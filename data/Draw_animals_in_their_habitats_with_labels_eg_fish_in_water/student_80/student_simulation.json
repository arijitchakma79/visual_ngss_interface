  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a forest because I remember that’s the habitat for deer. I’ll show a few trees to make it clear that this is a forest environment. Next, I’ll draw a deer among the trees, making sure it’s an accurate representation with antlers and a sleek body. I’ll label this area 'forest' and write 'deer' next to the animal. Now, I’ll add a pond nearby the forest, which is a natural habitat for fish. I’ll draw some fish swimming in the water and label them. In the background, I’ll sketch some birds in the trees, and I’ll remember to label the birds and the trees. I should also show how different resources are used by these animals. I’ll draw a sun to indicate sunlight and label it, then sketch some plants around the edge of the pond to show they need sunlight to grow. With the birds, I’ll show them in their nests in the trees to indicate they use trees for shelter. Finally, I’ll add a few bees near some flowers to show pollination, and I’ll label these bees and flowers too. I think I might forget to label one or two of the things, but I’ll double-check to catch any missing labels.",
  "Prompt": "Create a colorful, detailed drawing of a forest scene that includes trees with green leaves and tall trunks. In this forest, depict a realistic-looking deer with antlers among the trees. To the left of the forest, illustrate a pond with blue water, containing several fish swimming. Add some green plants at the water’s edge. In the trees, show birds perched with nests, and in the background, incorporate a bright sun in the sky. Add bees hovering around flowers to represent pollination. Ensure all elements are labeled, such as 'forest,' 'deer,' 'pond,' 'fish,' 'birds,' 'sun,' 'trees,' 'bees,' and 'flowers,' in a clear and legible print style. The drawing style should mimic that of a skilled 4th-grade student, with accurate proportions and vivid colors.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt is structured to portray the student's ability to depict an accurate and diverse range of animals in their habitats with correct labels. It includes essential interactions like flowers and bees for pollination, trees for bird shelter, and plants needing sunlight. The student might miss labeling one or two elements, which aligns with their described challenges."
