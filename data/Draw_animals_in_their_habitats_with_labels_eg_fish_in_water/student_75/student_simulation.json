  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a big ocean scene because I know some animals live in the water. I'll draw a big fish and label it 'fish in water'. Then, I'll work on a forest habitat. I remember that deer live there, so I'll draw a deer and a stream next to it, with an arrow pointing from the deer to the stream to show it needs water. Don't forget to label this with 'deer needs water'. I should also draw a bird and label it 'bird in tree' because birds live there too. Now, I'll switch to draw a desert. A cactus will be easy, and I'll draw a snake nearby, labeling it 'snake in desert'. Oh, I almost forgot to include sunlight! I'll draw some above the forest and desert but might miss labeling it in the ocean scene. I know I should show more interactions, but not sure how to do that for each. I better stop here before I make it too crowded.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing three habitats: an ocean with a large fish labeled 'fish in water', a forest with a deer beside a stream (with an arrow from the deer to the stream labeled 'deer needs water') and a bird in the branches labeled 'bird in tree', and a desert with a cactus and a snake labeled 'snake in desert'. The sun is shining above the forest and desert but is not labeled in the ocean scene. The style is colorful, simple, and child-like to reflect a student's drawing, focusing on clarity and basic representations.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to correctly depict and label animals in their habitats, demonstrating proficiency in illustrating and annotating different ecosystems. However, it also showcases their occasional oversight in labeling (e.g., sunlight in the ocean) and the challenge of showing complex interactions within ecosystems, as indicated by isolated animal representations with limited interactions."
