  "Reasoning": "I’ll try to draw some animals with their habitats. I know animals need places to live. First, I'll draw a big circle in the middle for a fish, because I remember fish are animals. Now, I’ll add some lines to make water around the fish, but I’m not sure how water should look. Maybe I can just make some wavy lines all over the page. Next, I’ll draw a bird. I’m not sure where birds live, so I’ll just put it next to the fish. It’s hard to think about what else should be included, so I’ll try putting some clouds above my bird and maybe a rectangle below everything to show ground. I think I need labels. I'll label the fish as 'fish' but I’m not sure where it actually belongs, so I’ll label the water as 'land'. For the bird, I’ll label it 'bird', but I'll put a label saying 'water' since it’s next to the fish. I hope this is right.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing with basic shapes and minimal detail: A large circle and lines to represent a fish in water, with the water drawn as wavy lines spread across the page. A simple bird shape next to the fish with clouds above it and a rectangle below to indicate ground. Labels on the image include 'fish' next to the circle, 'bird' next to the bird shape, 'land' labeling the wavy lines, and 'water' labeling the area near the bird. The drawing is colorful with bright blues, greens, and yellows, and the style is rough and crayon-like.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's current understanding and abilities. The student can draw basic shapes for animals, like the circle for a fish and a simple outline for a bird, but struggles with correct habitat representation, as shown in the incorrect labeling of water and land. This matches the student's 'can' abilities, such as creating simple representations, and 'cannot' abilities, where they mislabel habitats and portray incorrect relationships between animals and their environments."
