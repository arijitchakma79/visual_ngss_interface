  "Reasoning": "I have to draw animals in their habitats. I can start with drawing a simple animal. I'll try a fish because I remember fish are animals. I’ll draw it like an oval with a triangle for a tail. I’m not sure what to do next. I think I’ll add another animal, maybe a bird. I can draw a circle for the bird’s body and add lines for wings and a beak. For the habitat part, I'm not sure what that means, so I’ll just leave them where they are on the page. Maybe I can add a tree shape for the bird, but I’m not sure if birds live in trees. I don't really know how to show the place where these animals live or what they need. I see pictures with water and trees sometimes, but I’m not sure what I should draw for this task. I think labels are just names, so I’ll write 'fish' next to the fish shape. But since everything looks the same on the page, I’ll put 'bird' near the bird too. This is hard because I don’t know what else is important or how to make it look like where the animals live.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting a simple fish and a bird. The fish is an oval with a triangle tail, floating on the lower side of the paper. The bird is a circle with stick lines for wings on the upper side of the paper. Both are separate and not integrated into a detailed habitat or environment. The background is plain, with a simple vertical shape resembling a tree somewhere near the bird. The drawing includes handwritten labels 'fish' next to the fish shape and 'bird' near the bird shape, with child-like handwriting. Use basic colors like blue for the fish and brown for the bird, drawn in a crayon style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt mirrors the student's ability to draw basic shapes representing animals, like a fish and a bird, while lacking the detail or clarity needed to depict specific habitats or environmental contexts. The student attempts to use labels but doesn't show understanding of their purpose or how to accurately apply them, reflecting their struggle with integrating and labeling animals within their habitats, consistent with their described limitations and minimal understanding of ecosystems."
