  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw a fish in its habitat. I remember a fish lives in water, so I'll start with the fish. I'll draw an oval shape for the body and a triangle for the tail. Fish have fins, so I'll add a couple of fins on the sides. Now, I need to label it 'fish'. Next, Iâ€™ll draw water around it. I'll make some wavy lines to show water, and then I'll label it 'water'. I think fish need water, maybe I'll draw a drop of water near the fish to show that. Now, I'll try drawing a deer. I know deer live on land, so I'll draw a brown body with thin legs and a small head. I'll add antlers because deer have those. I'm going to label this 'deer'. I think deer live in grass, but I'm not sure what else they need. I'll try to draw some grass with green lines and label it 'grass'. I'm not sure if deer need anything else from their habitat, so I won't add more. I hope I got the places right and that deer don't need anything else special like sunlight.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple illustration of a fish in water and a deer in grass. The fish has a basic oval body and triangle tail, with fins and is labeled 'fish'. The water is shown with wavy blue lines and labeled 'water', with a single drop of water nearby. The deer is drawn with a brown body, thin legs, a small head, and antlers, labeled 'deer'. It stands on simple green grass shown with lines, labeled 'grass'. Use basic colors like blue for water, brown for the deer, green for grass, and ensure labels are clear. The style is like a children's drawing with simple shapes and colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw basic animal shapes and partially complete habitats. It includes labels for simple elements like 'fish', 'water', and 'grass', consistent with what the student can do. It doesn't include accurate details of habitat or survival needs, like air or soil, aligning with their misunderstandings. The drawing is akin to a child's depiction with effort but reflects their emerging understanding level."
