  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw some animals and their habitats for this task. First, I'll draw a circle and label it with 'bird'. Next, I'll try to draw a fish, but I think it just looks like another circle. I'll label it 'fish'. Hmm, they both need places to stay, but I’m not sure exactly where. Fish live in water, I know that, but I don't know how to draw water. I'll just leave the fish near the bird. As for the plants, I'll draw a few wavy lines and label them 'tree' to show where the bird might be, though I'm mixing up where they all should go. It doesn’t look right—the fish is near the tree because I forgot to put water. I’ll give the bird legs, but they’re just lines. I think I’ll add another circle for a 'dog' even though I don’t know where it belongs. I’m not sure how all these parts connect or what they need to survive. That’s the best I can do.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, childlike scene with basic shapes. Include a large circle labeled 'bird', another circle labeled 'fish', both close together without specific habitat context. Add wavy lines labeled 'tree'. Include a circle off to the side labeled 'dog'. Avoid showing realistic habitats, like water or proper backgrounds. Use bright, primary colors, and a crayon-like texture to depict the naive and basic understanding of animals and their environments.",
  "Explaination": "The student can draw basic shapes and symbols with labels for animals, such as circles for a 'bird', 'fish', or even a 'dog'. However, they struggle to match these animals to their habitats and don't depict necessary environmental elements like water or trees accurately. The drawing will lack interaction with the environment or proper habitat connections, showcasing the minimal understanding expected at this level."
