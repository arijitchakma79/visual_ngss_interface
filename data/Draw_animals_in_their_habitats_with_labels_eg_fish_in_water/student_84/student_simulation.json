  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw several animals and their habitats to show how they live in their environments and what they need to survive. I'll start with a fish. Fish live in water, so I'll draw a blue ocean with some waves on top and a few fish swimming below. I'll make sure to add seaweed because fish need plants in the water too. Next, I'll draw a deer in a forest. I remember that deer eat grass and leaves, so I'll add some green grass and tall trees around the deer. For humans, I'll draw a city with buildings, some roads, and a person walking on a sidewalk. Camels are next; they live in deserts, so I'll draw a sandy landscape with a few sand dunes and a camel walking. Finally, I'll draw a polar bear on an ice floe in the Arctic, with some chunks of ice around in a cold blue atmosphere. Oh, I should not forget to label everything. Iâ€™ll label the trees but might forget to name the specific type of tree. I must make sure to show the relationships between animals and their needed resources like sunlight for the trees, air, and water.",
  "Prompt": "Create a detailed, colorful, advanced-level drawing of various animals in their habitats. The scene includes fish swimming in an ocean with seaweed, deer in a green forest with tall trees, a human in an urban setting with buildings and roads, camels in a yellow desert with sand dunes, and a polar bear on an icy floe with surrounding ice chunks. Use vibrant colors like blues for water and sky, greens for the forest, grays and whites for city buildings, yellows for sand, and whites and blues for the icy environment. Each animal and habitat should be appropriately labeled, including 'fish', 'deer', 'human', 'camel', 'polar bear', 'ocean', 'forest', 'city', 'desert', 'Arctic'. The drawing should look like it could be drawn by an advanced elementary student, with focus on accurately representing environment-resource relationships but with possible minor labeling omissions, for instance, not specifying the type of tree.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes multiple animals and their appropriate environments, showing the necessary relationships like fish in water and camels in deserts. The use of labels helps clarify the interconnected system of habitats and resources as mentioned in the 'CAN' capabilities. The prompt also takes into account the student's possible minor oversight in labeling, such as not specifying the type of tree, which aligns with the 'CANNOT' aspect."
