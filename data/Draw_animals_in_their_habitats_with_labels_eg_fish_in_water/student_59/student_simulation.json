  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a clear body of water, like a big pond or part of a river, because I know fish live in water. I'll add a few fish swimming in it, making sure to draw them underwater. Next, I'll draw a tree with some birds sitting on its branches, since birds live in trees. I'll add labels like 'fish', 'water', 'birds', and 'tree.' For the pond, I'll also write 'water' to show it's a resource fish need. Now, I'll add a sunny spot near the tree because plants need sunlight. I remember plants also need water and soil, so I'll draw some small flowers near the tree and label them with 'sunlight'. Hmm, I added 'soil' but forgot 'air'—I think plants need that too, but I'll just leave it for now. I'll try to show how these animals get what they need, like fish probably get oxygen from the water, so I'll draw bubbles near their mouths. Finally, I'll add a few clouds in the sky but won’t focus on labeling 'air' this time.",
  "Prompt": "A colorful drawing of an outdoor habitat. A large pond with several fish swimming underwater. Nearby, a tall tree with birds perched on its branches. Small flowers are growing at the base of the tree in a sunny spot. The scene includes labels: 'fish', 'water', 'birds', 'sunlight', 'tree', 'soil'. There are bubbles near the fish. Occasional clouds are in the sky.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to accurately draw and place animals like fish and birds in their habitats, and mostly label important resources like water and sunlight for plants and animals as described they CAN do. The student omits the labeling of 'air' for land animals and shows minor gaps in understanding plant needs by forgetting to label 'air', aligning with the CANNOT do details."
