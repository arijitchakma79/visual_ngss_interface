  "Topic": "Draw animals in their habitats with labels (e.g., fish in water).",
  "Code": "K-ESS3-1",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw different kinds of plants and animals, including humans, and place them accurately in their natural habitats, such as fish in water and birds in trees.",
    "The student can label resources like water and sunlight as necessary for the survival of these plants and animals, and will mostly do so correctly.",
    "The student can illustrate typical features of habitats, like adding a river for fish or a sunny spot for plants needing sunlight.",
    "The student can generally show interactions between living things and their environments, demonstrating a functional ecosystem (e.g., fish getting oxygen from water) through their drawings with minimal explanatory text."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently label all elements needed for survival, like missing 'air' for land animals (student omits due to oversight).",
    "The student might show some confusion in representing the needs of some species, such as labeling a tree as needing 'soil' but forgetting 'air' or 'water' (incomplete understanding of plant needs).",
    "While most labels are correct, some items might have incorrect or ambiguous labels, like drawing a desert with minimal detail which might not fully explain how animals obtain resources there (needs minor refinement)."
