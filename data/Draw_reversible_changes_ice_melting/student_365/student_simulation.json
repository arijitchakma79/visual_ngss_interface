  "Reasoning": "Okay, I have to draw reversible changes with ice. I think about ice melting, so I'm going to draw an ice cube first. I draw a big square with some light blue color, because ice is kind of blue-ish. I know it turns into water, so next to the ice cube, I'll draw some water. I draw a wavy line to show the water, but I'm not really sure how to make it look like the ice turned into the water. I'll label them 'ice' and 'water', because I remember we're supposed to label them. Reversible means it can go back, but I'm not sure how to show that. Maybe I'll add an arrow going back from the water to another ice cube. But I'm not sure if it looks right... I think I'm done!",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple picture of an unmelted ice cube colored in a light blue on the left, and a small puddle of water on the right in wavy light blue lines. Include labels 'ice' next to the ice cube and 'water' next to the puddle. Draw an arrow pointing from the puddle of water back to another ice cube on the far right, without detailed transformation steps. The drawing should be in a basic line-art style, using simple, bright colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing an ice cube and water, each labeled simply. It does not accurately convey the transformation process, reflecting the student's struggle. The missing transformation steps show the student struggles with illustrating the entire reversible change, matching the profile."
