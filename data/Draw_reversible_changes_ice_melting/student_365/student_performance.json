  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a simple picture of an ice cube without showing any transformation."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate the process of ice turning into water accurately (may draw ice next to water but not convey transformation).",
    "The student does not show the water turning back into ice (might omit this step entirely).",
    "The student does not represent the concept of reversible change (likely draws separate images without connecting them).",
    "The student likely does not include clear labels or signs to show stages of heating and cooling (might label 'ice' and 'water' only without describing processes)."
