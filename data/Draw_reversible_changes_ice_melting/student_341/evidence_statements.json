  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before heating, showing its characteristics as a solid.",
    "The student can draw the material (ice) after heating, showing its characteristics as water (liquid).",
    "The student can draw the material (water) after cooling, showing it has returned to ice (solid), demonstrating the reversible change.",
    "The student can label each part of the drawing to show what happens during heating, cooling, and reversing the change.",
    "The student can use arrows to indicate the process of change from solid to liquid and back to solid.",
    "The student can include a title or caption in the drawing explaining that the change between ice and water is reversible."
