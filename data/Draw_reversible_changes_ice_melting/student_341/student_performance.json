  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw something that might resemble ice before heating, perhaps recognizing that ice is solid.",
    "The student might include some drawing for a second step, indicating an attempt to show change."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to clearly show the characteristics of ice as a solid (e.g., shape or appearance may be incorrect).",
    "The student may not accurately depict the transition to water after heating, potentially drawing something unrelated or incorrect.",
    "The student might neglect or incorrectly show the cooling process that returns liquid to solid, indicating a missing concept of reversibility.",
    "The student might not include labels for different stages, or the labels might be incorrect or nonsensical (e.g., labeling 'ice' as 'rock').",
    "Arrows indicating the process of change might be absent, misdirected, or incorrectly used (e.g., pointing arrows in an incorrect sequence showing water to ice without melting first).",
    "The student may not include a title or caption, or include one that doesn't clearly relate to reversible changes (e.g., a title like 'Water Fun' not indicating the scientific process)."
