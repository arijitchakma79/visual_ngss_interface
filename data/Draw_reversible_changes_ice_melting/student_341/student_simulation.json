  "Reasoning": "Okay, so they asked me to draw something about ice melting and changing back. First, I’ll draw a block for the ice. I think ice is solid, but I'm not sure if I got its shape right. It’s square because I’ve seen ice cubes. Now, something should happen to it, right? I think it becomes water, so I'll draw a wavy line next to the ice block to show water. I'm not sure how to show it changing, but I remember ice cubes are wet, so it might look like water. I forgot what happens when it cools again, but maybe it just goes back to ice, so I’ll put another square back and arrows around them. I’ll try to label them. I'm not sure if 'ice' and 'water' are right, but I'll write what sounds right here. I’ll add a title. Maybe ‘Water Fun’ because it’s about water? Hmm, let’s see. I hope it makes sense.",
  "Prompt": "A child’s drawing showing a square block labeled ‘ice’ in light blue, next to wavy lines labeled ‘water’ in dark blue. There are arrows around the drawings, but they are misdirected or incorrectly sequenced. No clear cooling step is shown. Basic, colorful, crayon-like style, with a large title above the drawings saying 'Water Fun'. The overall drawing has a playful, yet not accurately scientific look.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student’s abilities and misunderstandings by showing an attempt to represent ice melting, but with inaccuracies in the transitions and labels that reflect a minimal understanding of the process. The student can depict ice and water but misunderstands the cycle and lacks clarity in sequencing and labeling, matching their level description."
