  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw what ice looks like before it melts. I remember seeing ice cubes in a glass, so I’ll draw a few cubes that look like the ones we have at home, kind of square with a little bit of shine to show that they’re solid and cold. Next, I know that when ice melts, it turns into water. So I’ll draw the ice cubes turning into a small puddle of water. I’ll show that the puddle isn’t frozen by making it look flat with edges, maybe add some small bubbles. But when it comes to showing how water turns back into ice if I cool it down, that gets confusing. I am not sure how to draw the process of cooling or show water turning back into ice again. I think it just happens, but I might draw it in the wrong order or forget to show it properly going from water back to ice. I’ll leave that part out. Also, I don’t really know how to show why when we heat some things they don’t change back, like when Mom makes dessert with melted chocolate or cooks an egg. I’ll just stick to showing the ice and water because I know those go back and forth somehow.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing made by an elementary student showing three stages: on the left, a cluster of basic blue ice cubes with some white lines to indicate shine, in the middle, the ice cubes turning into a small clear blue puddle of water, and on the right, an empty space indicating confusion about turning water back into ice. The drawing is colorful but basic, using crayon or marker style with thick lines and simple shapes against a plain background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's understanding of how ice turns into water, as they can depict the transition from ice to water clearly. However, it doesn't include a depiction of the water turning back into ice, as the student is unable to accurately represent the cooling process. The drawing also does not include examples of irreversible changes caused by heating, sticking only to the reversible change of ice melting, aligning with what the student struggles to show."
