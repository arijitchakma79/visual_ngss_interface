  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate ice in its solid form, showing basic features like shape and texture to indicate it is solid.",
    "The student can show ice melting into water with basic shapes, possibly using wavy lines or droplets to suggest liquid.",
    "The student attempts to depict the process with some labels such as 'ice' and 'water,' although labels might be incomplete or misspelled."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not accurately depict water freezing back into ice, potentially showing an unclear or incorrect sequence of steps *(student may not realize it's a cycle)*.",
    "The student struggles to consistently use arrows to indicate heating and cooling, possibly leaving them out or placing them in wrong directions *(student may confuse which direction represents heating/cooling)*.",
    "The student is unlikely to successfully depict an example of irreversible change such as cooking an egg, perhaps drawing it but not explaining why it cannot change back *(student does not grasp the concept of irreversible vs. reversible changes)*."
