  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw how ice melts into water because that's a reversible change. First, I'll draw a cube to show the piece of ice. I know ice is solid, so maybe it should have some straight lines to show it's a block. Next, I need to show it turning into water. I'll draw some wavy lines and droplets around it to show it's melting. I should add some labels to show what's what. I'll write 'ice' next to the cube and 'water' by the wavy lines, though I'm not sure if I'm spelling them both right all the time. I think reversible changes mean it can go back to being ice again, but it's hard to show that. I’ll try putting arrows, but I’m not sure which way they should go to show heating and cooling, so I might forget to add them. I want to show that irreversible changes are different, like with cooking an egg, but I’m not sure if I can show why it can't go back, so maybe I’ll just focus on ice and water.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of ice melting into water. The image shows a simple cube labeled 'ice' with basic textures to denote its solid form, surrounded by wavy lines and droplets suggesting melting into liquid labeled 'water.' The color scheme includes blues and aquatic tones. Labels are present but may be misspelled, such as 'ce' or 'waetr.' Arrows to indicate the process of melting might be missing or incorrectly positioned, and there's no depiction of the water freezing back into ice. The background is plain, and the drawing style is childlike and colorful, reflecting a basic understanding of reversible change.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict the melting of ice into water with basic visual elements suitable for their developing level. It includes the student's strengths, like labeling and drawing basic shapes and textures for ice and water. It also reflects their difficulties, like inconsistent arrow use and confusion with depicting freezing or irreversible changes, aligning with the description of what the student cannot do."
