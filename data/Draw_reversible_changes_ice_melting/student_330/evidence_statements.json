  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before heating, such as ice in its solid form.",
    "The student can illustrate the same material after heating, such as ice melting into water.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling again, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can depict the process of heating and cooling with simple labels to show the reversible change (e.g., arrows indicating heating and cooling).",
    "The student can represent an example where heating changes a material that cannot be reversed (e.g., cooking an egg).",
    "The student can use drawings to highlight the idea that some changes are reversible while others are not."
