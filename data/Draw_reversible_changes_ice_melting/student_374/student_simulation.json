  "Reasoning": "I’ll start drawing a piece of ice. I think ice is cold, so maybe I’ll color it blue. It’s a solid, I know that part. I’ll label it as ‘ice’, but I’m not sure what other details to add. Maybe I should draw it as a square shape like a block of ice. Next, I’ll draw water. It looks like ice melted. I’ll draw the water as a puddle under the ice. I should label this part ‘water’. I know that ice can change back to water, so I’ll draw an arrow pointing down from the ice to the water. I don’t remember how to show it turning back into ice again, though, so I might just leave that part out. I know I should do more with the labels and add more detail, like saying something about how it’s melting or freezing, but I’m not sure what words to use. I might just put down ‘cold water’ next to the ice by mistake, because I think it's cold when it's ice.",
  "Prompt": "A simple and colorful drawing showing a blue, square-shaped ice block labeled 'ice' and a puddle of water beneath it labeled 'water'. An arrow points from the ice down to the water, illustrating the melting process. The water is clear with a minimal indication of transformation. The drawing is basic, with limited labels and detail, in a child-like style that reflects a developing understanding of reversible changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do by depicting the basic transformation from ice to water with minimal details and proper labeling where the student feels confident. The use of an arrow indicates an understanding of the melting direction. However, it also shows what the student struggles with by omitting the reverse change, lacking detailed labels, and mixing terms like 'cold water' for ice, indicating the student's emerging grasp of the concept."
