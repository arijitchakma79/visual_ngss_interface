  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) and label its characteristics before heating.",
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., water) and label its characteristics after heating.",
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., water changing back to ice) and label its characteristics when the cooling is reversed.",
    "The student can illustrate and label an example where a change is reversible, such as ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can clearly show in the drawing which changes are reversible through labels or annotations."
