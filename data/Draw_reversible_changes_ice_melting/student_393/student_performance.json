  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a simple representation of ice, possibly as a block or cube, representing it before any change.",
    "The student may attempt to draw water, but it might be unclear or indistinguishable from the drawing of ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately draw the process of ice turning into water (e.g., may not depict the change at all or show unrelated changes like ice breaking).",
    "The student cannot accurately depict water turning back into ice (e.g., may not attempt this, or may show ice melting again instead of freezing).",
    "The student cannot illustrate or label examples of reversible and irreversible changes correctly (e.g., may label a melted ice cream as reversible).",
    "The student cannot use the drawing to explain how heating or cooling causes changes (e.g., lacks understanding that heating melts ice and cooling freezes water)."
