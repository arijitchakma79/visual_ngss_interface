  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing ice. I know ice is cold, and I think it looks like big blocks or cubes, so I'll just draw a few squares. I'm not sure how to show that it melts into water, so I might try drawing some wavy lines next to the ice to represent water, although it might look pretty much like the ice rectangles too. To show when it melts, maybe I’ll just add some extra lines around the ice block like it's wet. I don’t really know how to show the ice turning back into ice after melting; I might skip that or just draw more of the same wavy lines again. I remember ice cream can melt, so maybe I'll draw an ice cream scoop next to the ice block and put some drips around it to show it melting, even though I think it doesn't get back to the same ice cream. I don't know how else to show heating or cooling, so it's mainly gonna be just ice blocks with some lines.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a science experiment. The drawing includes several simple, blue rectangles to represent ice blocks, with some blue wavy lines nearby meant to signify water. There's an attempt at drawing an ice cream cone with drips to show melting. The style is crude and simple, with lines being a bit shaky, as expected at an early elementary level. No distinct changes are shown from ice back to water. Include some lines around the ice blocks to indicate wetness or dripping, but no arrows or additional labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it describes an attempt to represent ice and water with simple shapes and unclear changes, consistent with the student's minimal understanding. The student incorrectly attempts to show reversible change with the melted ice cream, reflecting their misunderstanding. The lack of heating or cooling elements in the drawing aligns with the student's inability to explain processes like melting and freezing correctly."
