  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating or cooling, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, illustrating the change (e.g., ice turning into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, depicting the reversed change (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate both reversible and irreversible changes, labeling examples where changes can and cannot be reversed (e.g., ice and water vs. a cooked egg).",
    "The student can use their drawing to explain how heating or cooling causes changes, showing how some changes can be reversed and others cannot."
