  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the material (e.g., ice) before heating or cooling with clear labeling or recognizable symbols.",
    "The student can show the changes in the material after it is heated (e.g., ice becomes liquid water), accurately depicting the state change.",
    "The student can depict the change in the material after cooling (e.g., water becomes ice again), representing this process visually.",
    "The student can indicate which changes are reversible, particularly the melting and refreezing of ice, though they may have simpler labels for these processes.",
    "The student can connect in their drawing how heating and cooling cause changes and may show some patterns of state changes, though possibly with occasional missing details.",
    "The student can represent with evidence in their drawing that connects heating and cooling to the observed effects, generally capturing the cause-effect relationship."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently show all label details, sometimes omitting finer annotations or symbols identifying the start and end states clearly.",
    "The student may occasionally misunderstand or omit labeling of non-reversible changes (e.g., offerings a correct example often, but forgetting or misidentifying them occasionally as reversible).",
    "The student might not always perfectly connect patterns over several cycles of heating and cooling, showing the process once accurately but omitting repetition or missing subtle patterns.",
    "The student may show partial evidence in their effects connection, occasionally failing to fully explore the cause in instances where cause-effect should be expanded (e.g., assuming ice melts only due to external heat sources without considering ambient temperature)."
