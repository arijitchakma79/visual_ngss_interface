  "Reasoning": "To start my drawing, I’ll show a piece of ice. I'll draw a blue rectangle and label it 'Ice' at the beginning, making sure to indicate that it is cold. Next, I’ll illustrate what happens when ice is heated. I know ice turns into water, so I'll draw water drops or a small puddle with arrows indicating the change from ice to water. I'll label 'Water' next to this. I'll try to show that this is because of heating, maybe by drawing a small sun or a thermometer with rising temperature nearby. To depict freezing again, I'll show water becoming ice on the other side of the drawing. I'll draw arrows from water back to ice, label it, 'Ice again,' and maybe a cloud or snowflake to indicate cooling. I'll write 'reversible change' between these states to show I understand it can go back and forth. I remember that I should try to show how heat affects this change. I might forget to add a source for cooling other than the cloud, and I probably won't label non-reversible changes since I’m focused on the ice cycle. Overall, my drawing should clearly show these changes, even if I miss some details like ambient temperature affecting the process.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing a piece of blue ice labeled 'Ice' on the left side. Arrows point from the ice to a puddle of water labeled 'Water' in the middle, indicating melting. Above the melting process is a sun, representing heating. More arrows point from the water back to a piece of ice on the right side, labeled 'Ice again' with a cloud or snowflake above to indicate cooling. The text 'reversible change' is written between the ice and water states. The drawing is colorful and simple, representing a third grader's work with clear but basic labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's proficiency by showing an understanding of reversible changes, such as ice melting and refreezing, with clear labels for ice and water. It includes simple symbols like a sun for heating and a snowflake for cooling, which aligns with the student's ability to depict the cause-effect relationship, though more ambient temperature factors might be absent. The labeling and depiction are straightforward, with some reversible elements missing more intricate details, which is consistent with the student's proficiency level and expected areas of struggle."
