  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material (e.g., ice) before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show the changes in the material after it is heated (e.g., ice becomes liquid water).",
    "The student can depict the change in the material after cooling (e.g., water becomes ice again).",
    "The student can indicate which changes are reversible (e.g., melting and refreezing of ice) and which are not (e.g., cooking an egg).",
    "The student can connect in their drawing how heating and cooling cause certain changes and what patterns are observable.",
    "The student can represent with evidence in their drawing that connects the cause (heating or cooling) to the observed effects (change in state of material)."
