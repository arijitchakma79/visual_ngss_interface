  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a claim showing that some changes caused by heating (like ice melting) can be reversed.",
    "The student can draw the characteristics of a material (e.g., ice) before it is heated.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of the same material after it has been heated (e.g., water after ice melts).",
    "The student can draw the characteristics of the material after it is cooled again (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can depict a sequence that shows the reversible change from ice to water and back to ice.",
    "The student can use visual elements to explain that heating can cause ice to melt into water and cooling can change it back to ice.",
    "The student can show a clear cause and effect relationship in their drawing, expressing how heating and cooling lead to observable changes."
