  "Reasoning": "I’ll start my drawing. First, I remember that ice is solid, so I will draw some ice cubes. They’re usually square, so I will make several squares on the left side of the page. Next, I’ll show what happens when ice melts - I know it turns into water. I picture a little puddle of water, so I’ll draw that next to the ice cubes. I need to show how the change happens. I remember hearing about arrows showing the change, so I'll put an arrow pointing from the ice to the water, but I might forget to say if it's melting or heating that makes this happen. Now, I should show the water turning back into ice, but I’m not exactly sure how to show that clearly, so I’ll draw another arrow but it might be pointing the wrong way or missing. I think about labeling them. I'll try to label the ice as 'ice' and the water as 'water', but I might forget to label the arrows or the process itself. My arrow might only point from ice to water and I might forget or find it tricky to indicate the freezing part. Let's go ahead.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing depicting reversible changes through ice melting. On the left, there are several drawn blue squares representing ice cubes. To the right, a simple blue puddle illustrates melted water. A large black arrow runs from the ice cubes to the puddle, but there is no return arrow or other labeling to show it turning back. The words 'ice' and 'water' might be present, lightly penciled, or missing. The style is basic and childlike, with bold colors and simple lines. The setting is on a piece of plain white paper, with a youthful touch seen in uneven shapes and simple representations.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's current abilities and misunderstandings. The student can draw ice and water but struggles to show the full reversible change process. Their use of arrows is incomplete, demonstrating an emerging understanding of cause and effect. Labels might be missing or incomplete due to some confusion, and the setting is simple, consistent with a developing level of skill."
