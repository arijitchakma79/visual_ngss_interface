  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of ice before it is heated, such as cubes or a solid block.",
    "The student can illustrate water after ice has melted, likely showing a puddle or small pool of water.",
    "The student can attempt to depict a sequence from ice to water, though it may lack clear transitions."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student struggles to effectively show water turning back into ice after cooling (sequence may be incomplete or unclear).",
    "The student may forget or incorrectly draw arrows to indicate the process of heating and cooling, missing clear cause and effect.",
    "The student might not show or mislabel the stages effectively (e.g., mixing stages, forgetting to label 'ice', 'water', or 'melted').",
    "There may be confusion in showing that heating causes melting and cooling causes freezing (arrows might point the wrong way or not exist).",
    "The concept that the process is reversible might not be depicted or understood clearly (misconception that once melted, it does not change back)."
