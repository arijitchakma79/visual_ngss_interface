  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big block of ice. I remember that ice is solid and looks kind of cubical, so I'll make sure to draw straight edges. I'll try to make it look cold by adding some light blue shading on top. Next, I need to draw an arrow pointing to the next step where the ice melts. The arrow shows that the ice is turning into water because it's heated. I'll draw some wavy lines for the water below the arrow. Now, I have to think about how water turns back into ice. I'll draw another arrow pointing from the water back up to another cube of ice. This shows cooling. I'll add some arrows and labels to show 'melting' and 'freezing'. I need to be careful with my labels, but sometimes I forget or mix up which is which. I hope I remember to draw arrows clearly marked with heating and cooling directions. Sometimes I leave out an arrow or it's not really pointing the right way, so I need to concentrate on that part. Lastly, I'll use a couple of colors like blue for ice, a darker blue for water, and maybe red for heating arrows and blue for cooling ones to make the drawing clear.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn illustration of reversible change showing ice melting and refreezing. A large cube of ice, shaded light blue, with sharp, straight edges is on the left. An arrow points to the right where there are wavy lines representing water in a darker blue. Another arrow points from the water back up to a second light blue ice cube. The arrows are colored red for heating and blue for cooling. The drawing includes labels like 'melting' and 'freezing'. Drawn in a simple, colorful sketch style suitable for a school science project.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by detailing a clear process of reversible change using arrows and color cues to indicate heating and cooling, reflecting their understanding of cause and effect. Labeled processes like 'melting' and 'freezing' are included, recognizing the areas where the student needs to be careful, though they sometimes mishandle labels or arrow directions as noted in their struggles."
