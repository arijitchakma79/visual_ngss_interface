  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of ice before it melts, showing what ice looks like when it is solid and cold.",
    "The student can draw what the ice looks like after it melts into water, showing the change caused by heating.",
    "The student can draw the reversible change by showing water being cooled back into ice, illustrating that the process can go both ways.",
    "The student can use arrows to illustrate the process and effects of heating and cooling, showing cause and effect relationships."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may sometimes miss labeling which parts are before and after heating or cooling, or the labeling might be incomplete or unclear.",
    "The student might use arrows inconsistently, occasionally leaving out an arrow or drawing one that doesnâ€™t quite align with the process steps. *(inconsistent application)*"
