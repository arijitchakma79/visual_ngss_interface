  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of ice before it melts, showing what ice looks like when it is solid and cold.",
    "The student can draw what the ice looks like after it melts into water, showing the change caused by heating.",
    "The student can draw the reversible change by showing water being cooled back into ice, illustrating that the process can go both ways.",
    "The student can label their drawings to indicate which parts are before and after heating or cooling.",
    "The student can use arrows to illustrate the process and effects of heating and cooling, showing cause and effect relationships."
