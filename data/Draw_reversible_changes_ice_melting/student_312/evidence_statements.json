  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the initial appearance of the ice before it melts.",
    "The student can draw the appearance of the water after the ice has melted.",
    "The student can draw the appearance of the ice after the water is frozen again.",
    "The student can label or show through drawing that ice melting into water is a reversible change.",
    "The student can indicate with arrows or labels the sequence of the changes: ice melts to water, water freezes back to ice.",
    "The student can illustrate that heating the ice causes it to melt, and cooling the water causes it to freeze back into ice."
