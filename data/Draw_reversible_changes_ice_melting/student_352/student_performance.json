  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the appearance of ice before and after it melts into water with accurate representations of both phases.",
    "The student can draw water being cooled back into ice, clearly showing the reversible change with appropriate labels.",
    "The student can illustrate a different change, such as a raw egg being cooked, to show a change that is not reversible.",
    "The student can include labels or short descriptions explaining what happens when ice melts and freezes again, such as 'ice melting into water' and 'water freezing into ice'.",
    "The student can represent the cause (heating or cooling) and effect (melting into water or freezing into ice) in their drawings, possibly using arrows to indicate the direction of change."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit a label or description in minor areas, but this does not affect their overall understanding.",
    "The student might sometimes use inconsistent styles for arrows or labels (e.g., varying sizes or directions), but the overall meaning is still clear."
