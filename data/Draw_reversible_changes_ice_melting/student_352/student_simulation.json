  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember that ice should look solid, so I'll use a bluish-white color and maybe a bit of shading to show it's cold and solid. Next, I'll draw an arrow to indicate it's melting. I'll color water in light blue to show it's different from solid ice, and add ripples to make it look like liquid. Now, to show reversal, I'll draw another arrow pointing back to ice, making sure to label this 'water freezing into ice' and the previous one 'ice melting into water'. I want the arrows to be clear, so I'll make them thick and easy to see. Since I'm advanced in this, I'll add a sketch of a raw egg and another of a cooked egg to show a non-reversible change. I'll label them 'raw egg' and 'cooked egg' with a red cross to indicate the change can't be reversed. I might forget a label on a minor detail, like the ripples in water, but the main ideas will still be clear.",
  "Prompt": "Create an illustration showing a sequence of reversible changes involving ice melting and freezing again. The drawing should include: 1) A solid block of ice, colored bluish-white with shading to show it's cold and solid. 2) An arrow labeled ‘ice melting into water’. 3) A pool of water with light blue color and ripples. 4) An arrow labeled ‘water freezing into ice’ pointing back to the ice block. 5) Alongside, include an illustration of a raw egg and a cooked egg, with the labels ‘raw egg’ and ‘cooked egg’, and a red cross between them to indicate the change is not reversible. The style should be clear and educational, suitable for a student at an advanced level, using bold lines and labels in consistent styles, occasionally omitting minor label details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities by highlighting detailed elements like cold shading for the ice, light blue for water, and clear labeling of processes with arrows. It aligns with the student's advanced level by including both reversible and non-reversible changes, utilizing labels like 'ice melting into water'. Arrows are used consistently to convey processes, even though some minor details might lack labels, capturing the student’s occasional oversight in areas that do not affect core understanding."
