  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the appearance of ice before and after it melts into water.",
    "The student can draw water being cooled back into ice, showing that this change is reversible.",
    "The student can illustrate a different change, such as a raw egg being cooked, to show a change that is not reversible.",
    "The student can include labels or short descriptions explaining what happens when ice melts and freezes again.",
    "The student can represent the cause (heating or cooling) and effect (melting into water or freezing into ice) in their drawings."
