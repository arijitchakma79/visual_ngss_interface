  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a detailed picture showing ice in its solid form before heating, with clear labeling such as 'Solid Ice'.",
    "The student can depict water after the ice melts due to heating, accurately labeling it as 'Liquid Water'.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of cooling the melted water back into ice, labeling it as 'Refrozen Ice'.",
    "The student consistently labels their drawings to clearly show the changes between solid and liquid states and indicate the reversibility of this process.",
    "The student uses drawings to successfully support a claim that the cycle of ice melting and refreezing is a reversible change, demonstrating understanding in both illustrations and written explanation."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally forget to include directional arrows to indicate temperature changes in their drawings (minor omission, typically corrected).",
    "Some labels might be less neatly written or slightly misplaced, though generally still clear enough to convey understanding (minor oversight, not affecting overall comprehension)."
