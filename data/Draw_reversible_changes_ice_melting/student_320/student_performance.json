  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and accurately label ice in its initial solid state before heating.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the process of ice melting into water, clearly showing the change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can depict and label the process of water freezing back into ice, showcasing the reversed change.",
    "The student can identify and correctly label which changes are reversible within their drawings, demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept.",
    "The student can explain through their drawing how changes like ice to water to ice are reversible, and how other changes (e.g., a cooked egg) are not.",
    "The student can clearly show through illustrations how reversible changes follow a cause-and-effect pattern, including arrows or other indicators of directionality."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit minor labels or annotations, such as not clearly labeling the temperature changes involved in the process (incomplete labeling).",
    "The student may inconsistently apply small details, like slightly unclear arrows indicating the process direction from water freezing back to ice (minor gaps in directional indicators)."
