  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the material (like ice) in its initial state before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the change in the material after it is heated (e.g., ice becoming water).",
    "The student can depict the reversed change when the material is cooled again (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can identify and label which changes are reversible and which are not within their drawings.",
    "The student can explain through their drawing how some changes can go back and forth (e.g., ice to water to ice), while others cannot (e.g., cooked egg).",
    "The student can show through illustrations how reversible changes follow a cause-and-effect pattern."
