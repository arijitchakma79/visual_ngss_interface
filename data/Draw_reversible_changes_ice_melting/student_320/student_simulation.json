  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big block of solid ice. I know I need to label it 'solid ice', and I'll make it blue to show it's cold. Next to it, I'll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle of water, which I'll label 'liquid water'. This shows the ice melting. I remember the ice is melting because of heat, but I might forget to note the exact temperature changes. Then, I'll draw another arrow going back from the water to a new block of ice, and I'll label this 'ice from freezing'. I'll try to show that this change goes both ways by using arrows. I have to write 'reversible change' somewhere, maybe above the whole picture, to demonstrate I understand the concept. Remember, I have to make it clear that this is a reversible process, unlike cooking an egg, which I'll just mention without drawing. Finally, I'll highlight the direction of changes with arrows to show cause and effect. The arrows might not be perfectly straight, though.",
  "Prompt": "Illustrate a sequence of changes depicting ice melting and refreezing. Start with a block of solid ice on the left, colored in a cool shade of blue and labeled 'solid ice'. Draw a wide arrow pointing from the ice to a puddle of water, colored clear and labeled 'liquid water', indicating the melting process. Next, show an arrow from the water back to a newly formed ice block, again in blue, labeled 'ice from freezing'. Add 'reversible change' at the top of the illustration. Use colorful, clear labels, but show slight inconsistencies or omissions, such as not highlighting temperature changes. The arrows should be present and visible but may slightly lack clarity in the refreezing direction.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can accurately do, such as drawing and labeling the ice and water states and indicating the reversible nature with arrows. It also incorporates where they might struggle, like omitting detailed temperature labels and having slightly unclear directional arrows, matching the student's level."
