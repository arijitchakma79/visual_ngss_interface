  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing its original state, with ice as a solid block.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, showing how it changes into liquid water.",
    "The student can illustrate that ice melting into water and freezing back into ice is a reversible change.",
    "The student can draw and label the cause of change, indicating heating and cooling processes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label or draw the material after the change is reversed, sometimes omitting labels indicating the return to ice.",
    "The student may partially or unclearly draw a comparison of changes that are not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg), potentially omitting details or incorrectly showing the sequence of irreversible change."
