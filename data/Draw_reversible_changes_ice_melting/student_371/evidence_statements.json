  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing its original state (e.g., ice as a solid block).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, showing how it changes (e.g., ice turning into liquid water).",
    "The student can draw the material after the change is reversed, showing it back to its original state (e.g., liquid water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change in the material is reversible (e.g., ice can melt into water and then freeze back into ice).",
    "The student can draw a comparison of changes that are not reversible when heating (e.g., a cooked egg cannot go back to being a raw egg).",
    "The student can show understanding of cause and effect by drawing and labeling what causes the material to change (e.g., heating or cooling causes ice to change states)."
