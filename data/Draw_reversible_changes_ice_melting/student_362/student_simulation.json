  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing ice cubes to show the ice in its solid state before it's heated. I know that ice is solid and is usually cube-shaped when we take it out from a tray. Next, I'll try to show the ice starting to melt. I’ll draw some of the ice turning to water, leaving some parts as solid. I remember that heat causes ice to melt, so maybe I’ll add a small sun or heat waves to show this process. Now, I should also try to show how water can turn back into ice. Hmm, I know that freezing can make water into ice, so I'll add an arrow going back to an ice block, although I'm not sure how to draw the freezing part well. I think I'll just leave it at that because I’m not really sure how to show ice forming from water again. I might use blue to color the ice and blue with some white lines to show the water dripping.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing the process of ice melting and partially re-freezing. Start with clearly drawn ice cubes on the left, colored in light blue. To the right, depict the cubes starting to melt, with some parts still solid and some turning into water, using blue with some white lines for the water. Add small heat waves or a tiny sun above the melting ice to signify heat. Include a simple arrow pointing back to an ice block to suggest refreezing, although not clearly showing the ice forming again. Use pencil and crayons for a basic drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by illustrating solid ice and partially melted ice with attention to the melting effects caused by heat. The student attempts, but struggles, to show the water turning back into ice, reflected by an arrow suggesting refreezing. However, it does not effectively illustrate the complete process, aligning with the struggle to demonstrate fully reversible changes or highlight cooling effects consistently."
