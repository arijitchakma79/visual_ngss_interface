  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (such as ice) before it is heated, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can draw the material (such as water) after it is heated, showing the change caused by heating.",
    "The student can draw the material (such as water turning back into ice) if the change is reversible, illustrating the concept of freezing.",
    "The student can show through their drawing which changes can and cannot be reversed by providing examples of both.",
    "The student can use their drawing to highlight observable patterns and effects caused by heating and cooling."
