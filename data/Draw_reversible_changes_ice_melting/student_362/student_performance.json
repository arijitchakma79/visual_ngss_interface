  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice in its solid state, showing it before it is heated. (student correctly depicts ice cubes or blocks)",
    "The student can partially show the ice turning to water after heating, possibly depicting some melting. (student shows ice starting to melt, with some parts still solid)",
    "The student can attempt to demonstrate that water can turn back into ice under certain conditions, though with inconsistent success. (may add arrows to switch back to ice form)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show the complete process of freezing after melting. (student may draw water but not show it turning back to ice effectively)",
    "The student may misunderstand reversible changes, not clearly indicating which changes can be reversed. (e.g., may think all changes are reversible)",
    "The student might not consistently highlight patterns or effects of heating and cooling. (student might miss illustrating cooling effects visually)"
