  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw an illustration of ice before it undergoes change, such as a block of ice with basic features like straight lines and a blue color to indicate it is solid.",
    "The student can show that the ice has melted into water using a basic drawing with wavy lines or blue color to hint at a liquid state after heating.",
    "The student can depict that water can refreeze into ice using arrows to indicate change, even if not detailed."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly demonstrate how the ice returns to its original state, perhaps missing labels or drawing unclear transitions when water refreezes into ice.",
    "The student might not identify or illustrate a change where the material does not return to its original state (e.g., they might not know how to depict a cooked egg staying solid).",
    "The student may not be able to accurately label their drawing to indicate which changes are reversible or irreversible (mixed or missing labels may occur)."
