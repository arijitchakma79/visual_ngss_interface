  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material (e.g., ice) before it undergoes a change due to heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show what happens to the material after it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice turning into water).",
    "The student can depict how the material changes after the heating or cooling is reversed (e.g., water refreezing into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate how some changes, like ice melting and refreezing, can be reversed.",
    "The student can identify and illustrate a change where the material does not return to its original state (e.g., a cooked egg stays solid).",
    "The student can label their drawing to indicate whether each change is reversible or not."
