  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember ice is solid, so I'll use straight lines to make it look like a square or rectangle. I'll color it blue because ice is cold and has this color in my mind. Now I need to show that the ice melts into water. I'll draw a few wavy lines to show the water by the side of the ice block. Maybe I'll color it light blue or blue too since water is usually drawn that way. I kind of understand that the water can turn back into ice, so I'll put an arrow from the water back to another block of ice. But I also remember I need to show that the melted water turns solid again. I feel like I need more labels to explain my drawing, but I'm not sure which changes are called reversible or how to label them. I'll just focus on the drawings for now.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene featuring a block of ice on one side and a puddle of water on the other. The ice should be depicted with straight lines, colored blue to show it is solid. The water should be illustrated with wavy lines and a light blue color to suggest it is a liquid. Include two arrows: one going from the block of ice to the puddle of water, and another from the water back to a new block of ice. Use a basic drawing style typical for elementary school students, with simple shapes and colors.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities because it focuses on straightforward representations like straight and wavy lines with colors to distinguish states of matter. It includes arrows to suggest change, in line with the student's understanding of reversible processes, but lacks detailed transitions or labels due to their struggle with accurately naming reversible changes. The prompt aligns with their emerging understanding and captures the basic elements they can illustrate."
