  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice before it melts, showing a basic depiction of a frozen structure (e.g., block or cube).",
    "The student can illustrate the transition from ice to water, possibly with some representation of melting (e.g., water droplets or puddles).",
    "The student can include some arrows indicating the direction of change, even if not consistently accurate."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not accurately depict the cooling process leading back to ice; might show water but not the ice formation again *(student misunderstands reversibility)*.",
    "The student likely does not label which parts of the process are reversible or label them incorrectly *(student does not fully grasp reversibility concept)*.",
    "The student may not use cause and effect labels clearly, possibly not connecting heating with melting and cooling with freezing correctly *(student mixes up processes or labels interchangeably)*."
