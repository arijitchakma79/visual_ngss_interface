  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before heating, showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes in the material (ice to water) after heating.",
    "The student can draw the process of cooling, showing water becoming ice again.",
    "The student can depict which parts of the process are reversible and label them.",
    "The student can use labels to explain cause and effect, showing how heating leads to melting and cooling leads to freezing."
