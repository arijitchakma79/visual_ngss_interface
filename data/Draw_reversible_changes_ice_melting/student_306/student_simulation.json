  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw what happens when ice melts because I think I kind of get it. First, I’ll draw a big, blocky ice cube. I know ice is usually around this shape and it’s solid. All solid. Next, I should show what happens when it melts. Maybe I’ll draw some of it dripping, like into a puddle of water below the ice. Yeah, that shows melting! Hmm, arrows are needed to show the direction everything goes. I’ll draw an arrow from the ice to the puddle and from some droplets too. Now, I remember something about it being able to go back to ice, but that’s tricky. I’ll just leave it at water for now; I’m not sure how to show it going back. I think I might also forget how to label this clearly, like which is cause and effect, but maybe that’s okay for now.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing three stages: on the left, a simple blue ice cube with a rough outline; in the middle, a few blue droplets falling, and on the right, a small puddle of water on the ground. Arrows are drawn in black, moving from the ice cube to the droplet to the puddle. The drawing is colorful but lacks clear labels or detailed representations of process reversibility. The arrows are the only indicators of change, shown in a simple, crayon-like style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw the initial ice structure and the transition to water. It also includes arrows to suggest directionality of change, aligning with what the student can do. The absence of depicting the reverse process of water turning back to ice, or the lack of clear labels, reflects the student's misunderstanding and inability to show reversibility clearly or label cause and effect accurately."
