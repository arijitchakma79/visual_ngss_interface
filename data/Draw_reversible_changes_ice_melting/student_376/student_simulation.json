  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of solid ice. I know ice is water in its solid state, so I'll draw a cube and color it light blue. I'll remember to label it as 'Ice (Solid)' to make it clear. Next, I'll show the melting process by drawing an arrow pointing from the ice to a puddle of water. The puddle should be blue with maybe a few drops to represent liquid. I'll label this 'Water (Liquid)'. I'll draw another arrow going from the puddle back to a new ice cube, showing that freezing can reverse melting. I'll label this 'Freezing' and the ice as 'Ice (Solid)'. I'll try not to forget water droplets in the melting phase, but I might leave out a couple of small details like that. Now, I have to show an irreversible change. I'll draw a cooked egg because I know that can't change back into its raw form. I'll color the egg yellow and white, and write a note like 'Cooking: Irreversible' explaining why it can't turn back into raw egg. I might accidentally misplace an arrow or have a label a little off, but I'll try to make sure everything makes sense overall.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a sequence of images showing reversible and irreversible changes due to heating and cooling. Start with a light blue cube labeled 'Ice (Solid)' followed by an arrow pointing to a blue puddle labeled 'Water (Liquid)', then draw another arrow pointing to another light blue cube labeled 'Ice (Solid)'. Show water droplets and clear labels like 'Melting' and 'Freezing'. Include a separate drawing of a cooked egg, colored yellow and white, labeled 'Cooking: Irreversible'. The style should be hand-drawn with clear lines, using bright colors for clarity.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt includes the full process of reversible changes for ice melting and freezing, with clear labels and colors as the student at level 4 would do. It notes potential minor omissions in details, like water droplets, reflecting the student's possible struggles. The inclusion of an irreversible change with clear captions shows understanding, aligning with the student's capabilities and limitations."
