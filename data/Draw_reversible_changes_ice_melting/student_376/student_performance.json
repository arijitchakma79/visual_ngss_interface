  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the material before heating, clearly depicting it as solid ice with appropriate labels.",
    "The student can effectively show the melting process by drawing the ice turning into water with clear labels and possibly arrows indicating the change.",
    "The student can draw the freezing process where water turns back into ice, labeling the stages accurately and using arrows to indicate the change.",
    "The student can identify, label, and explain which changes are reversible, clearly marking the transitions between ice to water and back to ice.",
    "The student can draw a change caused by heating or cooling that is not reversible, such as a cooked egg, and write a brief explanation clarifying why it cannot revert back to its original form."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may forget to add minor details or labels in one of the drawings, like omitting water droplets in the melting phase, but this does not reflect a conceptual misunderstanding.",
    "The student might occasionally misplace an arrow or label slightly off the intended area, but it is clear from context what they mean."
