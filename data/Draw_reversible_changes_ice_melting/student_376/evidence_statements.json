  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its original state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, representing how it changes (e.g., melted ice turns into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling it again, illustrating the change back to the original state (e.g., water freezes back into ice).",
    "The student can identify and label in their drawing which changes are reversible (e.g., ice to water and back to ice).",
    "The student can draw an example of a change caused by heating or cooling that is not reversible, and explain briefly why it can't change back (e.g., cooked egg cannot become a raw egg again)."
