  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw an ice cube before it melts, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can draw the ice cube as it melts into water, demonstrating an understanding that a change occurs.",
    "The student might attempt to use arrows or annotations to show heating and cooling, but with inconsistency."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to accurately depict the water being frozen back into an ice cube, and may not clearly show the reversible change from liquid back to solid.",
    "The student might not include or mislabel which changes are caused by heating (melting) and which by cooling (freezing) (e.g., forgetting to label or mixing up terms).",
    "The student might not clearly show how the same material looks different in solid and liquid forms, or the differences may be inaccurately or vaguely represented.",
    "The step-by-step changes might be incomplete, with missing steps in the process of melting and refreezing."
