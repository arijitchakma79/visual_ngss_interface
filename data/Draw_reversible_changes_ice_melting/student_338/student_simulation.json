  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a square shape to represent the ice cube before it melts. I remember that an ice cube is solid, so I'll make sure to color it light blue to show the coldness. Next, I'll draw an arrow from the ice cube to a puddle of water to show that it's melting. I'll make the water puddle nearby and color it a darker blue to show it’s different from the solid ice cube. I should probably use arrows or something to show that heating is causing the ice to melt, but I'm a bit unsure how to clearly label that. I think I'll just draw arrows pointing upwards from the puddle but might forget to label them properly as 'heat'. Now, for freezing, I'm supposed to draw the water turning back into ice, but that's confusing. I can't remember how to show it freezing again, so I think I might skip that part. I know the ice and water are the same material, but my drawing doesn’t really make that clear because the water looks quite different from the ice cube. I'm also not sure how to show the full cycle of melting and refreezing, so I'll leave out the freezing part. I hope the initial melting drawing is okay.",
  "Prompt": "A student’s drawing showing an ice cube and melting process. The image should have a light blue square that represents an ice cube on the left side of the page. Next to the ice cube, draw a puddle of water in a darker blue. Include an arrow from the ice cube pointing to the water, but don’t label the arrow. There are additional arrows above the puddle to represent the heat but they are unlabeled. The drawing should appear simple and might miss finer details like the complete melting-freezing cycle, suitable for a developing understanding at second grade level.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's capabilities by including a clear depiction of the ice cube and its melting into water, with basic arrows indicating change. It doesn’t require clear labeling or a complete cycle of change, which aligns with the student's struggle to accurately depict freezing and potentially mislabel changes. The use of different blues attempts to show material differences, though not clearly marked, matching the student's emerging understanding of the topic."
