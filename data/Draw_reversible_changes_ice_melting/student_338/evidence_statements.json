  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw an ice cube before it melts, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can draw the ice cube as it melts into water, demonstrating the change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can draw the water being frozen back into an ice cube, showing the reversible change from liquid back to solid.",
    "The student can label their drawings to show which changes are caused by heating (melting) and which by cooling (freezing).",
    "The student can include in their drawing how the same material can look different in solid and liquid forms.",
    "The student can show a step-by-step change, illustrating the process of melting and refreezing.",
    "The student can use arrows or annotations to represent the cause and effect of heating and cooling on the ice/water."
