  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a basic representation of ice and water, but it might lack detail or accuracy.",
    "The student might use simple shapes or symbols to indicate ice and water, such as a cube and wavy lines."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to correctly indicate how ice changes to water when heated (e.g., might not draw any heat source or arrows indicating transformation).",
    "The student does not show how water changes back to ice when cooled (e.g., might not include any symbols for cooling).",
    "The distinction between reversible and irreversible changes is missing or incorrect (e.g., student thinks ice melting is permanent).",
    "The student might not clearly show characteristics of the material before and after heating (e.g., ice and water look the same).",
    "The cause and effect relationship, represented by heating and cooling leading to a change of state, is absent or misstated (e.g., might draw arrows in incorrect directions or none at all)."
