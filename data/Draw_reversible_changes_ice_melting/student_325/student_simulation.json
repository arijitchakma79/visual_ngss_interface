  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I'm supposed to draw something about ice melting and how it's a reversible change. I remember that ice can turn into water. So, I'll start with a big cube to show the ice. Ice looks like a cube, right? Then for water, I think I'll draw some wavy lines next to the cube because water is kind of wavy. I think ice melts when it gets hot, but I'm not sure how to show that, so I'll just leave it. I also remember that if I put water in a freezer, it turns into ice again. Maybe I should draw something to show cooling? But I'm not sure how to draw that, so I'll skip it. I'm not really sure about how to show ice going back to water either. I'll just make sure my cube looks separate from the wavy lines so people know one is ice and one is water. Hopefully that's enough.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, cartoon-style image of a large cube to represent ice and several wavy lines to represent water. The ice cube should be on one side of the paper, and the wavy lines on the other. Use blue to color both the ice cube and water. The background should be blank, with no visible indicators of heat or cooling processes. Ensure there's no arrows or additional symbols to explain the transformation between ice and water, as the student is unsure about these concepts.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do because it includes basic representations of ice and water using simple shapesâ€”a cube and wavy lines. It lacks detail, aligning with the student's minimal understanding. The drawing misses features the student struggles with, such as indicators of transformation between states, cooling, heating, or understanding the reversible nature of the change, all of which are absent, consistent with the student's misunderstandings."
