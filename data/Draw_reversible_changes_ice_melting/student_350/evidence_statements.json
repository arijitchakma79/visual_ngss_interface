  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after it is heated, indicating the change (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can demonstrate through drawing whether the change after heating is reversible (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after it has cooled back, showing the reformed or unchanged state (e.g., water turning back into solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether changes caused by cooling are reversible and explain this through their drawing.",
    "The student can use their drawings to claim whether the observed changes in materials are reversible, supported by visual evidence.",
    "The student can show cause and effect in their drawings, highlighting the sequence of changes and how they lead to observable patterns."
