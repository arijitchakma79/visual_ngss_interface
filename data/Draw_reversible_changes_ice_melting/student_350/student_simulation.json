  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of solid ice. I remember ice is solid and kind of see-through, so I'll use a light blue color to show that. I just need to make sure it's big enough to be noticed. Next, I'll show the melting process. I think if I draw a puddle next to the ice block, it looks like some of the ice has turned into water. I'll use the blue color again to make sure it looks like water. Now, I should show the freezing again. Maybe I can draw another piece of ice forming next to the water. I'll try to make it look like ice is starting to appear near the puddle. I can't remember how to show that this change is reversible. Maybe I should use arrows, but I'm not sure where they go or how to draw them properly. I hope that's okay. Also, I know drawing the cause and effect isn't easy, and I don't really know how to show heating and cooling with arrows yet.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing shows a simple scene of ice melting. There is a solid block of light blue ice on the left and a small puddle of blue water to the right of it. Another small piece of ice appears by the puddle, indicating refreezing but with minimal detail. The drawing lacks arrows or annotations to clearly show processes like heating, cooling, or reversibility. Use crayon-style coloring on paper.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict a simple ice melting scenario with basic elements, like an ice block and a puddle to show melting. It acknowledges the student's difficulty showing reversibility and cause and effect without arrows or detailed annotations, aligning with the student's current understanding and limitations."
