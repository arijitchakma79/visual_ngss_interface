  "Reasoning": "I know I have to draw about ice melting, but I'm not sure how to show all the changes. I'll start by drawing a shape that looks like ice. I think ice is shaped like a cube, so I'll draw a simple square. I remember that ice is kind of smooth-looking, so I won't add any texture. Now, I need to show it turning into water. I'll draw another shape next to it. Maybe I’ll make a wavy shape to show the water. I don't really know how to show the ice turning into water step-by-step, so I'll just leave it as two separate shapes. I don't remember or understand that ice can turn back into its original form, so I’ll just focus on what I've drawn.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple two-part illustration with a basic square on the left side to represent ice and a wavy shape on the right side to represent water. Both shapes should be plain with no texture or color variations, drawn with a basic crayon. The background should be white, and there should be no labels or detailed transition shown between the ice and water shapes.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt matches the student's capabilities by showing a basic shape for ice and a simple representation for water, without any detailed transition. It reflects their struggle by not including labels or captions, and omitting the refreezing process. This aligns with the student's minimal understanding of reversible changes and highlights inaccuracies or lack of detail in the melting process depiction."
