  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before it is heated or cooled, showing its original characteristics.",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, illustrating the change (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after the heating is reversed (e.g., water refreezing into ice), showing the characteristics of the material in its new form.",
    "The student can include labels or captions in their drawings to explain which changes are reversible and which are not, using simple terms.",
    "The student can use drawings to connect the idea that some changes are reversible by cooling or heating (e.g., melted ice can become ice again when it is cooled)."
