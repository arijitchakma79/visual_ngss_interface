  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating or cooling (e.g., ice as a solid).",
    "The student can depict the material after heating (e.g., ice becomes liquid water).",
    "The student can show the material after cooling again (e.g., liquid water becomes ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate through drawings which changes are reversible (e.g., ice melting and refreezing) and which are not (e.g., a cooked egg cannot be reverted to a raw egg).",
    "The student can include a scene that visually represents the cause and effect of heating and cooling on materials.",
    "The student can annotate their drawings with simple explanations connecting the changes observed to the process of heating and cooling, including reversibility."
