  "Reasoning": "Okay, I'm going to draw a picture of reversible changes with ice melting and then refreezing. First, I'll draw a solid block of ice. I need to show it as a cube because that's easy to recognize. I remember that ice melts into water, so next to the ice, I'll draw a puddle of water. I'll use blue color to show the ice and a lighter blue for the water. Now, I need to show how melting happens, like when the ice is under the sun. I'll draw a sun with rays pointing towards the ice to show the sun's heat. Next, to show reversibility, I should draw how water turns back into ice. I'll sketch a simple drawing of a freezer near the water. Maybe I'll try to draw the water with some cooling lines indicating it's freezing back into ice. I'm not sure how to explain the cooling part well, so I won't add detailed notes. I’ll focus on making sure the ice and water look different and show how they can change back and forth. I might get confused if I think about irreversible changes, so I’ll stick to what I know about ice and water.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a reversible change showing ice melting and refreezing. On the left, there is a blue ice cube. Next to the ice, draw a puddle of lighter blue water. Above the ice, illustrate a bright yellow sun with rays to indicate warmth. Nearby, on the right, include a simple depiction of a freezer with cooling lines around some of the puddle water, indicating it's turning back to ice. Use a simple drawing style, suitable for elementary school, with basic colors and clear distinctions between the ice and water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate the ice and water transition clearly, sticking to the reversible process of melting and freezing, without going into complex irreversible changes. The sun and freezer elements help convey cause and effect, which matches the student's level of understanding. The prompt avoids detailed annotations about cooling, in line with the student's challenge in consistently explaining this process."
