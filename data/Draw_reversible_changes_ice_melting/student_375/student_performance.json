  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating as a solid block of ice.",
    "The student can depict the melted ice as liquid water.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of freezing where liquid water becomes ice again, showing reversibility.",
    "The student is able to create a basic cause and effect scene, such as showing the sun causing ice to melt, or a freezer refreezing the water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently annotate their drawings comprehensively (e.g., missing explanation of how cooling leads to refreezing).",
    "The student may have minor issues distinguishing between reversible and irreversible changes with complex examples (e.g., properly explaining why a cooked egg cannot revert)."
