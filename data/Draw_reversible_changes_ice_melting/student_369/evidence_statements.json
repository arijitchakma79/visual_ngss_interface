  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "- The student can draw what a piece of ice looks like before it is heated.",
    "- The student can illustrate how ice changes to water after heating.",
    "- The student can show how water can change back into ice when cooled.",
    "- The student can demonstrate that this change (ice to water and back to ice) is reversible.",
    "- The student can include labels to indicate the process of heating and cooling in their drawing.",
    "- The student can connect their drawing to the concept that some changes can be reversed and some cannot."
