  "Reasoning": "I remember that I'm supposed to draw something about ice melting. Ice is usually a cube shape, so I'll try to draw a simple square or rectangle to look like ice. I don't really know what details to add to make it look exactly like ice. I'll add an arrow to show that maybe something is happening to the ice, but I'm not sure exactly what. I think melting means it turns into water, so I'll try to draw some water next to it, but I'm not sure how. I might just draw some blobs because that's what water looks like to me. I don't really know how to show it turning back into ice, so I think I'll just leave it like this. I don't get the heating and cooling parts at all, so I won't include them. I guess I've done everything I can think of related to the task.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing showing a poorly-sketched blue square representing ice. Next to it is an arrow, drawn without clear direction or meaning. Beside the arrow, there are wobbly, blob-like shapes attempting to depict water, but without clear form. The drawing lacks any labels or text related to heating or cooling, and there is no illustration of water turning back into ice. The style is very basic, with minimal attention to detail, using basic colors like blue for ice and an undefined color for water blobs.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to draw a basic shape for ice but illustrates their confusion in adding relevant details or accurately depicting changes. The inclusion of an arrow signifies their attempt to show a process, although they're unclear about its purpose. The blobs attempt to show water but demonstrate the student's misunderstanding, and the absence of elements representing reversibility or labels reflects their struggle to comprehend these concepts."
