  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "- The student can draw a simple shape to represent ice, but it may lack detail or clarity.",
    "- The student might include a single arrow, possibly with confusion about its significance.",
    "- The student might show an attempt to depict water but may confuse its form or state (e.g., blobs unrelated to the ice)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "- The student is unlikely to accurately show the change from ice to water (misunderstands the process of melting).",
    "- The student does not illustrate the water changing back into ice (doesn't grasp reversibility).",
    "- The student fails to include or incorrectly labels the processes of heating and cooling (student doesnâ€™t understand the terms).",
    "- The student cannot connect their drawing to the concept that some changes can be reversed and some cannot (lacks understanding of reversibility)."
