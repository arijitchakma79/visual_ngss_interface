  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a block of ice. I know ice is solid, so I think I'll make it like a square or maybe a rectangle. It should be just a simple shape. I'm not sure how to show that it's melting, so I'll just draw the ice and maybe some lines that look like they're going down to show it turning into water. Can I do that? I think water should look the same because I'm not sure how they are different, but I know ice is cold and hard. I don't remember how to show it turning back into ice, so I might just leave that part out. I think I should label my drawing, but I'm not sure what to write, so I'll just leave it blank or write 'ice' if I remember. I remember seeing an ice cube once, so I'll make it look like that as much as I can.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing featuring a basic, light blue square representing a block of ice. The ice is on the left side of the paper. Some wavy, downward pencil lines under the block of ice suggest melting water, but it lacks clarity. The right side of the paper is mostly empty, or shows another square similar to the first, possibly labeled 'ice'. There are no clear depictions of liquid water or the transition process. The drawing is done with a pencil and blue crayon, with no intricate details. Labels are either missing or incorrect, showcasing a beginning level of understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately depicts what the student can do, such as drawing a basic shape for ice, but lacks the transition details and differentiation between states, which the student struggles with. The absence of correct labels and depiction of reversibility aligns with the student's minimal understanding, as described in ‘cannot’ scenarios."
