  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before it is heated, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can illustrate the heating process that causes the ice to melt into water.",
    "The student can demonstrate through their drawing that melted water can be cooled and freeze back into ice, showing the reversible change.",
    "The student can depict the characteristics of the material in both solid and liquid states.",
    "The student can include evidence in their drawing of how cooling the liquid water results in solid ice, emphasizing the reversibility of the change.",
    "The student can clearly label the drawings to show the stages of change and reversal, connecting their drawing to cause and effect."
