  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a block of ice, representing the solid state, but with very basic features (e.g., a simple square or rectangle)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to illustrate the process of heating causing the ice to melt into water (student does not depict the transition or uses unrelated imagery).",
    "The student cannot demonstrate how melted water can freeze back into ice, showing the reversible change (student may not understand the concept of reversibility).",
    "The student cannot clearly depict the characteristics of the material in both solid and liquid states (drawings of water and ice might be the same or indistinguishable).",
    "The student is unlikely to include any evidence in their drawing of how cooling results in the formation of solid ice (may not show freezing at all).",
    "The student cannot clearly label the drawings to show the stages of change and reversal, connecting their drawing to cause and effect (labels may be absent or incorrect)."
