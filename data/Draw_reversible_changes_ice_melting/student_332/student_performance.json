  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the material before heating, such as a solid piece of ice.",
    "The student can clearly illustrate the change after heating, accurately showing how the ice becomes liquid water.",
    "The student can effectively depict the change when heating is reversed, showing liquid water freezing back into solid ice.",
    "The student can include detailed labels or notes that explain the changes as reversible, indicating that water can freeze back into ice.",
    "The student can represent the idea that not all changes caused by heating or cooling are reversible by contrasting with another example, like a cooked egg that cannot go back to being raw."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally have incomplete or slightly unclear labels on their drawing (e.g., shorter or less descriptive labels than expected)."
