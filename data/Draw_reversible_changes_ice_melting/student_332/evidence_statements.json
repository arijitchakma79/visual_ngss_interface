  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, such as a solid piece of ice.",
    "The student can illustrate the change after heating, showing how ice becomes liquid water.",
    "The student can depict the change when heating is reversed, such as liquid water freezing back into solid ice.",
    "The student can include labels or notes that explain whether the changes are reversible, for example, indicating that water can freeze back into ice.",
    "The student can represent the idea that not all changes caused by heating or cooling are reversible by contrasting another example, like a cooked egg that cannot go back to being raw."
