  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material in its original state before heating or cooling (e.g., show ice before it starts melting).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating (e.g., ice turning into water).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens when the heating process is reversed (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can include simple labels or short descriptions to show the reversible change (e.g., \"ice\", \"water\") or use arrows to indicate changes.",
    "The student can show that some changes are not reversible by comparing them with reversible changes (e.g., contrast with a cooked egg)."
