  "Reasoning": "Okay, so I need to draw how ice melts and changes into water. First, I’ll draw a chunk of ice. I remember that ice is solid, cold, and sort of square; maybe I’ll make it blue. I think I’ll label it ‘ice’ so it’s clear. Next, I'll draw how the ice becomes water, which means I should draw something that looks like water dripping. I'll use arrows to show that the ice becomes water, but I might just use one arrow and not be too detailed. I’ll keep it simple and label it ‘water’. Oh, I know I need to show changes, but I'm not so sure about drawing how water turns back into ice, and I might mix that up. I should probably leave that out so I don’t confuse myself. I’ve heard of other changes like cooking an egg, but I’m not quite sure how to draw that to show it’s not reversible, so I’ll leave that out too.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, cartoon-style depiction of reversible change. Start with a blue ice cube labeled 'ice', with an arrow pointing to a puddle of water labeled 'water'. Use simple lines and minimalistic detail. The colors should be light blue for the ice and clear or light gray for the water. Ensure there's an arrow but without detailed labeling on the process. The style should be childlike, with simple and clear imagery.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by having them draw ice turning into water, using basic elements like an ice cube and a lake with simple labels. It reflects their struggle by not including the reverse process of turning water back into ice and avoids depicting non-reversible changes like a cooked egg. The labels are minimal, and an arrow is used inconsistently, aligning with the student’s developing level of understanding."
