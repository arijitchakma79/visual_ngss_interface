  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of ice before it is heated (e.g., solid form of water, cold to touch).",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of water after ice is heated (e.g., liquid form, water that is no longer solid).",
    "The student can illustrate the process of reversing by cooling, where water freezes back into ice (e.g., water turning back into a solid form).",
    "The student can use their drawings to explain that melting ice into water is a reversible change, as the water can be turned back into ice.",
    "The student can represent the cause (heating or cooling) and effect (change in state) in their drawings, showing understanding of how these changes can generate observable patterns."
