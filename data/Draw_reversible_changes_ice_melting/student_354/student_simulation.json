  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw how ice melts, and how it's a reversible change. First, I'll start by drawing a cube and calling it 'ice'. That should show the ice in its solid form. Now, I need to show it melting into water. I'll draw some wavy lines underneath the cube to represent water. Maybe I'll add an arrow pointing downwards from the ice to the water to show melting. Okay, I've got that, but I'm not sure how to show the water turning back into ice. I think I'll leave it as it is, focusing on the melting part. I'll add some labels but might mix some of them up. Let's see, this melted water might look like ice, but it's really water, so I'll just label it 'water'. I'm not exactly sure how to do the heating and cooling parts properly, so I think I'll skip those arrows.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple diagram showing an ice cube labeled 'ice' with wavy lines beneath it to represent water. Include a downward arrow from the ice to the water to indicate melting. Labels should be basic, and the diagram should focus primarily on the melting process. Use simple colors like blue for water and light blue for ice, in a child-like, straightforward drawing style.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing the ice melting into water with simple labels and arrows indicating change. It reflects what the student cannot do by not including the refreezing process, omitting cause-and-effect relationships like heating and cooling, and using basic labels without technical terms. The focus is on a one-way change (melting), which aligns with their emerging understanding."
