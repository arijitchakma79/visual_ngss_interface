  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can depict ice in a solid form using simple shapes to represent its structure (e.g., a cube or block) and may label it 'ice'.",
    "The student can attempt to show ice melting into water by drawing water beneath or next to the ice, possibly with arrows to indicate change.",
    "The student might illustrate water in liquid form using wavy lines or droplets, showing that it is different from the ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not consistently represent the process of refreezing correctly or may omit it entirely (e.g., showing only melting but not solidification).",
    "The student might not clearly indicate cause and effect, such as heating leading to melting and cooling lead to freezing (e.g., arrows or symbols may be missing or incorrectly placed).",
    "The student is unlikely to use technical terms or detailed labels consistently, such as 'liquid' or 'solid', or may confuse them (e.g., labeling water as 'ice').",
    "The student may fail to illustrate that the process is reversible, not showing water turning back into ice (e.g., depicting only one directional change)."
