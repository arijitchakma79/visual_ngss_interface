  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw ice in its solid state with clear labels indicating it is ice before heating.",
    "The student can illustrate the melting process, showing ice turning into water with arrows or motion lines to indicate melting.",
    "The student can clearly depict the change from solid ice to liquid water, with an understanding of the transition.",
    "The student can represent the cooling process, showing water reverting back to ice, possibly with labels or symbols for cooling.",
    "The student can use visual cues or labels to differentiate between reversible changes, such as melting/freezing, and irreversible changes.",
    "The student can include comprehensive explanations or labels describing the heating and cooling processes, noting that these changes are reversible."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label every stage, such as forgetting to label the middle stage of water as liquid.",
    "The student may omit minor details like the temperature at which melting or freezing occurs, though this does not hinder their overall understanding."
