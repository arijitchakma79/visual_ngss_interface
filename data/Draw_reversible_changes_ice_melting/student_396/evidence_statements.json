  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (like ice or chocolate) before it is heated, showing its original state.",
    "The student can illustrate the material during the heating process, indicating changes such as melting.",
    "The student can depict the material once it has been fully heated, showing the new form (e.g., from ice to liquid water).",
    "The student can represent the cooling process, showing how the heated material changes back to its original state, if reversible.",
    "The student can differentiate between changes that are reversible and those that are not by using visual cues or labels in their drawing.",
    "The student can include explanations or labels that describe the process of heating and cooling and note whether each change is reversible."
