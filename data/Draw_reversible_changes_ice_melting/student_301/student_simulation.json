  "Reasoning": "I want to draw how ice changes. First, I'll draw a blue block to show the ice. I know ice melts into water, so I’ll attempt drawing some water as a small puddle beside or under the ice block. The puddle can be round and colored light blue. I don't remember how to show the ice turning into water. Maybe if I draw a sun above, that will help show that the ice melts in the heat. I won't draw arrows or labels because I'm not sure what to say. The idea of ice becoming water and then freezing back into ice confuses me, so I won't draw that part. I’ll just show the ice melting because I know that happens when it’s warm.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing of a large blue block on the left side, representing an ice cube. Next to it, a small light blue puddle on the ground shows the ice has started melting. Above the block of ice, a simple yellow sun is depicted, without any lines or arrows. The style is basic with minimal detail, showing the effort of a young student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt represents the student's understanding and abilities: they can draw basic shapes and colors to represent ice and water but struggle to show the process and transition between states. There are no arrows or labels indicating understanding of cause and effect or reversibility, which aligns with what the student cannot do."
