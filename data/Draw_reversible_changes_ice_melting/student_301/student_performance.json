  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "Might be able to show a simple block shape representing ice, but lacks detail or context.",
    "Might attempt to draw water in some form, potentially as a puddle or simple shape without showing transition."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Unable to represent the transition from solid ice to liquid water through heating properly (lacks arrows or labels).",
    "Cannot show the process of liquid water cooling and refreezing back into solid ice (student doesnâ€™t know this or gets confused by the concept).",
    "Fails to use cause and effect to illustrate that heating and cooling lead to state changes (e.g., might draw the sun but not connect it to the melting).",
    "Does not annotate or label which changes are reversible (does not understand the concept of reversibility)."
