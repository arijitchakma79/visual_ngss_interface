  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of ice before it is heated, showing its solid form.",
    "The student can depict the ice melting process, demonstrating the transition from solid ice to liquid water through heating.",
    "The student can represent the reversal of this process by showing how liquid water can be cooled and refreeze back into solid ice.",
    "The student can include labels or annotations to indicate which changes can and cannot be reversed, using examples such as water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can use cause and effect to show that heating and cooling cause observable changes in the state of the material.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding that while some changes are reversible, not all heating or cooling changes can be reversed."
