  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a rectangle to show the ice. I'm starting with a shape that looks like a block. Ice is solid, I know that. But I'm not very sure how to show it melting into water. I think maybe I should draw some wavy lines under the block to represent water, but I’m not confident that shows the change really well. I remember hearing that ice becomes water when it heats up, but I’ll skip labeling it because I'm not sure what to call it when it melts or freezes. I don’t know how to show the water turning back to ice, or to explain that this can happen. I think maybe all changes can just be reversed, but I'm not certain. I won't add any notes because I'm not sure what to write.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing on paper showing a rectangle intended to resemble a block of ice. Below the rectangle, there are wavy lines attempting to represent melted water. The drawing does not include any labels. The entire drawing is done in pencil, and it is simplistic, without any details indicating a clear transition from solid to liquid, and no depiction of the liquid turning back into solid. The style is minimalistic, reflecting a beginner's understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's ability and struggles because it describes a minimalistic drawing: a basic shape for the ice and a simple attempt to show it melting, without any clear transition or labels. This reflects the student's initial understanding and their difficulty in illustrating and labeling transitions between states or in providing explanatory notes, as described in what the student can and cannot do."
