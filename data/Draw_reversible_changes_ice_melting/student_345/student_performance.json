  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may be able to draw a basic shape that loosely resembles ice but without clear details distinguishing it as a solid (e.g., simple block shape)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student does not illustrate the change of the material after it is heated (e.g., student shows ice but not the melted water or does not show a distinct transition).",
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate the change of the material after it is cooled again (e.g., fails to show water refreezing into ice).",
    "The student does not label the illustration or uses incorrect labels for heating and cooling processes (e.g., labels 'ice' as 'water' with no differentiation).",
    "The student does not add notes indicating which changes are reversible and why (e.g., no text or incorrect explanation like 'once ice melts, it cannot be ice again').",
    "The student does not show an understanding that some changes cannot be reversed (e.g., might incorrectly suggest any change can be reversed by cooling or heating)."
