  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state (e.g., ice as a solid).",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after it is heated (e.g., showing ice melting into water).",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after it is cooled again (e.g., showing water refreezing into ice).",
    "The student can label each part of the illustration to show the processes of heating and cooling.",
    "The student can add notes to the illustration to indicate which changes are reversible (e.g., ice to water and back to ice) and explain why they are considered reversible.",
    "The student can show an understanding that some changes, unlike the reversible melting of ice, cannot be undone by cooling or heating."
