  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the changes that occur when the material is heated (e.g., ice melting to water).",
    "The student can depict the reversal of this change when the material is cooled again (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can use arrows or labels to show which changes are reversible by heating or cooling.",
    "The student can identify one change that cannot be reversed, using a different material (e.g., a cooked egg) and explain in their drawing why it cannot change back."
