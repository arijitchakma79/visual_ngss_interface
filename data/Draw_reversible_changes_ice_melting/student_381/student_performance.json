  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice before heating, but it may not clearly show characteristics related to cold or solid state. (e.g., a simple blank square labeled as ice)",
    "The student can include some kind of transformation indication, like water dripping off the ice, without clear arrows or explanation."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unable to accurately show water resulting from melted ice. (e.g., melted state is not represented or misunderstood as a solid water puddle)",
    "The student does not illustrate the reversal of change, as they might believe the process to be one-way or irreversible. (e.g., no depiction of water turning back to ice)",
    "The student cannot use arrows or labels to denote changes being reversible due to misunderstanding how heating and cooling work. (e.g., arrows might point in incorrect directions)",
    "The student likely shows a misunderstanding of irreversible changes. (e.g., drawing a scrambled egg and indicating it can be reversed back to raw egg because of the same process of cooling)"
