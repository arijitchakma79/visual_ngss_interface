  "Reasoning": "I’m going to draw how ice melts into water and then freezes back into ice. First, I’ll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember I need to label it, so I'll write 'ice' next to it. Now, I’ll draw an arrow pointing from the ice to a puddle of water. I need to show that heat is making this change happen, so I’ll add a little sun or maybe wavy lines to show it’s hot. I sometimes forget to label, but I’ll try to remember to write 'water' next to the puddle. Now, to show the water turning back into ice, I'll draw another arrow from the water back to a new block of ice. I'll try to show cold somehow, maybe with a snowflake or an ice cube symbol. I know I can sometimes forget to label either 'ice' or 'water,' so I’ll double-check that. I also need to make sure to label the arrows if I can remember, but that’s tricky for me sometimes.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple diagram on a white background depicting reversible changes. Start with an ice cube on the left, labeled 'ice,' with wavy heat lines or a sun overhead. Draw an arrow pointing right from the ice cube to a puddle labeled 'water.' Include a symbol for heat like a small sun near the first arrow. Next, draw an arrow back from the water to a second ice cube, with a snowflake or cool lines above to show cooling. The second ice cube should also be labeled 'ice.' Use basic colors like blue for the ice and water, and yellow or orange for the heat symbols. The style should be clear and straightforward, like a student’s notebook sketch.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to depict the reversible change from ice to water and back into ice with basic labels. The drawing captures the substances involved and attempts to demonstrate the process through symbols and arrows. The student is proficient but might omit or inconsistently label either 'ice' or 'water,' which is accounted for by explicitly stating them in the prompt. Including symbols like a sun or snowflake helps address the heat and cooling processes visually, even if not labeled with words."
