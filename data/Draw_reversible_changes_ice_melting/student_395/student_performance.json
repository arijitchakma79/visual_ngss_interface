  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can create a drawing that shows how ice changes into water when heated.",
    "The student can illustrate that water can change back into ice when cooled.",
    "The student can label the materials before and after heating or cooling (e.g., label 'ice' before heating and 'water' after).",
    "The student can depict the reversible nature of ice melting and refreezing into ice, showing both stages.",
    "The student can use arrows or other symbols to indicate the process of change and reversal."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label either 'ice' or 'water,' possibly omitting a label on one side (labeling gaps).",
    "The student might draw an arrow between stages but not clearly specify the heating or cooling process next to the arrows (missing process details)."
