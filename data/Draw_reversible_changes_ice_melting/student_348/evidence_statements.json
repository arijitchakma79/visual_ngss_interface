  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the initial state of the material before heating or cooling, such as ice before melting.",
    "The student can show the changes to the material after heating, like ice melting into water.",
    "The student can depict the reversible process by illustrating water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can identify and represent whether the observed change (ice to water) is reversible through their drawing.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of cause and effect by showing the sequence of heating and cooling processes in their illustrations."
