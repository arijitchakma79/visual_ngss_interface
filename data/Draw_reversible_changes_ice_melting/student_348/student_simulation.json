  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing some ice cubes in a straightforward way because I can clearly see those in my mind. I know it’s important to show them as 'solid,' so I'll label them, but I might forget to. I remember ice melts with warmth, so I’ll sketch the sun with rays pointing toward the ice, but getting the sun’s look just right is tough, so it might look a bit off. Next, I’ll show the process of the ice melting by drawing droplets and a small water pool around the ice cubes. Now I should illustrate that the process is reversible, so I'll draw the water turning back into ice inside a freezer. To convey the freezing process, I'll use arrows to show water going into a cold environment. I want to label 'liquid' and 'solid' states somewhere, but I might not finish that part. My drawing will have all the elements, although the proportions and details might be a bit inconsistent.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn scene showing the reversible process of ice melting and refreezing. On the left side, there are clear depictions of ice cubes with droplets and a small water pool. Above, a partially drawn sun is delivering rays of warmth onto the ice. On the right, a depiction of a freezer is shown with arrows leading into it, indicating water turning back into ice cubes. The drawing includes some handlabelled words, possibly 'solid' and 'liquid,' but might appear incomplete. The style is colorful but slightly amateurish with occasional proportions being uneven.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt includes the ability to show ice turning into water and back to ice comprehensively, capturing the reversible cycle the student understands well. The partially drawn elements like an incomplete sun reflect minor artistic inconsistencies. While the student aims to label temperature or states clearly, gaps in these labels are mentioned, accurately reflecting the 'CANNOT' aspects."
