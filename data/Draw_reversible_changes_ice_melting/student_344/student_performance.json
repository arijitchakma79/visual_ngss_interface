  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draws a clear and detailed depiction of ice before heating, emphasizing its solid state characteristics.",
    "Illustrates the transformation of ice melting into water, accurately showing the liquid state after heating.",
    "Demonstrates the reversible change by depicting water freezing back into ice, highlighting the solid state again.",
    "Uses clear labels and notes to indicate that each change is reversible, ensuring each phase is well-annotated.",
    "Visually represents that the changes due to heating or cooling can be reversed with clarity and accuracy, such as using consistent arrows or symbols."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "May occasionally omit a label, but this is rare and likely due to oversight rather than misunderstanding of the concept."
