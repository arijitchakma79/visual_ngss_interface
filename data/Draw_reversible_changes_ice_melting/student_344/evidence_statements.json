  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before any heating or cooling, showing its characteristics (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing the change (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can demonstrate the change is reversible by drawing the material after cooling again (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can indicate whether each change they draw is reversible, using labels or notes in their drawing.",
    "The student can visually represent the idea that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed, while others cannot."
