  "Reasoning": "I know I'm supposed to draw something about ice melting. Ice is cold, and I've seen it as blocks, like in the freezer. I'll start with drawing a square, 'cause that's how I remember ice looking. I don't remember how it melts exactly, but I think melted ice is kind of like water. Water looks wavy, so I'll add a wavy line next to the ice. I heard something about 'reversible changes', but I'm not sure what that means. I just drew the ice and water separately because that's what they look like.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing by a young student showing a large blocky ice cube on one side and a wavy line representing water on the other side. The style is crayon-like, with simple lines and basic colors: blue for the ice cube and light blue for the water. The background is plain white, emphasizing the objects.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do, which is drawing a separate image of either an ice cube or water, but not illustrating the change process or labeling the drawing. The simplicity of the blocky ice and wavy water matches the student's level of understanding, where they don't grasp the concept of change or reversibility."
