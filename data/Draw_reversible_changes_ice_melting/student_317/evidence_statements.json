    "The student can draw a picture showing ice melting into water to represent a reversible change caused by heating.",
    "The student can illustrate the water being cooled and turning back into ice to show the reversible nature of the change.",
    "The student can include labels that describe the characteristics of the ice and water before and after the change.",
    "The student can show the sequence or steps that highlight the cause and effect of the heating and cooling process.",
    "The student can add a written explanation or label that connects their drawing to the idea that some changes are reversible and explain why ice melting is a reversible change."
