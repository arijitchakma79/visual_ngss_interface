  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw a shape representing ice but with no clear distinction that it's a solid (e.g., a basic square shape).",
    "The student might show some form of liquid, such as a puddle, representing water, but without connecting it to the ice melting process (e.g., drawing water but not associating it with melted ice)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate the transition from ice to water (e.g., no arrows or indicators of change).",
    "The student does not show or understand the concept of reversible change (e.g., no depiction of water turning back into ice).",
    "The student may not label the states or changes correctly (e.g., missing or incorrect labels such as 'hot' instead of 'melting').",
    "The student is unable to depict the cyclical nature of the changes (e.g., might omit the reverse process or show random change paths)."
