  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, capturing the change (e.g., ice melts into liquid water).",
    "The student can illustrate the material when the heating is reversed, showing the final state (e.g., liquid water becomes solid ice again).",
    "The student can label the drawings to describe what is happening during the changes (e.g., melting, freezing).",
    "The student can depict which changes are reversible by showing the cycle of changes (e.g., ice to water to ice)."
