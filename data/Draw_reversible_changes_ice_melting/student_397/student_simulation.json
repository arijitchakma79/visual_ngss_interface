  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw how ice melts. I remember ice is like a block, so I'll draw a square. It’s just a simple shape, maybe using blue because ice is cold. Now, for the water... I know water is a liquid, and sometimes it looks like a puddle. So I'll draw a roundish shape next to the ice, but I think I'll make it blue too because water is the same color. Oh, maybe a little different blue. Hmm, I’m not sure how to show that the ice becomes the water, so I guess I'll just leave it like that without arrows or anything. And, what about labels? I'll write 'ice' for the square and 'water' for the puddle. I know there's something with changing back to ice, but I really don’t get that, so I won’t draw anything else.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a blue square labeled 'ice' to represent ice. Next to it, a roundish blue puddle labeled 'water' to represent water. The background is plain white, and the drawing style is very basic, using simple shapes and minimal detail, like a child's drawing.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can and cannot do. The student attempts to represent ice with a simple shape and color but does not accurately show the transition process. They depict water separately but do not show it as melted ice or connect the two with arrows or indicators. Labels are minimal and somewhat correct, as they might only label the basic representations (ice and water), missing any concept of reversible change."
