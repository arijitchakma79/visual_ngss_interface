  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing how it looks (e.g., a block of ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, showing the change (e.g., the ice becomes water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, showing how the reversible change brings it back to the original state (e.g., water turns back into ice).",
    "The student can use arrows or labels to show the process of heating and cooling.",
    "The student can include simple explanations or labels to show that some changes can be reversed and others cannot."
