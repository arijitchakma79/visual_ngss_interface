  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a block of ice before heating, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can draw the transition of ice melting into water after heating, illustrating the change.",
    "The student can draw the water freezing back into ice after cooling, indicating the reversible process.",
    "The student can use arrows to represent the process of heating and cooling, indicating the direction of change.",
    "The student includes simple labels to indicate melting and freezing processes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not consistently use arrows to show direction (e.g., sometimes forgetting or placing them incorrectly).",
    "The student may not clearly explain that some changes are reversible, while others are not (e.g., not labeling 'reversible' beside the transitions).",
    "Minor inconsistencies in labeling steps or missing some intermediate steps in the process (e.g., not labeling water as 'liquid')."
