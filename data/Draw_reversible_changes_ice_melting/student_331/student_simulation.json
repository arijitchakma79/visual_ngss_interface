  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of ice. I remember ice is a solid, so I'll make it look like a cube. Next, I'll show the ice melting. I think I'll draw some arrows pointing downwards to show the change, like it's melting into a puddle. I'll add a label here saying 'melting'. Now, I'll draw the water that was the ice, showing it as a wavy puddle. I think I should label this 'liquid', but sometimes I forget to do that. Now, I'll draw another arrow, pointing from the water upwards where I'll redraw the ice cube, showing that it can freeze back. I should label this 'freezing' to show itâ€™s reversible. I remember that it helps to add another arrow showing cooling, but sometimes I place the arrows wrong. I'll label the transition 'reversible', but I might miss labeling every stage, like sometimes leaving 'liquid' off. Finally, I'll use some color - blue for the ice and water, to make it clear. I hope this shows the reversible change clearly.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing depicting the reversible changes of melting and freezing of ice. On the left, there is a blue cube representing a block of ice in its solid state. Arrows point downward to a wavy blue shape labeled 'melting' indicating the transition to water. Next to the water, arrows pointing upwards indicate the process of freezing the water back to ice, labeled 'freezing'. Some arrows are not perfectly aligned and might be missing in some transitions, showing minor inconsistencies in directions. Simple labels indicate 'melting' and 'freezing', but not all elements like 'liquid' are labeled consistently. The drawing shows a clear ice cube, water in the middle, and another ice cube on the right, with an overall simple and child-like drawing style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do according to their proficiency level: accurately drawing the ice and showing its transformation to water and back, using colors, and including labels for melting and freezing. It also captures the student's struggles, such as potential missing labels and inconsistent arrow usage, accurately representing the minor misunderstandings at their proficiency level."
