  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big, blue cube to represent ice. I remember that ice is solid and cold. Then, I'll try to show what happens when the ice melts. I'll draw an arrow pointing from the ice cube to a puddle of water. The water will be blue too but maybe a little more wavy to show it's liquid. I need to remember to use an arrow to show the change, but sometimes I forget which way it goes. Oh, and I'm supposed to show that this is reversible, but I'm not sure how to draw water turning back into ice. I might just leave it because I'm not sure how to show everything reversing correctly. It’s hard to write about why ice melts, so I might not include that.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing of a big, blue ice cube on the left, with an arrow pointing to the right, leading to a small puddle of wavy blue water. The entire drawing should be basic and colorful, using large, clear shapes. The background should be plain white, and the image should have a drawn style similar to colored pencils or crayons, showing an elementary school skill level.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches the student's abilities because it includes basic elements like the ice cube and water puddle, which the student can draw. It features an arrow to indicate a change, but doesn’t include a reversal process since the student struggles with that aspect. The simple style reflects the student's developing skills at this level, and the omission of detailed labels and explanations aligns with the student's challenges in fully explaining reversibility and cause-and-effect."
