  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its original state.",
    "The student can attempt to draw the material after heating, illustrating the change (e.g., ice becomes water).",
    "The student might use a simple arrow to indicate change from ice to water, although this may lack detail."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may struggle to correctly depict the reversal process clearly, such as showing water turning back into ice.",
    "The student might not correctly illustrate and label the changes as reversible with accurate details and explanations.",
    "The student can forget or incorrectly use cause and effect labels, such as failing to denote why ice melts when heated.",
    "(The student often omits steps or stages, lacking a complete sequence from solid to liquid to solid again.)",
    "The student may confuse the direction of arrows or sequence, leading to a misrepresentation of the process."
