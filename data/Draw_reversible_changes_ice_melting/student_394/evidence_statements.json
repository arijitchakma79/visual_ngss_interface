  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its original state.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, illustrating the change (e.g., ice becomes water).",
    "The student can draw the process of reversing the change by cooling (e.g., water being cooled back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate and label which changes are reversible and which are not (e.g., water can become ice again, but a cooked egg cannot become raw again).",
    "The student can use arrows or sequences to show the change and reversal in the material due to heating and cooling.",
    "The student can include cause and effect labels to show why the change happens and how it is reversed."
