  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a basic shape that might represent ice without clear details (e.g., a simple block, but it lacks characteristic features such as sharp edges or transparency)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot clearly illustrate the transition from ice to water or water to ice with appropriate changes in characteristics (e.g., drawings of ice and water look the same).",
    "The student is unable to accurately represent the process of the water freezing back into ice (e.g., ice reappears by magic rather than through cooling).",
    "The student cannot effectively show that changes are reversible through the drawings (e.g., arrows or annotations showing directionality are missing or incorrect).",
    "The student likely misunderstands the concept of irreversible changes and might draw examples incorrectly or not at all (e.g., a cooked egg turning back into a raw egg)."
