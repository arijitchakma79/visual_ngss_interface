  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a big block for the ice. I remember ice is solid, but I'm not sure how to show that it's freezing or melting. I'll make a simple box shape to be my ice. I know water is liquid, but when I try to draw the difference, I just end up drawing a box that looks the same. I can't really show ice turning into water or water turning back into ice with my drawing. I also can’t figure out how to draw arrows to show it changes back and forth, and I mix up changes that can't be reversed. Like, I remember something about eggs not going back to raw if cooked, but it’s confusing when I try to draw it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple block shape in light blue without sharp edges to represent ice. Next to it, draw another block shape in light blue, identical to the first, to represent water, failing to show a distinct difference between them. Avoid using arrows or annotations. Color the background light gray to emulate a classroom setting. The drawing style should be basic and childlike, as if sketched by an elementary school student.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt reflects what the student can do by showing a simple block shape for ice, representing their minimal ability to depict ice. The lack of detailed distinction, arrows, and annotations illustrates the student's inability to show changes between solid and liquid, align with reversible changes, and confusion with irreversible changes. The use of a childlike drawing style matches the student's beginning level of understanding."
