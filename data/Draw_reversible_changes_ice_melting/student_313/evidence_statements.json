  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can draw the material after being heated (e.g., ice melting into water), showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling back down (e.g., water freezing back into ice), showing its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate a reversible change by showing the material returning to its original state after cooling (e.g., water becomes ice again).",
    "The student can use their drawings to support the claim that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed.",
    "The student can identify and illustrate a change that is not reversible (e.g., cooked egg staying solid) if asked."
