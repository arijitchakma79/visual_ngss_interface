  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can depict ice as a solid shape before heating, like a block or cube.",
    "The student can illustrate water as a liquid state after heating with wavy lines or water droplets.",
    "The student can show the water cooling and freezing back into ice with a similar solid structure as before.",
    "The student can label the drawing to indicate that the change from ice to water and back to ice is reversible.",
    "The student can describe the changes depicted and identify the process as moving between solid and liquid states."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might miss labeling all parts of the process, such as missing a label for 'heating' or 'cooling' arrows (student forgets to include arrows or labels).",
    "The student may occasionally omit details like the specific temperature changes involved (student assumes labels are enough)."
