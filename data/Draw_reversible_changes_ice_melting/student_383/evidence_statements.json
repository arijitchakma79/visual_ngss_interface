  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can depict the change in a material, such as ice turning into water when heated.",
    "The student can show that the material can change back, such as water turning into ice when cooled.",
    "The student can illustrate the material's state before heating or cooling (e.g., ice as solid).",
    "The student can illustrate the material's state after heating (e.g., water as liquid).",
    "The student can illustrate the material's state after cooling (e.g., water returning to ice, solid again).",
    "The student can label the drawing to indicate whether the change is reversible or not (e.g., ice to water to ice as reversible).",
    "The student can describe changes depicted, showing a clear reversal process for the materials that can change back."
