  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I know ice is a solid, so Iâ€™ll draw it as a cube shape to show it's hard and blocky. Next, I need to show what happens when the ice melts. I remember that when ice melts, it turns into water, which is a liquid. I'll draw wavy lines coming off the ice to show it's turning into water, and maybe some droplets. I should add an arrow to represent heating, but sometimes I forget this part. Then I'll draw what happens when the water freezes back into ice. I'll draw another cube, similar to the first one, because the water turns solid again. I know it's important to label the states. I'll label the first cube 'Ice - Solid,' and the water 'Water - Liquid', and the second cube 'Ice - Solid' again to show the reversibility. I should add labels for 'heating' and 'cooling', but sometimes I forget where exactly to put them, especially the arrows. I tend to think the state labels are enough to show what's happening.",
  "Prompt": "A pencil drawing showing three stages of a reversible change involving ice and water. First image: A blue, cubic block labeled 'Ice - Solid'. Second image: Wavy blue water lines labeled 'Water - Liquid', with water droplets around it. Third image: Another blue, cubic block labeled 'Ice - Solid'. Arrows above the scenes indicating 'heating' and 'cooling', but one arrow might not be labeled. Simple, clear labeling.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: depicting ice as a solid, water as a liquid, and returning to ice, with appropriate labels on each state. It also highlights what the student struggles with, such as the potential omission of an arrow or inconsistent labeling of heating and cooling. The drawing style and details reflect a proficient but not flawless execution, suitable for a student at a Level 3 proficiency."
