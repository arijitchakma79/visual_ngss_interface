  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing its initial state (e.g., a solid piece of ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, illustrating the change (e.g., the ice has melted into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling again, demonstrating if the change is reversible (e.g., the water is frozen back into ice).",
    "The student can use drawings to show changes that cannot be reversed by heating or cooling (e.g., cooked egg remains solid).",
    "The student can include labels or notes in the drawing to explain if the change is reversible or irreversible and what process (heating or cooling) was involved."
