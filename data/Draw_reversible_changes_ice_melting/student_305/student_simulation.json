  "Reasoning": "I'll draw something that shows ice melting, even though I'm not completely sure how it looks when it changes. First, I think I need to draw ice. Ice is a solid, so I'll draw a big block. I remember that ice is clear, but for my drawing, maybe I'll draw a square and call it ice. I should put an arrow next to it because arrows mean something is changing. But I’m not sure how to show that it's melting into water. Water should probably be blue, so maybe I’ll draw a circle or a blob that's blue and put it near the block. I'll label it as 'ice' and the blob 'water.' But I'm a little confused because I think ice should look like water too. For the arrow, should it point to the water? I'm not sure, but I'll put it there anyway. I think everything freezes back into ice if it gets cold, but I mix up these things. Should I also draw something turning into ice again? I'm not sure how to do that, so I’ll leave it like it is.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of a large square labeled 'ice' and a blue circle labeled 'water'. An arrow pointing from the square to the circle. The labels might be incorrect or missing details. The drawing is child-like, with basic shapes and little detail, created using colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw a basic solid shape that might represent ice, as well as an attempt to show change by using an arrow. However, it does not accurately depict the melting process or the transformation into liquid water, consistent with the student's level of confusion about reversible changes. The labels might be missing or incorrect, indicating misunderstanding about the state changes and reversibility."
