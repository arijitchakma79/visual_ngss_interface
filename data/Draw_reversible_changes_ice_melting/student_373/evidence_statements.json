  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can create a drawing that shows a material before it is heated or cooled, highlighting its initial characteristics (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it has been heated, showing any changes observed (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can include a drawing of the material after it has cooled again, if the change is reversible, depicting any further changes (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can label which changes in their drawings are reversible (e.g., water can freeze back into ice) and which are not, if applicable.",
    "The student can use their drawing to make a claim about whether the change they depicted is reversible, using evidence from their drawings (e.g., ice melts to water and can freeze back to ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of cause and effect by showing that heating leads to melting and cooling leads to freezing when reversible changes occur in their drawings."
