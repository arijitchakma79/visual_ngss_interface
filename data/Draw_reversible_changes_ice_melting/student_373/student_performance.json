  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw a simple picture of ice in a basic form, such as a rectangle or cube shape, indicating some recognition that ice is related to the topic.",
    "The student can show a separate drawing (possibly unrelated or minimally related) that includes water, suggesting an association with the melting process but without clear connections."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to depict a sequence showing changes from ice to water and back to ice, misunderstanding the reversible nature of the process (e.g., only draws ice and water without progression).",
    "The student may not use or may incorrectly use arrows or labels to indicate changes due to heating or cooling (e.g., arrows pointing in no discernible order).",
    "The student is likely unable to make a claim about reversibility based on their drawing, lacking understanding of how heating and cooling affect the material state (e.g., thinks melting is permanent).",
    "The student may show misconceptions about cause and effect, such as both melting and freezing occurring simultaneously or unrelated to temperature changes."
