  "Reasoning": "Let's see, I'm supposed to draw something about ice melting. Okay, first, I'll draw an ice cube. Ice cubes are usually square or rectangle-shaped, so I’ll draw a rectangle shape for the ice. Next, I think water should be there, too, since ice turns into water. I'll draw a wavy shape next to the ice; it looks like a puddle. But I'm not sure how these changes really happen, like how ice becomes water and what makes it go back to ice. I remember seeing arrows in science but I'm not sure how they work here, so I'll skip them. And I don't think anything happens to make melted ice go back to its original shape. I don’t really know what else to add, so I’ll just have my ice cube and some water next to it. I hope that's okay.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of a simple ice melting concept. The drawing includes a large, basic rectangle to represent an ice cube and a wavy line next to it to signify a puddle of water. The ice is a light blue color, and the water is a lighter blue. There are no arrows or labels, indicating a lack of understanding about the transition between states. The drawing is done with crayons on white paper, with no additional details or background.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by representing the ice and water in separate forms without showing a process or order of events. The student's drawing capability is aligned with a beginning level understanding, primarily using basic shapes without correctly indicating a reversible sequence. Their struggle with depicting change mechanisms or reversibility, like using arrows or labels correctly, is reflected in the drawing’s simplicity and lack of progression."
