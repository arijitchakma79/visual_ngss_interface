  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating or cooling, showing its original state.",
    "The student can draw what happens to the material after heating (e.g., ice melting into water), clearly showing the change.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material when the heating or cooling is reversed (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can use their drawing to make a claim that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed, and some cannot.",
    "The student can label their drawings to describe the characteristics of the material in each state (before, after heating, and after reversing the change).",
    "The student can illustrate at least one example of a change caused by heating or cooling that is not reversible (e.g., cooked egg, baked cookie).",
    "The student can use drawings to demonstrate understanding of cause and effect, showing how heating or cooling leads to observable changes."
