  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I'll make it light blue to show it's cold and solid. Then I'll draw an arrow pointing to a puddle of water to show the melting. The water should be clear and liquid, so I'll use light blue again but make it more transparent. Next, I'll draw an arrow going back from the water to another block of ice to show it freezing again. I'll label each stage: the first part as 'Solid Ice,' the middle as 'Liquid Water,' and the last part as 'Ice Again' to show itâ€™s reversible. I also need to remember that the changes should look reversible; the idea is that ice can turn back into water and then back to ice. However, I get a bit confused when thinking about changes that can't be undone, like cooking, so I may not add that part correctly. I should keep in mind what causes these changes, like heat making the ice melt, and I must label this part, but I might miss exactly explaining how the temperature affects the process, especially in words.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of reversible changes in watercolor style. The left side shows a solid light blue ice cube labeled 'Solid Ice'. An arrow points to the right where there's a puddle of light blue water labeled 'Liquid Water'. Another arrow points to a new ice cube on the far right labeled 'Ice Again'. Arrows are red to show direction of change. Include a general heating label near the melting process and a cooling label near the freezing process.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do, like drawing and labeling the states of water as ice melts to water and refreezes to ice with arrows indicating the process. It includes the student's struggle with reversible and irreversible concepts since no irreversible change like a cooked egg is correctly illustrated or labeled. The use of color, labeling, and process direction suits the student's ability level and understanding, showing clear steps but not detailing the impact of temperature comprehensively."
