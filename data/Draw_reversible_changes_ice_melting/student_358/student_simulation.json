  "Reasoning": "I’ll draw a picture of what happens when ice melts. First, ice is a solid, so I’ll draw a block of ice. I remember seeing ice cubes in the freezer—they’re like little squares, so I’ll sketch a square to show ice. It’s just starting to melt, and when ice melts, it turns into water. So, I'll draw some small water droplets next to the ice block, maybe a little puddle to show the melted ice. I think ice melting is reversible, but I’m not sure how to show it becoming ice again, so I might skip drawing that part. I think maybe I should stay away from drawing something like a cooked egg turning back into a liquid, because I know that’s wrong for this kind of change. That’s an irreversible change.",
  "Prompt": "A childlike drawing depicting a simple process of ice melting. There's a square block of ice, represented by a light blue cube with shaded edges for dimensionality, placed centrally on a white surface to represent a freezer or kitchen counter. Next to the cube, small blue water droplets are visible, along with a tiny puddle of water just beginning to form, illustrating melted ice. The style is basic with thick lines and primary colors, showcasing an emerging understanding of the concept.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects what the student can successfully represent: a block of ice and the initial stages of its melting into water droplets. It captures their ability to depict basic elements of the melting process. The student struggles to illustrate the complete cycle, including the concept of refreezing, and avoids incorrect representations, such as an egg turning back from a cooked state, aligning with misunderstandings about reversible versus irreversible changes."
