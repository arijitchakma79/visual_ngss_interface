  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a material before it is heated or cooled, such as ice being solid.",
    "The student can show how the material changes after heating, like ice turning into liquid water.",
    "The student can depict the material returning to its original state when the process is reversed, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can represent that some changes are reversible by showing the cycle of ice melting and refreezing.",
    "The student can use drawings to convey that not all changes are reversible, such as showing a cooked egg remaining solid after cooling."
