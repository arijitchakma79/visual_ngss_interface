  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Emerging understanding, basic elements shown",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate ice as a solid block before it starts melting.",
    "The student can show how the material begins to change after heating, such as by drawing water droplets or a small puddle representing melted ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot accurately depict the full cycle of ice melting and refreezing, as they might not show water turning back into ice (student forgets to show reversal).",
    "The student might partially or incorrectly represent irreversible changes, such as drawing a cooked egg returning to its original liquid state (misunderstanding between reversible and irreversible changes)."
