  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw how ice melts. I'll start by drawing an ice cube. I think it’s supposed to be a solid shape, maybe like a square or a box. I guess I’ll use a square to show the ice. I might also color it light blue because ice is cold and looks kind of blue. Oh, I think ice turns into water when it melts. I’ll try to draw some water next to it, but I’m not sure how it looks different from ice. Maybe I'll make some wavy lines? Hmm, I always see water in glasses, I wonder if it stays in a cube shape. I’ll make sure to show both the ice and the water in my picture, but I’m not sure how to show that they can switch back. I heard something about something freezing, but I don’t remember how to draw that. Maybe I could use some arrows, but I don’t really know where I would put them or what they mean. I’ll draw an ice cube first and then add water. I think that's it. I’m not sure how to show that the ice can become water and then change back into ice.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing of an ice cube on the left made with a basic square shape, colored light blue, showing minimal details. To the right of the ice cube, a few wavy lines suggesting 'water', also in blue. No connections, arrows, or labels to indicate changes between solid and liquid states, with both elements appearing distinct without interaction. The style is basic, like a child's drawing, using crayons and simple lines.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects what the student can do: drawing a basic ice cube using simple shapes and possibly showing an attempt at water with wavy lines. It also highlights what the student struggles with, such as showing the transition from ice to water and back, lacking arrows or labels to illustrate reversibility. The drawing style is appropriate to their beginner level, capturing their limited understanding."
