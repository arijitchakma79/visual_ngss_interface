  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting into water and then freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can depict the characteristics of ice before it is heated, such as its solid state and shape.",
    "The student can show the characteristics of water after the ice has melted, highlighting its liquid state.",
    "The student can demonstrate the reverse process of cooling, where water changes back into ice.",
    "The student can identify and label events that show the reversible nature of ice melting and freezing.",
    "The student can connect the drawing to the concept that some changes, like ice melting, are reversible, by using arrows or labels to indicate the melting and freezing processes."
