  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw an image of an ice cube with basic shapes, indicating its solid state, though may lack detail or inaccurate shapes.",
    "The student may attempt to show that ice can change into a liquid, but details or concepts are likely unclear or missing."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to accurately illustrate the complete process of freezing and melting with appropriate characteristics of each state (e.g., doesn't show ice becoming water or vice versa).",
    "The student does not clearly depict the characteristics of water after melting, such as its liquid state (e.g., water might be shown with the same shape as ice).",
    "The student cannot effectively demonstrate the reversible nature of ice melting and freezing, likely omitting arrows or labels indicating change.",
    "The student may not connect the changes to the concept of reversibility, possibly misunderstanding that ice melting can be undone (e.g., might indicate a one-way change only)."
