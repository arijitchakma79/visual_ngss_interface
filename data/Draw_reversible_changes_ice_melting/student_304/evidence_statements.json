  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., draw ice before it starts to melt).",
    "The student can depict what the material looks like after it is heated or cooled (e.g., draw water after ice has melted).",
    "The student can show how the material reverses back to its original state if possible (e.g., draw ice again after water has refrozen).",
    "The student can represent the changes in a sequence that clearly shows the cause and effect (e.g., show ice turning to water, then back to ice and label each step).",
    "The student can include labels or short notes that explain the reversibility of the changes (e.g., add a note saying 'ice melts to form water' and 'water freezes to form ice')."
