  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a simple block of ice, which looks solid and firm. I remember that ice is clear and looks a bit blueish at times. I'll make sure to color it like that. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing to the right to show the process of melting. Below this arrow, I could write 'melts to form water' so it's clear what happens next. Now, I’ll draw a pool of water just beside the ice and color it light blue as well for consistency, showing the liquid state. To show the process in reverse, I'll draw another arrow in the opposite direction, from the water back to ice, and I’ll label it 'freezes to form ice'. I should draw another block of ice to complete the cycle. I remember to include these labels but sometimes I forget one. I need to remember to label every step, even the 'becomes ice again' part because it's important. I realize the size of ice and water might not exactly match up, but I'll focus on getting the sequence right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a sequence showing reversible changes of ice melting into water and refreezing to ice. Start with a solid block of ice with a slightly blue hue. Beside it, draw an arrow pointing right with the label 'melts to form water'. Next, illustrate pooled water colored light blue. Draw another arrow pointing left labeled 'freezes to form ice'. Finally, add another block of ice at the end. Use clear labels and keep a simple, cartoonish illustration style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with the student's abilities as it requires accurate depiction of each state (ice and water), as well as the transition processes (melting and freezing), which the student can accomplish effectively. The student includes necessary labels to explain the reversibility of the changes, although they may sometimes miss one due to oversight. The description recognizes that while the sequence is clear, the sizing of ice and water may not be perfectly consistent, which matches the student's focus on representing change over proportional accuracy."
