  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can represent a material before it undergoes a change due to heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show what happens to the material when it is heated (e.g., ice turning into water).",
    "The student can depict the material after it has been cooled again (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate which changes are reversible (e.g., ice melting into water and freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate which changes are not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg not turning back into a raw egg).",
    "The student can identify the cause of the change (e.g., heating or cooling) and its effect on the material.",
    "The student can show a pattern of change and reversibility through their drawings."
