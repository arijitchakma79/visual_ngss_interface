  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a block of ice. I remember that ice is usually square, and I’ll use blue because that feels cold. Now, I need to show it turning into water. I’ll draw some water next to the ice, but making it look realistic is hard. I think I'll make it a wavy shape and color it light blue. To try and show that the water turns back into ice, I’ll put the water further away and draw another block of ice at the end. I’m supposed to show that the changes can go back and forth, so I’ll add arrows between the drawings. I’m not sure about the direction or labels though. I want to show what makes the ice melt, so I'll draw a sun above, but I'm not sure if that’s correct for showing both melting and freezing. I’ll use arrows but they look just like lines without labels, and I'm not sure they clearly show the reversal. Finally, I’ll add a cooked egg turning back into a raw egg just to add more changes, though I’m not sure that's right.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a sequence of images showing a block of ice melting and turning into water, then refreezing into ice. The block of ice is on the left, colored blue, and has a sun above it. Next to it, draw a puddle of water, with wavy edges and in light blue. Further to the right, draw another block of ice. Between the ice, add arrows showing the changes, but they have no direction or labels. Include an extra drawing of a cooked egg becoming a raw egg beside the sequence, in a realistic style. Use bold colors with a mix of detailed and simple elements, reflecting a developing understanding.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can and cannot do by including elements they understand and some they struggle with. The ice and water transitions are shown, though the student's ability to make water look realistic is inconsistent. Arrows are included but lack clarity in direction, showing the difficulty with reversibility. Adding a cooked-to-raw egg incorrectly reflects their misunderstanding of non-reversible changes. The sun is present to indicate a cause of melting, albeit not correctly addressing freezing. The drawing style with bold colors and mixed details aligns with a developing understanding level."
