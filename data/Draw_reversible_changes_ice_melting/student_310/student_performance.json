  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can represent ice before it undergoes a change due to heating.",
    "The student can show ice turning into water when heated, but may have inconsistent details (e.g., ice looks realistic, water less so).",
    "The student can depict water after it has been cooled back into ice with some success."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student likely struggles to clearly illustrate that the melting and freezing process is reversible (e.g., may show arrows without labels or direction).",
    "The student might not depict non-reversible changes correctly (e.g., may not include a cooked egg turning back into a raw egg, thinking itâ€™s possible).",
    "The student may not accurately identify the cause of the change (e.g., might label cooling as causing melting).",
    "Patterns of change and reversibility might not be clearly shown or understood (e.g., missing or incorrect sequencing of steps)."
