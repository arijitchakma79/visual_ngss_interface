  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the material before heating, showing the characteristics (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate and label what happens to the material when it is heated (e.g., ice turns into liquid water).",
    "The student can represent and label the process of cooling, showing the characteristics of the material after cooling back (e.g., water becomes solid ice again).",
    "The student can depict and explain which changes are reversible (e.g., ice melts into water and refreezes into ice) through the drawing.",
    "The student can include a comparison in the drawing to show which changes caused by heating cannot be reversed (e.g., cooked egg stays solid and does not revert to a liquid).",
    "The student can use drawings to connect the idea that some changes can be reversed by heating or cooling and some cannot (e.g., consider the example of melted chocolate vs. boiled eggs)."
