  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a piece of ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I’ll draw a simple block of ice and maybe label it 'Ice' so it's clear. Next, I'll draw water below it because ice melts into water when it's heated. I'll make sure to label that process 'melting'. I think I should add an arrow pointing from the ice to the water to show this change. I remember that heating makes ice melt, so I’ll try to draw something that shows heat, like a small sun symbol, but I'm not great at showing temperature details beyond that. Then, to show the change is reversible, I'll draw water freezing back into ice. I’ll draw another block of ice next to the water and an arrow going back, and label it 'freezing'. It’s tricky for me to show the exact conditions needed for water to freeze, so I won’t include the 'below 0°C' details. I’ll also try to show a non-reversible change, like an egg cooking, which might not be as clear as I'd want it to be. I'll draw an egg and a frying pan with arrows and label it 'cooking'. My arrows might not clearly show that cooking is irreversible, but I'll try. I’ll use simple colors to make it look nice and draw everything in pencil and colored pencils to match a grade-level illustration.",
  "Prompt": "An illustration showing the reversible change of ice melting into water and freezing back into ice. On the left, a labeled drawing of a solid ice block colored light blue, with an arrow marked 'melting' pointing down to a puddle of water labeled 'water'. Above the arrow, a small sun is drawn to indicate heating. On the right, the water is shown turning back into ice with an arrow pointing back up, labeled 'freezing'. Below the arrow for freezing, there is no temperature indication. Separately, an egg in a frying pan is drawn and labeled 'cooking', with another arrow, showing a non-reversible change. The drawing uses simple colors like light blue for ice, clear water colors, and yellow for the sun. The style is that of a middle school student's work, using pencil and light colored pencils.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to illustrate ice, water, and the melting and freezing process accurately, matching their ability to label changes and use simple arrows for direction, albeit with some ambiguity. Not specifying conditions like exact temperatures for freezing is consistent with their struggles in the 'cannot do' section. The inclusion of a non-reversible change, like an egg cooking, aligns with their attempt to compare reversible and irreversible changes, despite potential clarity issues, demonstrating the proficiency level of the student."
