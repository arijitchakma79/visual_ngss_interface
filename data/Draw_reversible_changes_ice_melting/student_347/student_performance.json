  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw a picture showing ice before it is heated, possibly labeling it.",
    "The student can draw and label the change of ice melting into water, including some details about the heating change.",
    "The student can illustrate and label water freezing back into ice, indicating understanding of the reversible change.",
    "The student can attempt to show and label a comparison with a change that is not reversible, like an egg cooking, with mixed success."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might leave out or incorrectly label temperatures or may not specify exact conditions needed for the change to reverse (e.g., doesn't specify 'below 0Â°C' for water to freeze).",
    "The student might not clearly show the cause and effect relationship in all parts, particularly struggling to differentiate between heating and cooling processes (arrows might lack clarity)."
