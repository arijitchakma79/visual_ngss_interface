  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a big block to show ice as a solid because I know ice is the solid form of water. I’ll use blue to color it because ice looks cold and blue feels right for it. Then, I'll draw the same block but make it look a bit like it’s disappearing or becoming wavy to show it's melting into water. I'll add a drop or two of water next to it. I know water is usually light blue, so I'll color it light bluish. I'll label the first block 'Ice' and the second part 'Water.' I remember ice can turn back to solid if it gets cold again, so I'll draw a block again beside the water to stand for the ice reformed, but it might be a bit rough looking since I'm not so sure about capturing that process clearly, maybe with one arrow between each stage pointing one direction to the next. I’ll miss drawing arrows going both ways or using words like 'melting' and 'freezing'. I have a hard time showing the stages clearly or explaining why it's reversible change, so I won't add labels like 'reversible' or clear temperature descriptions.",
  "Prompt": "A three-step drawing on lined paper showing the process of ice melting and refreezing. On the left, there's a solid blue block labeled 'Ice'. In the middle, the block is shown partly melting with wavy shapes and a few light blue droplets labeled 'Water'. On the right, another solid block, less defined, labeled 'Ice' again. The whole drawing is in a simplistic style with labels 'Ice' and 'Water' but missing words like 'melting' or 'freezing'. Arrows point in one direction from ice to water to ice, without indicating reversibility or temperature changes.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to show basic elements, such as a block of ice and water, but lacks complexity and clarity in showing full transitions. The colors and labels conform to what the student can do, focusing on simple identification without intricate details or process explanations, reflecting limitations in using scientific terms and showing clear cause-effect sequences. It's intentionally missing reversible cycle labels and arrows indicating both directions to capture the student's struggle with detailing the complete reversible change accurately."
