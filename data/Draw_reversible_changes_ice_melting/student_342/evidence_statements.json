  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the state of a material (like ice) before heating, showing its solid form.",
    "The student can illustrate the state of the material after it has been heated, showing its liquid form (like water).",
    "The student can depict the material as it returns to its original state by cooling (like water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can label each stage of the process to show whether the change can be reversed (e.g., ice to water and back to ice).",
    "The student can visually represent how some changes (like ice melting) can be reversed by adding captions or annotations to the drawing.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of cause and effect by showing how heating causes ice to melt, and cooling causes water to freeze."
