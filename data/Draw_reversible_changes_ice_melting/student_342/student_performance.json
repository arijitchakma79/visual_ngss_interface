  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate ice as a solid block, but may show limited detail or context.",
    "The student can depict the ice melting into water, though might have simplistic representation.",
    "The student can label stages as 'ice' and 'water' without detailed descriptions.",
    "The student can attempt to show the water freezing back into ice, but may do so with basic shapes or limited annotations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might not accurately show the complete process of returning from water to ice with clear transitions (e.g., missing arrows or steps).",
    "The student could fail to label the stages with terms like 'melting' or 'freezing', or may confuse the sequencing *(e.g., labels melting as freezing)*.",
    "The student may struggle to represent the cause and effect relationship clearly, such as not linking heating to melting or cooling to freezing accurately (e.g., missing arrows, labeling issues).",
    "The student might not provide clear captions or annotations that explain the reversible nature of the change *(e.g., lacks a label like 'reversible change')*."
