  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can attempt to draw ice changing to water when it is heated, possibly showing ice cubes and water droplets together.",
    "The student can illustrate some characteristics of ice before it is heated, such as showing blocks or cubes with rough edges to suggest 'solid'.",
    "The student can partially show the characteristics of water after ice is melted, perhaps representing a puddle or wavy lines to suggest 'liquid'."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not clearly show that water can change back to ice when it is cooled, possibly omitting this process or misrepresenting it (e.g., no clear indication of freezing).",
    "The student might not consistently represent the reversible nature of the change, often focusing only on melting and not showing the reverse process.",
    "The cause and effect of heating and cooling might be unclear or incorrect; for example, the student may not use arrows to indicate heating and cooling or may incorrectly associate cooling with melting."
