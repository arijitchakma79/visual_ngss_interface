  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw ice changing to water when it is heated.",
    "The student can draw water changing back to ice when it is cooled.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of ice before it is heated (e.g., solid, cold, hard).",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of water after ice is melted (e.g., liquid, wet, fluid).",
    "The student can show that the change from ice to water and back to ice is reversible.",
    "The student can represent the cause and effect: heating makes ice melt, cooling makes water freeze."
