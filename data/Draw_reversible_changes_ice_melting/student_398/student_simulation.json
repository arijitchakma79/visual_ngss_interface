  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing an ice cube. I know that ice is solid, so I'll make it a boxy shape with straight edges, maybe adding some jagged lines to show it's hard and cold. Next, I'll show that the ice is melting by drawing a few droplets or a small puddle of water beside the ice cube. I remember that water is liquid, so I'll use wavy lines to represent the puddles and droplets. Even though I know that melted water can turn back into ice, I'm not sure how to include that, so I'll just focus on the ice turning into water. I guess I should show something about how the ice is melting; maybe I'll just point an arrow towards the water to suggest it's happening. Even though in class they talked about how heating and cooling change the state, it's hard for me to show a cooler thing freezing water back to ice, and I don't really know how to draw that part.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of an ice cube next to a small puddle of water. The ice is drawn with rough, jagged edges to show it's solid, and the puddle is depicted with wavy lines to suggest it's liquid. Both are on a simple, white background. There's an arrow drawn from the ice cube pointing towards the puddle, indicating the melting process. The drawing is done with colored pencils, using light blue and icy white for the ice, and a darker blue for the water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's understanding by showing an ice cube and a puddle, indicating a transition from solid to liquid. The rough edges on the ice cube and the wavy lines for the water demonstrate basic characteristics of solid and liquid as the student can show. The arrow attempting to indicate the melting process reflects the student's attempt to indicate change without fully understanding how to represent the reverse process or show cause and effect of cooling and heating, which aligns with their struggles."
