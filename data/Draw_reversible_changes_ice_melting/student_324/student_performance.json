  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the material before heating, showing an initial state like an ice cube.",
    "The student can clearly depict the material after heating, showing melted water from the ice cube.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling, demonstrating the reversible change with water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can use arrows and labels effectively to indicate the reversible cycle of ice melting into water and freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can convey through their drawing that some changes are irreversible (such as a cooked egg), although this is not directly represented as part of the ice melting task.",
    "The student can clearly illustrate cause and effect, such as showing that heating causes ice to melt and cooling causes water to freeze."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may show slight inconsistencies in labeling (e.g., might occasionally omit labels or mix them up momentarily), but overall understanding is intact.",
    "The student might include an irrelevant example of an irreversible change in the drawing by mistake (e.g., a sun melting an ice cream cone) but self-corrects through labeling."
