  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start drawing the ice cube before it begins to melt. I remember that the ice should look like a solid block, so I'll draw that and label it 'Ice cube - solid water.' Then I'll think about what happens when the ice cube is heated. I know that heating causes it to melt into water, so I'll draw the melted water next to it and label it 'Melted water - liquid state.' I'm getting a bit carried away and almost draw an unrelated irreversible change like a melted ice cream, but catch myself just in time, because I remember that's not part of this task. To show this is a cycle, I'll draw arrows going from the ice cube to the water showing that heat causes the change. Now for the reversible part: I'll draw the water cooling back into the shape of an ice cube and label it 'Cooled back into ice - solid water.' I have to remember to put arrows going the other way to show that cooling turns water back into ice. Finally, I want to make sure everything is labeled correctly, although I might occasionally write 'frozen water' instead of 'solid ice,' but I think itâ€™s close enough. For a little extra context, I'll draw a small animated sun in the sky to show the heating process and maybe put a snowflake to show cooling, but I need to make sure not to confuse things further.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn diagram illustrating the reversible change of ice melting into water and refreezing into ice. On the left, an ice cube labeled 'Ice cube - solid water.' In the center, melted water labeled 'Melted water - liquid state.' Arrows indicate the process of melting and refreezing. On the right, reformed ice labeled 'Cooled back into ice - solid water.' A sun in the corner to symbolize heating and snowflake to represent cooling. Use colored pencils for a simple, clear illustration, with labels in bold handwriting.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's advanced ability to represent the idea of a reversible change with accurate drawings, clear labels, and causal arrows. It also acknowledges the student's minor struggles such as slight labeling inconsistencies and potential distractions with irrelevant elements like an irreversible change, though the student corrects themselves. The added sun and snowflake provide visual cues to enhance understanding of heating and cooling effects, but are simple enough not to detract from the main task."
