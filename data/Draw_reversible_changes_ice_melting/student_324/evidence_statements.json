  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating, showing its initial state (e.g., show an ice cube).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, showing what it changes into (e.g., show the melted water from the ice cube).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, illustrating if the change is reversible (e.g., show the water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate and label the reversible change between heating and cooling (e.g., arrows and labels indicating ice melting into water and freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can express through their drawing that some changes are not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg cannot turn back into a raw egg).",
    "The student can identify cause and effect clearly in their drawing (e.g., heating causes ice to melt, cooling makes water freeze)."
