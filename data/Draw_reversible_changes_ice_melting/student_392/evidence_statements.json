  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its initial characteristics (solid form).",
    "The student can illustrate the material (e.g., ice) after it has been heated, indicating the changes (liquid form).",
    "The student can depict the material once more after it has been cooled again, showing how it returns to its original state (solid form).",
    "The student can represent how heating changes (e.g., melting ice) can be reversed by cooling (e.g., freezing water), using clear labels to identify the process.",
    "The student can illustrate the cause and effect relationship by showing how heating and cooling cause changes in the state of the material (solid to liquid and back to solid)."
