  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw the ice in its solid form. I remember that ice cubes are usually blocky and clear, so I’ll make a few cube shapes. I’ll use blue to give the impression of coldness. Next, I’ll draw an arrow pointing to the right with the word 'melting' above it. Moving along the arrow, I’ll draw a puddle of water to show the ice melted. I should color the puddle with a light blue to keep the cold color theme. Now, I’ll show how the water turns back into ice. I’ll draw another arrow going right with the word 'freezing.' Lastly, I’ll draw the ice cubes again; this time, they look similar but might accidentally change shape or size a bit. I’ll try my best to use arrows and labels to show the process, even if I might forget a label like 'heating' or 'cooling'.",
  "Prompt": "A science drawing depicting the reversible changes of ice melting and freezing back into ice. On the left, there are solid blue ice cubes, blocky and clear. An arrow labeled 'melting' points to a light blue puddle of water. Another arrow labeled 'freezing' points from the water back to ice cubes, which are slightly different in shape or size than the original. The drawing style is simple, colorful, and clearly labeled to show the process.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to accurately represent the melting and freezing process with most of the necessary labels like 'melting' and 'freezing'. The student's struggles are reflected in potentially omitting minor labels like 'heating' or 'cooling', and showing slight inconsistencies in the size and shape of the re-frozen ice cubes, which were addressed by making the cubes ‘slightly different’."
