  "Reasoning": "I need to draw something about ice melting. Okay, start with an ice cube. I think they are kind of square, so I'll try to draw a square shape. It's tough to make it look like an ice cube, so it might just look like a plain box. Next, I guess the ice cube turns into water. Water? Um, I think I'll draw a wavy shape on the ground beneath the box. I’m not sure what it’s supposed to look like exactly, but at least I have water next to my ice. Should I write something? Maybe I'll label the square as 'water' or something because I get confused sometimes. How about arrows showing melting and freezing? I’ll add arrows, but I'm not sure which direction they should go. I'll just draw them randomly. Reversibility? Hmm, I don’t think I understand how that works, like cooling or heating—so I’ll skip that part.",
  "Prompt": "A simple drawing by a beginning student showing a square shape attempting to resemble an ice cube, without details or labels. Next to it, a roughly drawn, amorphous, wavy shape representing water, also lacking clear boundaries. Random arrows are pointing in assorted directions, but without clear indication of processes like melting, freezing, or reversibility. The drawing is done in basic colored pencils, with a child's use of blue for ice and irregular blue blobs for water on plain paper.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student's ability to attempt drawing a rough shape of an ice cube and water but lacks details, accuracy, and understanding of the processes. The lack of appropriate labels and arrows reflect the confusion and misunderstanding of reversible changes and melting/freezing processes. The style and execution are consistent with a minimal or no understanding level."
