  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw an ice cube shape but likely without detail or labels.",
    "The student may draw an amorphous shape to represent water, lacking clear boundaries."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to label the characteristics of ice or water accurately (e.g., may write 'water' on ice or vice versa).",
    "The student may not illustrate the process of water freezing back into ice (lacks understanding that cooling leads to freezing).",
    "The student is unable to show the melting process accurately (e.g., ice turning into water may not be depicted at all, or might be shown incorrectly as a different change).",
    "The student does not depict or understand the reversible nature of the process (e.g., may show arrows in a random direction or no transformation back into ice).",
    "The student cannot use drawings to explain reversibility by heating or cooling (misunderstands or omits these concepts entirely)."
