  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "• The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., show ice as a solid before heating).",
    "• The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated or cooled (e.g., show ice turning into water when heated).",
    "• The student can demonstrate through a drawing how the material changes back when cooled or heated again (e.g., represent water turning back into ice when cooled).",
    "• The student can depict the concept that some changes are reversible by showing both steps where the material changes and returns (e.g., water to ice and ice to water).",
    "• The student can illustrate an example of a change that is not reversible, such as cooking an egg, to understand the difference in change types."
