  "Reasoning": "Okay, I need to draw a picture about ice melting. First, I think of making a circle. This circle can be the ice. But I am not sure how to show melting, hmm... Maybe I can draw some lines underneath to show that it's changing? But I don’t really know if that's right. I don't really remember what happens to ice when it melts or turns back into ice. I think I’ll just draw another similar shape next to it. That's probably good enough. I shouldn't draw anything cooking since that's not about ice. Perhaps my drawing does not make much sense, but I tried.",
  "Prompt": "A simple and childlike drawing showing two separate, rough, blue circles. One circle slightly consists of short lines beneath it, suggesting movement or change but unclear. The circles do not clearly indicate different states of matter. The background is plain and uncolored, and the drawing lacks detail or any additional elements like drips or melting elements. Overall, the style is simplistic, using basic lines and shapes as a young child's drawing might look.",
  "Explaination": "This drawing prompt correctly reflects the student's ability to draw basic shapes with minimal detail while misunderstanding how to depict the melting process and reversible change. The simplistic circles show a lack of understanding about distinguishing between ice and water. The absence of transformation appropriately represents the student's inability to show the process of ice melting into water or freezing again."
