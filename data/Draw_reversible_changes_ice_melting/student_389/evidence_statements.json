  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can show a drawing of ice before it is heated, capturing its solid state.",
    "The student can illustrate the change from ice to water when heat is applied, showing the melting process.",
    "The student can depict what happens when water is cooled back into ice, emphasizing the reversible change.",
    "The student can include visual comparisons of the material (ice/water) before, during, and after heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show a drawing that demonstrates how heating and cooling can lead to reversible changes using cause and effect relationships."
