  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a shape that looks like an ice cube. I think ice cubes have some sort of form, maybe kind of square. I'll make it a bit blue since ice feels cold. Then, I'll try to draw water. I know water is different from ice, but I'm not sure how they change into each other. I'll just draw water as a wiggly, separate shape. I won't draw them together because I don't quite understand how they connect. My drawing will have ice on one side and water on the other, like two different things. I won't draw anything in between or arrows, because I don't really get that part. I won't add in any kind of heater or sun because I'm not sure how they relate to the ice melting. I won't show the ice turning back into water because I don't know how that happens either.",
  "Prompt": "Create a simple, child-like drawing with an uneven, square-like blue shape on one side representing ice. On the other side, depict a wavy, light blue shape to indicate water. The two shapes should be distinct and separate, with no transition or interaction between them. Use a basic, naive art style with bright colors and no additional elements like arrows or heat sources. The setting should be plain without background elements.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt is aligned with what the student can do, as it includes separate representations of ice and water without connection, depicting their minimal understanding of the change process. It avoids illustrating the melting process or a heat source, reflecting the student's misunderstanding of the role of heat and the concept of reversible changes."
