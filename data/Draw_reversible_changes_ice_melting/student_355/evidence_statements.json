    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, illustrating the change that occurred (e.g., ice becoming liquid water).",
    "The student can show in the drawing how the change can be reversed by cooling (e.g., liquid water turning back into ice).",
