  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big ice cube. I remember that ice is solid and has a square shape with flat sides. I'll use light blue to show it's cold. Next, to show the ice melting, I'll draw an arrow pointing towards a puddle of water. The puddle will be below the ice cube and I'll color it in blue too. Now, for the next part, I have to show the water turning back into ice. I'll draw another arrow pointing from the puddle back to another ice cube, but I hope I won't forget to label something. I'm not sure where to put labels, but I'll try adding a label saying 'Ice' and another saying 'Water' near the puddle. Maybe I'll use a darker color for the arrows to make them stand out, but sometimes I forget which way they should go. I want to make sure it looks like it melts and then refreezes. I might not remember to write 'Reversible change' but maybe the arrows and drawings will be enough to show it.",
  "Prompt": "A simple cartoon-style drawing of an ice-to-water cycle. Start with a large, light blue solid ice cube on the left. Draw an arrow pointing to the right, leading to a puddle of blue liquid water. Below the puddle, have another arrow pointing back to the left towards another ice cube. Include labels 'Ice' next to the ice cubes and 'Water' next to the puddle. Use darker blue or black for the arrows to indicate direction. The drawing shows effort, and the overall style is simplistic but clear, suitable for a student.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects what the student can doâ€”drawing states before and after heating and showing the reverse process through arrows. It also includes their attempt to use labels, even if some are missing, and demonstrates the student's struggle to consistently label and annotate the reversible nature of the changes clearly."
