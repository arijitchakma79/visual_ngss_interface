  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before it is heated, showing its initial state as a solid.",
    "The student can illustrate the material as it is being heated, indicating the change from ice to water.",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, showing the changed state as liquid water.",
    "The student can somewhat label the drawings to explain the process of heating and cooling, highlighting the reversible changes (may miss some labeling details)."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently illustrate the material being cooled after heating, showing the reversed change (e.g., water freezing back into ice) *(student might omit or confuse this step)*.",
    "The student may not fully label parts of the drawing to clearly explain which changes are reversible *(student includes some labels but misses the full explanation of reversibility)*."
