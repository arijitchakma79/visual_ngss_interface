  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before it is heated, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can illustrate the material as it is being heated, indicating the change taking place (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, showing the changed state (e.g., liquid water).",
    "The student can illustrate the material being cooled after heating, showing the reversed change (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can label the drawings to explain the process of heating and cooling, highlighting which changes are reversible.",
    "The student can identify parts of the drawing that show whether the change is reversible or not."
