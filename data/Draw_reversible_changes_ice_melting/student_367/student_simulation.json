  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of ice, because I know ice is the solid form of water. I'll make it blue and use straight lines to show that it's solid. Next, I’ll draw a sun or a little flame to show heat. I remember that ice melts when it gets warm. Then, in the next part, I'll draw the ice turning into water. The water will be in a puddle and I’ll make it look more wavy or flowing to show it's a liquid. I'll label the first drawing as 'solid ice' and the second one as 'melting'. For the last part, I'll show the puddle as just water and label it 'liquid water'. I think it's important to show that the ice turning into water can happen again and again, back and forth. But when I try to show the water turning back into ice, I’m not sure if I’m doing it right. I might just skip it or add it with a simple arrow to indicate the process, but I’m not confident about labeling it correctly. I'll also put a label saying 'reversible change', but I'm not fully sure where to put it.",
  "Prompt": "A three-part drawing showing reversible changes in ice melting. Part one: a blue block of ice labeled 'solid ice', with straight edges for a solid look. Part two: a small, yellow-orange flame or sun near the ice, with the ice melting into a puddle, labeled 'melting', featuring wavy blue lines for water. Part three: a blue puddle, labeled 'liquid water'. Include a simple arrow between the water and the ice to hint at reversibility, but not rigorously showing this change. Labels are somewhat clear but may miss some details.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing shows the student’s strengths in depicting ice turning to water, emphasizing solid and liquid states clearly. Labels partially explain the process, indicating effort to convey the reversible change. It also aligns with the student's struggles, as the depiction of water freezing back to ice is vague and lacks clear labeling, consistent with the inability to fully explain reversibility."
