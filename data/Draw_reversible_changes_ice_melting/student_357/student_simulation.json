  "Reasoning": "I'll draw a picture of ice melting. I know ice is a solid, so I'll draw a shape that looks like a block or a blob to show ice. I think it's important to show the melted ice, so I'll draw a puddle next to it. I remember that ice turns into water when it melts, but I'm not sure how to show the melting process, so I'll just draw them next to each other as separate things. I can't really show how the water turns back into ice, so I'll just focus on the ice and the puddle. I guess I should label these, but I'm not sure what to call them, so I won't label them. I know heat is involved in melting, but I'm not sure where to draw arrows or if I need them.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing a simple, rough outline of a block or blob for ice on the left side of the picture, and a basic puddle on the right side to illustrate melted ice. There are no labels or process arrows depicted. The style is simplistic and lacks detail, with basic shapes and no clear illustration of melting or refreezing. Use basic colors like white for the ice and blue for the puddle, and create a casual, hand-drawn feel.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's capabilities where they attempt to draw ice and a puddle to represent melted ice. It also highlights their struggles, as there is no accurate depiction of the melting or refreezing process, no labels, and the lack of clear scientific concepts such as reversible change or cause and effect, aligning with their minimal understanding."
