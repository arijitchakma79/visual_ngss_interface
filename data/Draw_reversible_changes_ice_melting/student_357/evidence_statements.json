  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before heating, showing its characteristics (solid, cold, etc.).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after being heated (ice turning into water), highlighting the change that has occurred.",
    "The student can depict the material after cooling again, illustrating that water becomes ice once more, showing it is a reversible change.",
    "The student can label each stage of the process (before heating, after heating, after cooling) accurately to demonstrate understanding.",
    "The student can include cause and effect arrows or labels to show how heating and cooling result in changes, indicating observability and reversibility."
