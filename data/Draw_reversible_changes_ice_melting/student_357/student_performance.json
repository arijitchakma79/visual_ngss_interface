  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may attempt to draw ice, but it might lack detail (e.g., a vague shape with no clear solid characteristics).",
    "The student might show a very basic depiction of melted ice, resembling a puddle without clear labels or context."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to illustrate ice turning into water accurately, missing the concept of melting (e.g., ice and water shown as separate, unrelated elements).",
    "The student may not depict the process of water turning back into ice, missing the idea of it being a reversible change (e.g., water stays a puddle).",
    "The student may label stages incorrectly or not at all, showing no understanding of process stages (e.g., stages labeled randomly or with unrelated terms).",
    "The student might omit cause and effect labels, failing to show heating and cooling processes or showing them chaotically (e.g., arrows in incorrect directions or missing)."
