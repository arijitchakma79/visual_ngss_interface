  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material in its initial state before heating (e.g., ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated (e.g., ice melted into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after the heating effect is reversed by cooling (e.g., water turned back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the concept of reversible change by showing how heating and cooling can change the state of the material back and forth.",
    "The student can identify and label the drawings to explain whether the changes are reversible or not."
