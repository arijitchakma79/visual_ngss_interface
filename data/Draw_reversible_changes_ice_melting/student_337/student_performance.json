  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might attempt to draw ice as a block but the representation may be unclear or resemble other shapes (e.g., a rough circle instead of a cube).",
    "The student may use one generic shape to depict both ice and water without a clear distinction.",
    "The drawing might show an attempt at showing change by adding arrows or symbols, though these may not be used correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to show the clear progression from ice to water (melting process not understood or depicted).",
    "The student will not correctly illustrate the reverse change (water back to ice) due to a lack of understanding of reversible changes.",
    "The student will not use labels or will label incorrectly or inconsistently (e.g., mixing labels or using terms like 'cold' without specificity).",
    "There will likely be no depiction of the heating and cooling cycles or they will be incorrect (e.g., arrows used haphazardly or missing)."
