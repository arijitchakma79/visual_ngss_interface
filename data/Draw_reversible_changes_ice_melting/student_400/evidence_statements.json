  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material both before and after heating or cooling to show the change (e.g., ice before heating, and water after heating).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after the process is reversed to demonstrate its return to the original state (e.g., water returning to ice after cooling).",
    "The student can show whether the change in the material is reversible or irreversible using appropriate visual indicators (e.g., arrows indicating transformation from ice to water and back to ice).",
    "The student can include annotations indicating the cause of the changes and their reversibility (e.g., pointing out that heating causes ice to melt and cooling causes water to freeze).",
    "The student can describe through the drawing how some events, like melting and freezing, are part of observable patterns that show cause and effect."
