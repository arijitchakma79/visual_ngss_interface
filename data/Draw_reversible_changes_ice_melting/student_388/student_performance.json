  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before heating and show its characteristics with detailed elements like texture or color.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate the change in the material (ice melting into water) after heating, including drawing droplets and some melted water.",
    "The student can clearly depict the material (water turning back into ice) when cooling is reversed, perhaps with an arrow to indicate the reversibility.",
    "The student can highlight that ice melting is a reversible change through their drawings, using annotations such as 'reversible' or 'can be undone'.",
    "The student can include elements in their drawing to show that other changes (e.g., a cooked egg) may not be reversible, possibly including cross-outs or contrasting symbols.",
    "The student can label the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect (change in state) in their drawing, using terms such as 'heat' and 'cooling'."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally not perfectly depict the passage of time or sequence (e.g., arrows for time might be missing or ambiguous).",
    "The student might overlook labeling or only partially label some features if focusing too much on drawing details."
