  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before heating and show its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material (ice melting into water) after heating.",
    "The student can depict the material (water turning back into ice) when cooling is reversed.",
    "The student can highlight that ice melting is a reversible change through their drawings.",
    "The student can include elements in their drawing to show that other changes (e.g., a cooked egg) may not be reversible.",
    "The student can label the cause (heating or cooling) and the effect (change in state) in their drawing."
