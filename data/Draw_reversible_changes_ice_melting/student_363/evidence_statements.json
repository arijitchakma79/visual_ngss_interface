  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (like ice) before it changes when it is heated.",
    "The student can draw the material (like ice) after it changes when it is heated (like water).",
    "The student can show whether the change (like ice to water) is reversible by drawing the material after it is cooled back to its original state (water back to ice).",
    "The student can illustrate another material before it changes when it is cooled.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it is cooled and how it changes (like water to ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate if the change is reversible by showing the material returning to its original state when it is heated again (ice back to water).",
    "The student can represent a change caused by heating that cannot be reversed (like a cooked egg).",
    "The student can explain in their drawing why some changes are reversible and others are not, using evidence from their illustrations."
