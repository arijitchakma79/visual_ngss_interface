  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw the ice before it melts. I know that ice is solid and looks kind of like a rectangle, so I'll draw a big white block. Then, I'll try to draw the melted ice as water. I remember that water is a liquid, so I'll make a puddle next to the blockâ€”it's just some squiggly lines with blue color. I think that's a good way to show that the ice turned into water. Next, I'll try to show the water turning back into ice. I might add another block of ice, but I'm not sure about the details of how this happens. I'll label the block of ice with 'Solid' and the water puddle with 'Liquid.' I know arrows are used to show changes, but I'm a bit confused about how to use them for showing the ice turning into water and then back into ice. Maybe one arrow between the solid and liquid, going one way, but it looks a bit messy. I'll try to write 'melting' near the arrow, but it might not be clear.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing the reversible change of ice melting. On the left, a solid white rectangle represents ice, labeled 'Solid.' Next to it, a blue puddle labeled 'Liquid' shows melted ice. A second white rectangle sits beside the puddle, symbolizing refrozen ice. The drawing includes one arrow pointing from the ice to the water, labeled 'melting.' The style is simplistic and colorful, using basic shapes and colors with labels. The overall look is unrefined and child-like, typical of an emerging understanding of scientific concepts.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities described in the CAN section. The student is able to draw basic shapes representing ice and water and make simple attempts at labeling them with 'Solid' and 'Liquid.' This aligns with their understanding of showing the different states of matter. The struggle with effectively using arrows or detailed annotations fits the CANNOT section, where the student might not clearly illustrate the process or ensure clarity in the depiction of reversibility. The student might try to show refreezing but lacks refined detail, reflecting their emerging level of understanding."
