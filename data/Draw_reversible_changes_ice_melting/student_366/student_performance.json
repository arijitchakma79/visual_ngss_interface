  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the ice before it melts, showing its solid shape, but may lack detail or clarity.",
    "The student can draw the melted ice as water, showing its liquid form, but the depiction might be simplistic.",
    "The student may attempt to show the water being refrozen back into ice, but with limited detail.",
    "The student might include basic labels or short descriptions for the solid and liquid states."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to fully illustrate the process of heating and cooling as causes for the state change (student might not understand the role of temperature).",
    "The student may not effectively use arrows or annotations to show the reversibility of the process (arrows might be missing or confusing).",
    "The student may misunderstand or neglect to show that the refreezing is part of the reversibility (might not depict the final solid state correctly)."
