  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the ice before it melts, showing its solid shape.",
    "The student can draw the melted ice as water, showing its liquid form.",
    "The student can draw the water being refrozen back into ice, showing that the change is reversible.",
    "The student can include labels or a short description of each state (solid, liquid, and solid again) to demonstrate understanding.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of heating and cooling as a cause that affects the state of the ice and water.",
    "The student can show which part of the process is reversible by using arrows or annotations."
