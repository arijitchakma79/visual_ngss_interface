  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a piece of solid ice, making sure it looks blocky and clear like ice usually does. I remember ice is usually kind of blueish or white in color, so that's what I'll use. I need to label this as 'Ice' with a simple explanation that it’s in solid form. Next, I'll move on to the process of melting. I know if I draw a sun or something representing heat, like a wavy arrow, it will show that the ice is melting due to heat. I'm confident in this part, so I’ll label it as 'Melting due to Heat'. Now I’ll draw liquid water, which should look different than the ice, so maybe ripples would help show it's water, labeling it 'Water - Liquid'. Remembering that this change is reversible, I need to show water turning back into ice. I’ll draw an arrow indicating cooling, maybe using a blue color to show cold, leading back to a solid ice block. I’ll label this transition 'Freezing due to Cooling'. I think I’ve covered all the steps, but let’s make sure all arrows and labels are clear. Sometimes I might forget a little detail, like labeling an arrow, but I feel I’ve got everything pretty much right this time, using cause and effect to show how heat and cooling affect the states.",
  "Prompt": "Create an educational illustration showing the reversible change of ice melting. Start with a block of ice, drawn with light blue and white colors, labeled 'Ice - Solid'. Next, illustrate the melting process with an orange wavy arrow symbolizing heat labeled 'Melting due to Heat', leading to a puddle of water depicted with ripples in a blue hue, labeled 'Water - Liquid'. Conclude with a blue arrow representing cooling labeled 'Freezing due to Cooling' that points back to the ice block. Use a simple and clear drawing style suitable for a middle school science task.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt is aligned with the student's abilities to accurately depict and label each step in the reversible change process of ice melting and freezing. The prompt reflects the student's understanding by including essential elements such as both states of matter, the processes of melting and freezing, and the cause and effect of temperature changes. It also accommodates the student's minor potential to occasionally forget a detail by ensuring all components are required in the prompt."
