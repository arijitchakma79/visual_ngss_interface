  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw and label a piece of ice and describe its appearance before it begins to melt.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting into water and correctly show how heating causes this change.",
    "The student can depict and describe how the melted water can be changed back into ice by illustrating the cooling process clearly.",
    "The student can effectively show that the changes from ice to water and back to ice are reversible by labeling and explaining each step in detail.",
    "The student can use cause and effect logic in their drawing, showing a clear understanding of why heating causes melting and cooling results in freezing."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally have minor gaps or incompletely label a step, such as forgetting to label an arrow indicating the heating process, though this does not affect their overall understanding."
