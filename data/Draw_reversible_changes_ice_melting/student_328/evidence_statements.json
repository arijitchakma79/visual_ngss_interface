  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label a piece of ice and describe how it looks before it begins to melt.",
    "The student can illustrate the ice melting into water, showing how heating causes this change.",
    "The student can depict and describe how the melted water can be changed back into ice by showing the cooling process.",
    "The student can show that the changes from ice to water and back to ice are reversible by labeling and explaining each step.",
    "The student can use cause and effect logic in their drawing to explain why heating causes melting and cooling causes freezing."
