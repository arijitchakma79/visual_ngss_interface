  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately depict the ice cube before the change caused by heating (ice cube drawn and labeled).",
    "The student can correctly show the material after the change by heating, as water (water drawn and labeled).",
    "The student can clearly illustrate the reverse change from water back to ice by cooling.",
    "The student can label each step clearly to indicate which changes are reversible (labeled arrows or text showing changes).",
    "The student can use their drawing to effectively explain how heating causes ice to melt into water and how cooling reverses it, bringing water back to ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Minor inconsistencies or incomplete labeling may occur (e.g., occasionally forgetting a label or an arrow but not affecting overall understanding).",
    "There may be minor aesthetic inaccuracies (e.g., water not drawn perfectly clear, but understanding is unaffected)."
