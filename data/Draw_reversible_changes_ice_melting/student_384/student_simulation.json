  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a big rectangle to represent a glass. Inside the glass, I’ll draw an ice cube. I'll make sure the ice cube is clearly labeled as 'Ice'. Next, I remember that when the ice melts, it turns into water. So, I’ll draw an arrow going down from the ice cube to a puddle of water at the bottom of the glass, labeling it 'Melting'. To show this part clearly, I'll label the puddle 'Water'. Then, to show the reversible change, I’ll draw another arrow going up from the water back to the ice cube, labeling it 'Freezing'. I remember that this shows water turning back into ice. I'll try to make everything clear by writing 'Reversible Change' near my arrows. Now, I’ll check my work. I think I labeled everything, but maybe my ice cube or water isn’t drawn perfectly—ice is easy, but I might have made the water look a bit messy. Still, I made sure all the important labels and arrows are in place to show the change and reverse change.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a hand-drawn style image of a simple science diagram on a white background. The diagram should be in color and show a glass containing a clearly labeled 'Ice' cube at the top. Draw an arrow going downwards labeled 'Melting' leading to a small pool of 'Water' at the bottom of the glass. Next, include an upward arrow labeled 'Freezing', demonstrating the reverse change back to 'Ice'. Add the text 'Reversible Change' near the arrows. Water can look slightly imperfect but maintain clarity through labeling.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do as it accurately depicts both the physical changes from ice to water and vice versa, with labels and directional arrows indicating the process as reversible. The student’s minor struggles, such as slightly messy depiction of water, are reflected in the prompt, but these do not interfere with understanding, as all critical aspects are clearly labeled and organized. The drawing style showcases effort and is appropriate for their advanced level, focusing on clarity over aesthetic perfection."
