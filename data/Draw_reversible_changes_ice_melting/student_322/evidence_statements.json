  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before it is heated to show its initial characteristics (e.g., solid form).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material (e.g., ice) when it is heated (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can depict the material after heating to show the new characteristics (e.g., liquid water).",
    "The student can represent the process of reversing the change by cooling the heated material (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of reversible changes by showing that the final characteristics of the material (e.g., solid ice) are the same as the initial characteristics after reversing the change.",
    "The student can use drawings to make a claim about the reversibility of the change and support it with evidence from their illustrations (e.g., water melts into ice and can freeze back into ice)."
