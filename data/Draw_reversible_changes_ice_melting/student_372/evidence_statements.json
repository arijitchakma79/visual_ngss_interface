  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can depict the characteristics of ice before it is heated (e.g., solid and cold).",
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting into water when it is heated (e.g., turning into liquid).",
    "The student can show the changes in the material when cooling is applied to the melted water (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can represent both the reversible change of water becoming ice again and note that some changes may not be reversible.",
    "The student can use cause and effect by showing that the heating causes ice to melt and cooling causes water to freeze, illustrating observable patterns."
