  "Reasoning": "To start, I'll draw a big, solid block of ice. It should look cold, so I'll add some frost patterns on it. I'll also draw a thermometer next to it showing a low temperature, indicating it's really cold. Next, I'll show the ice beginning to melt: I'll add some droplets forming under the block and sketch a few arrows pointing downward to suggest movement as it melts. To show the reverse, I'll draw another thermometer next to a puddle, this time with a lower reading, and sketch snowflakes to show it's cooling down. I'll then illustrate the puddle forming back into ice. I'll use arrows to indicate the water freezing into a solid again, completing the cycle. I'll write 'reversible change' next to it. Finally, I'll include a small note that not all changes are reversible, maybe drawing a burning candle beside it as a contrast. I'll try to label everything correctly, but I need to double-check spelling, especially scientific terms. I'll aim for neatness and make sure to color everything, but might accidentally miss a spot.",
  "Prompt": "Image of a science drawing showing the reversible process of ice melting and freezing. The drawing includes a solid, cold-looking block of ice with frost patterns and a thermometer showing a low temperature beside it. Arrows point from the ice to droplets forming beneath it, indicating melting. A puddle of water with a lower reading on a thermometer and snowflakes symbolizes water freezing back into ice. There are arrows showing the reverse process, representing the cycle. The words 'reversible change' are neatly written. Additional note about irreversibility is depicted with a burning candle as a contrast. Use colors like blue for ice and water, and avoid leaving any parts uncolored. The drawing should be colorful with clear labels and symbols.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects the student’s understanding and capability to accurately depict the changes and the cyclic nature of the process. The detailed elements, such as frost on ice and thermometers, align with the ability to use visual cues. Limitations are subtly included, as the prompt mentions ensuring coloring is thorough and notes on checking spelling, acknowledging the student’s known pitfalls."
