  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately depict ice as a solid, cold block before heating, likely with visual cues such as frost patterns or a thermometer showing low temperature.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of ice melting by showing a clear transition from solid to liquid, such as droplets forming or a puddle, possibly with arrows indicating movement.",
    "The student can show the reverse process of water freezing by illustrating water turning back into ice with symbols denoting cooling, such as snowflakes or lower thermometer readings.",
    "The student can effectively represent the concept of reversibility by demonstrating water cycling back to ice and may include a note that some changes aren't reversible, adding depth such as depicting other objects that change differently.",
    "The student uses cause and effect with visible indicators that heating causes ice melting and cooling causes water to freeze, with arrows or labels reinforcing this relationship and highlighting patterns, like cyclic motion."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There may be minor inaccuracies in labeling, such as small typographical errors in scientific terms or misalignments in diagram parts.",
    "There could be an occasional oversight in artistic detail, like forgetting to color part of the water or ice, but these don't significantly hinder understanding."
