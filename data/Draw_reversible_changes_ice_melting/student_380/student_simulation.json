  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing some ice cubes. I remember that ice is solid and has a clear shape with sharp edges. I'll make sure to draw them in a light blue color to indicate they're cold. I’ll label this part as 'Ice - Solid state'. Next, I'll draw the melting process. I know that as ice melts, it turns into water, so I'll show the ice turning into puddles of water. I'll use some blue and white for the water to show it's liquid, and I'll label this part 'Melting into Water - Reversible Change'. Then, for cooling it back, I have to show the water turning back into ice. I'll draw ice cubes forming from the water puddles, again, labeling it 'Water freezing into Ice - Reversible Change'. For comparison, I'm supposed to draw an irreversible change, so I'll sketch a cooked egg beside these. I’ll use a yellow for the yolk and white for the egg white. I'll label it 'Cooked Egg - Irreversible Change'. I might forget to label temperatures accurately like 'below 0°C' for freezing, but I'll try my best. I'm not always sure how long these changes take, but I know it's a process affected by temperature.",
  "Prompt": "A detailed drawing showing a series of changes. On the left, ice cubes are depicted in light blue as solid. In the middle, a transition with melting ice into blue-white puddles of water is shown, labeled as 'Melting into Water - Reversible Change'. To the right, there is a depiction of the puddles freezing back into ice cubes, labeled 'Water freezing into Ice - Reversible Change'. In a separate section, a simple drawing of a cooked egg with a yellow yolk and white egg white is shown, labeled 'Cooked Egg - Irreversible Change'. Make this drawing colorful with child-like accuracy, but without precise temperature or time details.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to clearly represent reversible changes by showing both the melting and refreezing processes with appropriate labeling. The inclusion of an irreversible change comparison with the cooked egg demonstrates understanding of different change types. However, the lack of precise temperature labels indicates an area of occasional oversight, consistent with the student's described challenges."
