  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the material before it is heated, showing the solid state of ice.",
    "The student can accurately draw the material after it is heated, clearly showing ice melting into water.",
    "The student can accurately draw the material after it has cooled, illustrating water freezing back into ice (showing understanding of the reversible process).",
    "The student can produce a comparison drawing that illustrates irreversible changes (such as a cooked egg) alongside reversible changes.",
    "The student can label their drawings with simple, accurate descriptions explaining whether the change is reversible or not due to heating or cooling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may exhibit minor gaps such as inconsistent labeling of temperatures (e.g., may forget to note 'below 0Â°C' for freezing).",
    "The student might occasionally omit details like the time taken for each process but still understands the concept."
