  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial state (e.g., a solid piece of ice).",
    "The student can draw the material after it is heated, showing the change (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, if it is reversible, showing it returning to its original state (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the idea that some changes are not reversible by showing a comparison (e.g., a cooked egg cannot return to its raw state).",
    "The student can label their drawings with simple descriptions that explain if the change is reversible or not based on heating or cooling."
