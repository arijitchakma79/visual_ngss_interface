  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big, square block to represent the ice before it melts. I remember that ice is solid. Next, I’ll try to show it melting, so I’ll draw drops of water and some puddles next to the block. I'll mark this part as 'melting' with arrows, but I sometimes forget labels, so that might not be clear. For the water turning back into ice, I’ll draw another block using a different color to show it’s after freezing. Maybe I'll add some arrows for 'cooling', but I might not remember to put all labels. Now, I have to remember that these changes can go back and forth, so I’ll draw arrows showing one way and another. My drawings usually look pretty good, but I hope I haven't made the melted water look too solid or the frozen ice too watery.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a series of three panels in a simple cartoon style. In the first panel, show a solid blue block representing ice. In the second panel, illustrate the ice partially melting, with water droplets and small puddles forming around the block. Use a light blue for the puddles and place a few arrows next to the melting part, optionally labeled 'melting'. In the third panel, depict a new solid blue block indicating that the water has frozen again. Include arrows pointing back to this block from the puddles, optionally labeled 'cooling'. Use bright colors and simple lines to convey a clear but not overly detailed sequence.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to depict both the melting and freezing processes of ice. The inclusion of labels and arrows corresponds to the student's aim to show cause-and-effect relationships, albeit inconsistently. The drawing style matches a proficient level with clear, colorful images, while the potential absence of some labels and small inconsistencies (like not clearly marking partial phases) reflects the struggles noted in the student's profile."
