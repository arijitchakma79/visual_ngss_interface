  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice as a solid block before heating.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material by showing the ice melting into water.",
    "The student can depict the reversed change by drawing the water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can generally use their drawing to make a claim about the reversibility of changes, although the explanation might lack detail."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label their drawing, sometimes forgetting to indicate the cause-and-effect relationship (e.g., missing labels for 'heating' or 'cooling').",
    "While the student generally understands the concept of reversibility, they may occasionally leave out or misplace key details, such as showing partial melting or incomplete freezing."
