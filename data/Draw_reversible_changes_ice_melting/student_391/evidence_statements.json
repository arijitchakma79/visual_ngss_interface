  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, such as showing ice as a solid block.",
    "The student can illustrate the change in the material after heating, like ice melting into water.",
    "The student can depict the reversed change by drawing the material after it has been cooled again, showing water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can use their drawing to make a claim about which changes are reversible and which are not by showing both the heating and cooling processes.",
    "The student can label their drawing to indicate the cause-and-effect relationship between heating/cooling and the material's state change."
