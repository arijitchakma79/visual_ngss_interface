  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (like ice) before heating to show its initial state.",
    "The student can draw the material (like water) after heating to show the change in state.",
    "The student can draw the material (like ice) after the cooling process to show the reversal back to the original state.",
    "The student can illustrate the reversible process, such as ice melting into water and refreezing back into ice, with clear labels and arrows showing the sequence.",
    "The student can include observable patterns and causes in the drawing, demonstrating the concept of cause and effect during the reversible change.",
    "The student can label the drawing with evidence-based claims about the state change being reversible."
