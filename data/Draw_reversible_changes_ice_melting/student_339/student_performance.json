  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice in a solid state before heating, representing the initial state of the material.",
    "The student can draw the change to water after heating, illustrating the state change correctly.",
    "The student can show arrows indicating the sequence of changes from ice to water and back to ice.",
    "The student is likely to include labels with evidence-based claims about the reversibility of the state change, with most labels being clear and correct.",
    "The student can somewhat illustrate observable patterns and cause and effect, although with minor detail or depth."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label the phases or states, occasionally leaving out a label or using vague terms (e.g., labeling water as 'liquid' without specifying 'melted ice').",
    "The student may not fully integrate the concept of cause and effect in a detailed manner, potentially missing subtle causal elements or patterns (e.g., failing to label heating or cooling as the cause of change).",
    "The student might show minor inaccuracies in the sequence or direction of arrows, indicating attempts to show sequence but with occasional errors."
