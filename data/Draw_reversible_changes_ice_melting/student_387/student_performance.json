  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Draw the ice in its solid form before being heated, showing characteristics like its solid shape.",
    "Draw the transition to liquid water after heating, illustrating the melting process with liquid characteristics.",
    "Demonstrate the freezing process to show water turning back into ice, indicating it's a reversible change.",
    "Include arrows or labels to indicate the direction of changes, such as melting and freezing, with appropriate cues.",
    "Partially indicate temperature changes with simple cues (like sun or snowflake symbols), but may not elaborate."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Include detailed visual representations of temperature change or its impact (e.g., exact temperature indications).",
    "Consistently differentiate between warming and cooling phases with advanced details (e.g., specific temperature ranges).",
    "Show complete understanding of the microscopic changes in state (e.g., molecular structure changes).",
    "Always note or illustrate the process as reversible in all possible cases (occasional missing reversibility indicators)."
