  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a big cube of ice because I remember that ice is solid and has a clear shape when it's still cold and frozen. I'll make sure the edges are sharp to show it's solid. Now, I need to draw the ice changing into water; I'll draw the cube melting into a puddle, showing some drops of water to emphasize the melting. I'll use an arrow pointing from the solid ice to the water to show the melting process. To show it's getting warmer, I'll draw a sun symbol above the ice and water. Next, I'll depict water turning back into ice by drawing an arrow from the puddle back to a new ice cube. Here, I'll put a snowflake above to show it’s getting cold. I won't show any tiny details like how the molecules change or exact temperatures because I'm not quite sure how to do those. I know the changes are reversible because ice can melt and then freeze again, but sometimes I forget to show all the reversibility parts.",
  "Prompt": "Create a child-like drawing showing the reversible change of ice melting and freezing. Begin with a large, solid ice cube, emphasizing its sharp edges and solid form. Next to it, show a melting process: draw a puddle of water with drops suggesting it's melted. Use arrows: one pointing from the ice cube to the water puddle to represent melting, and another from the puddle to a new ice cube to show freezing. Add a simple sun symbol above the melting ice and a snowflake above the freezing process to indicate temperature changes, but without detailed temperature information. Use bright colors for the sun and cool shades for the ice and water. The style should be simple and colorful, resembling a drawing by a proficient primary school student.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt aligns with what the student can do by focusing on solid and liquid states and using arrows and symbols to indicate changes. The drawing includes temperature cues like the sun and snowflake but doesn’t get into detailed temperature effects. The prompt omits detailed molecular changes and assumes the student might occasionally miss showing reversibility completely, though primary indicators are included (arrows and transformations). The art style is suitable for a proficient student, showing effort without advanced details."
