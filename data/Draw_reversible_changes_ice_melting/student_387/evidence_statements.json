  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before it is heated, showing its characteristics (e.g., solid form, cold to touch).",
    "The student can draw the material after it is heated (e.g., ice melting into liquid water), illustrating the new characteristics (e.g., liquid form, warmer to touch).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling it again (e.g., water turning back into ice), indicating its return to original characteristics (e.g., solid form, cold to touch).",
    "The student can include visual representations of the change process to demonstrate that the change from solid ice to liquid water is reversible through cooling.",
    "The student can use arrows or labels to clearly indicate the direction of changes (e.g., melting and freezing) and whether each change is reversible."
