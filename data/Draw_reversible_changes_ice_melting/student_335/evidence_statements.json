  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate a change by drawing the material before it is heated or cooled (e.g., ice as a solid).",
    "The student can depict the material after it has been heated (e.g., ice melting into liquid water).",
    "The student can show how the material changes back by cooling (e.g., liquid water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can label the drawings to indicate which changes are reversible by heating or cooling.",
    "The student can draw a scenario where heating or cooling results in a change that is not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg that does not become raw again).",
    "The student can use arrows or labels to illustrate the cause and effect pattern of how heating or cooling affects the material.",
    "The student can incorporate signs or symbols to highlight the difference between reversible and irreversible changes."
