  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a solid block of ice. I know that ice is cold and solid, so I'll make sure it looks like a block with some icy texture on it. Next, I'll show arrows pointing to the right to indicate that the ice is going to melt. I'll add a sun symbol or wavy heat lines above the ice to represent heating, because heat causes ice to melt. Now, for the next part, I’ll draw a puddle of water next to the melted ice to show that it's turned into liquid water. I'll remember to label the ice and the water, so it's clear what each part is. Then, I'll draw arrows going back from the puddle of water to a block of ice, indicating that the water can freeze back into ice. I'll add wavy lines to show cooling or maybe a snowflake above the water to show it’s getting cold. I sometimes forget to include when changes aren’t reversible, but that's okay for now because this is just about the reversible part. I'll write labels like 'Ice', 'Melting', 'Water', 'Freezing', and 'Ice Again' to indicate what's happening. I could use special symbols to show things like reversible and irreversible changes, but I often mix them up or forget where to put them, so I’ll focus on labeling clearly instead.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing the reversible change of ice melting and refreezing. There is a solid block of ice on the left with an icy texture and arrows pointing to the right, indicating melting. Above the ice, there's a sun symbol or wavy heat lines to imply heating. Next, there's a puddle of water representing melted ice, with arrows going back from the water to a new block of ice on the right to show refreezing. Above the water, add wavy lines or a snowflake to indicate cooling. Each stage is labeled: 'Ice' for the block, 'Melting', 'Water' for the puddle, 'Freezing', and 'Ice Again' for the final block of ice. Use a simple, child-like style with clear, distinct colors for each part.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt captures what the student can do: showing the process of ice melting and refreezing with clear illustrations of each stage brought to life with distinct labels. The student uses arrows and symbols to illustrate the effects of heating and cooling. However, the prompt also highlights their limitations by omitting any irreversible changes and avoids using potentially confusing symbols for reversibility, matching the student's understanding and level of proficiency."
