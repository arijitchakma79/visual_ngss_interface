  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big block of ice. Ice is cold and solid, so I'll use a simple square shape to show that. Then I need to show it melting into water. I’ll draw some lines below the ice to represent water, like a puddle. I remember that the water comes from the ice when it gets warm, but I’m not sure how to show the water turning back into ice, so I'll just sketch some shapes that look more abstract. Next, I should try to label what's in my drawing like teacher said; I'll write 'Ice' next to the block and 'Water' next to the puddle. Oh, wait, I think I should show an example of change, maybe an egg. But I’ll just draw an egg and write 'Reverse?' next to it because I can’t remember what to do with it. I don't really know how to draw the parts turning into each other, so I'll leave out some arrows or words that explain these parts. I'm not sure what else needs labeling, so I’ll skip some of it.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple scene with a large white square labeled 'Ice' to represent a block of ice. Below it, draw a wavy blue line labeled 'Water' to show a puddle. Add an abstract shape nearby, like an undefined gray shape that doesn't clearly depict ice reforming. Include an egg shape labeled 'Reverse?' with no indications of change. Use a basic and childlike, slightly messy drawing style with crayons.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's understanding accurately. They can depict ice melting to water but struggle with the re-solidification process, shown by the abstract shape. Labels are few and may be incorrect or incomplete. Including an improperly contextualized egg demonstrates confusion between reversible and irreversible changes. The drawing, described as simplistic and slightly messy, matches the student's developing skill level."
