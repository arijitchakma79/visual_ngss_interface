  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the original state of the material as a solid block of ice, but it might be a simple representation without much detail.",
    "The student can illustrate ice melting into water when heated, though details like puddle shapes might be simplistic or missing."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately represent the water turning back into solid ice after cooling with clarity (may draw abstract shapes instead of clear ice forms).",
    "The student might not show the complete or correct sequence of changes, potentially showing steps out of order (e.g., ice directly turning into water vapor without tracing the initial melting).",
    "The student may inconsistently label parts of the drawing or omit explanations for the changes, lacking detailed observation (labels might be missing or incorrectly assigned to stages).",
    "The student may draw an example of irreversible change, such as a cooked egg, but confuse it as reversible or render it in a way that doesn't clearly show irreversibility (e.g., showing it reverting to raw egg form)."
