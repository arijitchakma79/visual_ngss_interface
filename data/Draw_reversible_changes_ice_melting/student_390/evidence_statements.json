  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its original state (e.g., ice as a solid block).",
    "The student can draw what happens to the material after it is heated, like ice melting into water.",
    "The student can draw the material after it cools down again, such as the melted water turning back into solid ice.",
    "The student can illustrate examples of irreversible changes, such as a cooked egg, to show understanding that not all changes can be reversed.",
    "The student can show the correct sequence of changes, highlighting the cause and effect of heating and cooling.",
    "The student can label each part of the drawing to explain the changes taking place."
