  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw and label ice before heating, showing characteristics like solid state and cold temperature.",
    "The student can illustrate and label ice after heating, demonstrating the change to water, identifying characteristics like liquid state.",
    "The student can depict water after cooling, showing it freezing back into ice, with labels indicating the state change.",
    "The student can label reversible changes, such as water freezing into ice and melting back into water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may inconsistently label or partially forget to label characteristics such as temperature changes associated with each state.",
    "The student might not fully comprehend or misrepresent some non-reversible changes, such as comparing with a raw egg and cooked egg transition, occasionally showing confusion by including reversible terminology.",
    "The student might not clearly illustrate the cause and effect in some drawings, such as missing or misplacing arrows to indicate the process of heating and cooling."
