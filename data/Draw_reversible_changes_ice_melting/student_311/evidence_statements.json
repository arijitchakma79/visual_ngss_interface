  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating and label its characteristics.",
    "The student can illustrate the material (e.g., ice) after heating, showing the change (e.g., ice becomes water) and label its characteristics.",
    "The student can depict the material (e.g., water) after cooling, showing the reversal of the change (e.g., water becomes ice again) and label its characteristics.",
    "The student can label which changes are reversible and provide an example, such as water freezing into ice.",
    "The student can understand that some changes are not reversible by drawing a comparison (e.g., raw egg to cooked egg, which cannot return to raw by cooling).",
    "The student can describe through illustrations how heating or cooling affects the material, showing the cause and effect relationship."
