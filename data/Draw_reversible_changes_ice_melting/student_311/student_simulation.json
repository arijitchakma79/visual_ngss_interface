  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of ice on one side of my paper. I remember that ice is a solid, so I'll make it look like a cube with shiny sides to show it's cold. I'll write the word 'Ice' and label it as a solid. Next, I'll draw arrows pointing to a puddle of water next to it. This is to show that the ice melts after heating. I need to write 'Water' next to it and label it as a liquid, but I'll make sure to include only a little bit about it being at room temperature. After that, I'll make another arrow pointing from the water back to an ice cube to show it freezing again. I'll label this as 'Freezes back to ice'. I might struggle a bit with the last part; I have to remember to show it as a solid again with characteristics like being cold. I must not mix up these reversible changes with something like cooking an egg, where I sometimes get confused. I also need to remember to put arrows showing the change direction from heating to cooling, even though I might miss a few details.",
  "Prompt": "A student drawing on paper showing an ice cube labeled 'Ice - Solid' on one side, with an arrow pointing to a puddle of water labeled 'Water - Liquid'. Another arrow points back from water to an ice cube labeled 'Freezes back to Ice'. The drawing is in pencil with some poorly erased areas, showing effort but imprecision, with any colors being light blues and grays for the ice and droplet effects. Arrows are sketched clearly yet are slightly uneven, and the melting and freezing processes are illustrated with solid lines. The style resembles a young student's attempt, with clear labels but slightly messy handwriting, with slight inconsistencies in temperature labeling.",
  "Explaination": "This prompt fits the student's abilities because it includes the necessary labels and states for ice melting and freezing, which the student can do. The drawing has a somewhat messy and imprecise style that matches the student's propensity to inconsistently label or not fully detail temperature changes. The use of clear but uneven arrows shows both the understanding of reversible changes and the student's occasional struggle with cause-and-effect drawing details."
