  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a big block of ice on the left side of the paper. I remember that ice is solid and usually has a defined shape, so I’ll give it a clear outline, maybe a cube shape, and color it with light blue to show it’s cold and solid. Next, I need to show the ice melting. I'll draw arrows pointing from the ice block downward, as if it’s turning into water. I'll color the melted water in a light blue color but without the solid shape, just a puddle at the bottom. I should label this 'water' but sometimes I forget these labels. Remembering to include the reversal, I’ll draw another set of arrows going from the water puddle back to another block of ice, to show the water freezing again. This second ice block should look like the first one, as if it's 'the same ice again,' even if I can’t quite express how it’s the same. Finally, I’ll make sure to include arrows back and forth, maybe add a symbol like a two-headed arrow or a caption explaining this is reversible. I hope I remember to label everything correctly, but it might be hard to avoid missing one small label.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a science-based illustration depicting the reversible process of ice melting. On the left, there is a solid, cube-shaped block of ice in light blue, indicating its solid state. Arrows point downward from the ice, showing it melting into water. The water is also light blue but lacks a fixed shape, forming a puddle. Include arrows pointing back from the water to a second cube-shaped block of ice, identical to the first, to illustrate refreezing. Use two-headed arrows or symbols to highlight the reversibility of the process, and include labels such as 'ice' and 'water'. The drawing is colorful and clear, in a simple and educational art style appropriate for a grade-level science illustration.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to illustrate ice melting and reforming with directionality and color, demonstrating understanding of reversible changes. It also suggests potential omissions or oversights in labeling, aligning with the student's occasional difficulties with annotation specifics."
