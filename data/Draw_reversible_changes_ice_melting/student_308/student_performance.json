  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately illustrate the characteristics of ice before heating, such as solid shape and clarity.",
    "The student can effectively depict the process of heating that causes ice to melt into water, using arrows to show directionality and movement.",
    "The student can clearly show the characteristics of water after the ice has melted, including its liquid form and lack of a fixed shape.",
    "The student can accurately draw the process of cooling that turns water back into ice, again using arrows to illustrate the change.",
    "The student can demonstrate the characteristics of ice after water has been cooled and frozen again, showing its solid state and similar appearance to the initial ice.",
    "The student can symbolize the idea that the change from ice to water and back to ice is a reversible change, potentially by using symbols or annotations.",
    "The student can use their drawing to support the claim that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed, including labels or captions that explain the reversibility."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally miss minor labels or annotations in the drawing (e.g., forgets to label 'water' explicitly).",
    "While attempting complex annotations, the student may write slightly ambiguous explanations (e.g., 'It's the same ice again' without further detail)."
