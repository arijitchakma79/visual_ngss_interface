  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a picture of a solid block of ice. I remember that ice is transparent and can be drawn with light blue and white to make it look cold and solid. I'll make sure to show it on a flat surface to emphasize that it's just sitting there, not melting yet. Next, I'll draw another image beside it, where the ice has melted into water. I'll use darker blue to represent water and try to show it pooling on the surface where the ice used to be. There should be a clear difference between the solid ice and the liquid water. Then, I’ll draw the same water refreezing back into ice. I'll draw the liquid turning back into a solid ice block, maybe using lighter blue lines to indicate freezing. Lastly, I'll write a few notes or labels to indicate that the ice can melt and refreeze, showing it's a reversible change. I'm not quite sure how to show irreversible changes like a cooked egg, so I won’t add that to my drawing, as I might not do it correctly.",
  "Prompt": "A sequence of three images showing reversible changes with a simple drawing style. First image: a solid block of ice on a flat surface, using light blue and white colors. Second image: melted water where the ice was, depicted with darker blue, making sure to show the difference between solid and liquid. Third image: the water refreezing back into ice, using light blue lines to represent the transition back to solid. Include labels indicating this process as 'reversible'.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do by including a clear illustration of ice melting into water and then refreezing back into ice, showing understanding of reversible changes. The use of color distinguishes states of matter, satisfying the student's proficiency in illustrating reversible changes clearly and correctly. The omission of irreversible changes like a cooked egg reflects the student's struggle with and misunderstanding of these types of changes, aligning with the 'cannot do' aspects."
