  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the original state of the material, like ice before melting.",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, such as ice turning into water.",
    "The student can represent the material after the heating process is reversed, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can illustrate at least one example of an irreversible change caused by heating or cooling, like a cooked egg or a baked cookie.",
    "The student can depict how a reversible change (like ice melting and refreezing) supports the idea that some changes can be undone by heating or cooling.",
    "The student can show how evidence from their drawing supports the claim that not all changes after heating or cooling can be reversed."
