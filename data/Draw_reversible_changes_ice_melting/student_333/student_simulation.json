  "Reasoning": "I’m supposed to draw something about ice melting. I know that ice is hard and cold; it’s like those cubes we have in the freezer. So, I’ll start by drawing a square shape and make it look like an ice cube. I’ll write ‘ice’ next to it because that’s what it is. I remember that when ice is out of the freezer, it changes, but I'm not exactly sure how to draw that. I guess I can make a little puddle next to the ice cube, but I’ll just leave it like that. I’m not sure what to label it as, so I won’t write anything there. I know ice is supposed to turn into water, but I don’t know if it can go back to looking like a cube again. I’m just going to focus on the ice cube and a little puddle because that’s what I remember seeing.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing of an ice cube labeled 'ice' with a small puddle beside it. The ice cube is a simple blue square with no texture, and the puddle is a small, irregular blue shape. The drawing is made with colored pencils, with the ice cube and puddle both in light blue. There are no arrows or additional labels, capturing an elementary, simplistic style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures the student's ability to identify an ice cube as a solid form ('CAN') but also reflects the confusion in illustrating the process of melting and freezing as reversible ('CANNOT'). The drawing does not show the ice cube transitioning to water explicitly and lacks labels or arrows that indicate direction or process, adhering to the student's level of understanding."
