  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a solid piece of ice. I'll use light blue for the ice cube and make sure to add some shiny lines to show it's frozen. I'm going to label this as 'Ice - Solid State.' I won't forget the label this time! Next, I need to show what happens when ice melts. So, I'll draw a puddle of water. I'll use a darker blue for the water to make it clear it's melted ice. I'll label this 'Water - Liquid State.' Oh, and I must not forget to put a little arrow between the two drawings to indicate the change due to heating. Then, I'll draw ice again, to show that it can freeze back. I'll make the new ice cube the same color as the first and label it 'Ice - Re-frozen.' This will show the reversibility. I'll add another arrow back to the ice to indicate cooling causes the water to freeze again. I think it's important to note that this is reversible, unlike something like cooking an egg. I'll add a small doodle of an egg with a line through it to show it's not reversible. I'm trying to include all the details, but I hope I don't forget anything small on the labels, like I sometimes do.",
  "Prompt": "A realistic drawing of reversible changes: First, a light blue ice cube with labeled 'Ice - Solid State', followed by a dark blue puddle labeled 'Water - Liquid State', and another ice cube, same as the first, labeled 'Ice - Re-frozen'. Include arrows between these with labels 'Heating' and 'Cooling' to depict changes. Add a simple crossed-out doodle of a cooked egg to show irreversibility. Use a clear drawing style with simple labels and description lines, in colored pencil style.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by capturing the reversible process of ice melting and refreezing with labeled drawings and arrows, while including a simple example of an irreversible change. It reflects the student's capacity for accurate representation and labeling, while acknowledging the tendency to occasionally overlook minor details such as missing a label initially."
