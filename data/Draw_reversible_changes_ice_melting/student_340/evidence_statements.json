  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its original state.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating (e.g., ice has melted into water), showing the changes.",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling (e.g., water has frozen back into ice), indicating the reversibility of the change.",
    "The student can include labels or simple descriptions to show characteristics of the material in each state (before heating, after heating, after cooling).",
    "The student can illustrate which changes are reversible and which are not, using examples (e.g., ice to water is reversible; cooking an egg is not).",
    "The student can connect the cause (heating or cooling) to the observable effects (state changes) in their drawings.",
    "The student can use their drawings to support a claim about the reversibility of changes caused by heating and cooling."
