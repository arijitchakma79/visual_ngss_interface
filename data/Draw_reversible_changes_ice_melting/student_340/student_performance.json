  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its original state with clear labeling.",
    "The student can draw the material after heating (e.g., ice has melted into water), clearly illustrating the change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling (e.g., water has frozen back into ice), accurately reflecting the reversibility of the change.",
    "The student can include detailed labels and simple descriptions to show characteristics of the material in each state, capturing the entire process.",
    "The student can illustrate which changes are reversible and which are not, using effective examples (e.g., ice to water and back is reversible; cooking an egg is not).",
    "The student can connect the cause (heating or cooling) to the observable effects (state changes) in their drawings with clarity.",
    "The student can use their drawings to support a claim about the reversibility of changes caused by heating and cooling, effectively supporting it with accurate illustrations."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally omit a minor detail in labeling (e.g., forgets to label water after melting but remembers in subsequent drawings)."
