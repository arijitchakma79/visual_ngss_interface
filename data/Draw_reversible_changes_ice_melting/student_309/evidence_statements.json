{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of a material before it is heated or cooled, such as an ice cube.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material when it is heated, like ice melting into water.",
    "The student can show what happens when the material is cooled again, such as water turning back into ice.",
    "The student can make a drawing that includes both reversible changes (like ice to water and back to ice) and examples of irreversible changes (like an egg being cooked and not returning to its original state).",
    "The student can visually represent the concept that some changes can be reversed by cooling or heating, while others cannot."
