  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student might draw a simple shape to represent an ice cube, but with limited detail or accuracy.",
    "The student could include an additional shape or scribble next to the ice cube that may be intended to represent melting, but not clearly water."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately illustrate the process of ice melting into water (student may not understand the transformation).",
    "The student probably does not show the process of water freezing back into ice (does not grasp the concept of reversibility).",
    "The student might not depict any irreversible changes, such as an egg being cooked (student may not differentiate between reversible and irreversible changes).",
    "There may be no indication that heating or cooling affects the material (student may not associate these actions with changes in state)."
