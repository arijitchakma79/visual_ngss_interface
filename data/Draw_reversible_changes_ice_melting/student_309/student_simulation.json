  "Reasoning": "I need to draw how ice melts. I can picture an ice cube. I’ll draw a square because that’s kind of the shape of an ice cube. I’m not sure how to show melting, but I’ll draw a shape next to the ice cube. Maybe if I scribble next to it, it will look like it’s melting. I don’t really remember what happens when the ice melts and turns into water or how it turns back into ice.",
  "Prompt": "A simple hand-drawn scene on paper. In the scene, there is a rough, light blue square representing an ice cube. Next to the square, there are squiggly lines and a random shape, in gray, maybe like a puddle or scribbles, symbolizing melting. The drawing style is childlike and unrefined, with minimal color and detail.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt shows a realistic depiction of a student at a beginning understanding level who can draw a basic shape resembling an ice cube but struggles with showing the process of ice melting into water and reversibility. The squiggly lines and random shape reflect the intended transformation but are inaccurate, demonstrating limited comprehension of the task."
