  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate the material's characteristics before heating, showing solid ice with clear labels.",
    "Illustrate the material's characteristics after heating, depicting liquid water after the ice has melted, with correct labeling.",
    "Illustrate the reversal of the change by showing liquid water turning back into solid ice through a cooling process.",
    "Depict the idea that some changes can be reversed by showing a heating and cooling cycle, with arrows indicating these processes.",
    "Use their drawing to support a claim about the reversibility of the change by identifying cooling as a process that can be repeated to return water to ice."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "Provide a clear explanation in their drawing about the molecular changes occurring during the phase change (may not understand molecular-level changes).",
    "Fully detail the conditions required for the reversal (e.g., specific temperatures for freezing and melting).",
    "Consistently label every part of the process accurately (may miss labels like 'heat' or 'cool')."
