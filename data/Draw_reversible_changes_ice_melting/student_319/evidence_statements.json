  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material's characteristics before heating (e.g., show solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the material's characteristics after heating (e.g., show liquid water after ice melts).",
    "The student can illustrate the reversal of the change (e.g., show liquid water turning back into solid ice through cooling).",
    "The student can depict the idea that some changes can be reversed by showing a process, like heating and cooling, that returns a material to its original state.",
    "The student can use their drawing to support a claim about the reversibility of the change by identifying which steps can occur repeatedly."
