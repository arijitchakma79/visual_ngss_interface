  "Reasoning": "I'll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I'll make sure to clearly draw a cube with some light blue color. I'll add the label 'Ice (Solid)' to it. Next, I need to show what happens after it melts. I'll draw a puddle of water next to the ice. Water should be clear, so I'll use a bit of light blue again and label it 'Water (Liquid)'. I'm going to add an arrow between the ice and the water to show melting, and I'll label it 'Melting'. Now, I have to show how the change can reverse. I'll draw another arrow going from water back to ice and label it 'Freezing'. I'm not exactly sure about the temperatures, so I’ll leave those out. For showing heating and cooling, I’ll put small symbols like a sun and snowflake above the arrows. I think I'll label 'Heat' with the sun and 'Cool' with the snowflake. I hope that's enough to show the concept, even though I might miss some details and labels, especially molecular changes.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a simple, clear science-themed drawing showing reversible changes, especially ice melting and refreezing. Start with a light blue ice cube labeled 'Ice (Solid)' on the left. Next to it, on the right, depict a light blue water puddle labeled 'Water (Liquid)'. Include an arrow between the ice and water marked 'Melting', along with a sun symbol and the label 'Heat' to indicate the melting process. From the water back to the ice, draw another arrow labeled 'Freezing', with a snowflake symbol marked 'Cool'. Use a simple, textbook illustration style with clear labels and basic color indications for ice and water.",
  "Explaination": "The drawing prompt matches what the student can do because it includes clear depictions of ice and water with labels like 'Ice (Solid)' and 'Water (Liquid)'. It also shows arrows indicating the processes with simple symbols like a sun and a snowflake for heating and cooling, which aligns with illustrating a reversible change. The student struggles with molecular-level details and specific temperature conditions, which is why such information is not part of the diagram. Labels and symbols are included, but acknowledging that some might be incomplete or missed is appropriate given the student's level description."
