  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating by showing ice in its solid state.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating by depicting ice melting into liquid water.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling again, showing liquid water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can clearly indicate the change as reversible by using arrows or labels.",
    "The student can depict the cause of the change (e.g., a sun for heating, a freezer for cooling).",
    "The student can label each stage clearly to show understanding of the process, including 'before heating', 'after heating', and 'after cooling'.",
    "The student can include annotations describing the characteristics of materials before and after changes, such as labeling states as 'solid', 'liquid', and noting 'reversible'."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "There might be minor inconsistencies, such as slightly unclear labeling on rare occasions (e.g., labels slightly misplaced but still understandable)."
