  "Reasoning": "First, I’ll draw a block of ice in its solid state. I'll use blue and white colors to make it look cold and solid. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing to the right to show the change happening and then sketch the melted ice as a puddle of water. I remember that it represents the liquid state, so I'll color it light blue. I'll add a sun above the puddle to show it's heated by the sun. Then, I'll draw another arrow pointing back to a new block of ice to show it solidifies again when cooled. I'll use a freezer to symbolize this cooling part, with the freezer labeled. The ice block after cooling will also have a blue color. I’ll clearly label 'before heating', 'after heating', and 'after cooling'. I’ll write 'solid' next to the ice and 'liquid' next to the water. I'll make sure to label the process as 'reversible' by writing it next to one of the arrows. Although I usually place all labels correctly, I'll try not to misplace them even slightly this time.",
  "Prompt": "Create a hand-drawn style illustration showing the reversible changes of ice into water and back into ice. On the left, depict a solid block of ice with a blue and white color, labeling it 'solid' and 'before heating'. In the center, show the ice melted into a light blue puddle of water, indicating it was heated by adding a yellow sun overhead, and label it 'liquid' and 'after heating'. On the right, illustrate the water refrozen into ice, with blue color again, next to a simple drawing of a freezer, showing that it has cooled, and label it 'after cooling'. Use arrows between each state to indicate the change, and label one arrow clearly with 'reversible'. Include all labels as described, ensuring clarity.",
  "Explaination": "The image generation prompt captures the student’s capabilities to depict the sequence of changes ice undergoes during melting and refreezing, using clear illustrations and annotations. The student’s strengths in labeling states and processes accurately are reflected in the prompt. However, care is taken to describe the drawing style as 'hand-drawn' to reflect the potential for minor inaccuracies, like slightly unclear label placements, aligning with the given limitation."
