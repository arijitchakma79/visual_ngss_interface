  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating or cooling (e.g., show ice as solid state).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating (e.g., show ice melting into liquid water).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after cooling again, returning to its original state if reversible (e.g., show water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can indicate whether the change after heating or cooling is reversible (e.g., by showing an arrow or label).",
    "The student can depict how heating or cooling causes the change (e.g., show a sun or a freezer as a cause of the change).",
    "The student can label each stage clearly to show understanding of the process (e.g., before heating, after heating, after cooling).",
    "The student can include annotations that describe the characteristics of the material before and after changes (e.g., 'solid', 'liquid', 'reversible')."
