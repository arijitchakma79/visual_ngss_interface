  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice melting to show the change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can label the solid material before heating (ice) and describe its characteristics.",
    "The student can label the liquid material after heating (water) and describe its characteristics.",
    "The student can show in their drawing that the liquid water can freeze back into ice, illustrating the reversible change.",
    "The student can use arrows or symbols in the drawing to indicate the process of heating (melting) and cooling (freezing).",
    "The student can include labels or notes to explain that some changes, like ice melting into water, can be reversed, while others cannot.",
    "The student can create a sequence of drawings to represent the entire process of melting and refreezing to demonstrate understanding of reversible changes."
