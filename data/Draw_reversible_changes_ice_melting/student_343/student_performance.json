  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a picture of ice melting to show the change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student can label the solid material as 'ice' and include some description of its characteristics such as 'cold' or 'hard'.",
    "The student can label the liquid material as 'water' and describe it as 'wet' or 'fluid'.",
    "The student can show in their drawing that liquid water can freeze back into ice, portraying the reversible change.",
    "The student can use arrows to indicate the process of heating (melting) and cooling (freezing).",
    "The student might include notes explaining the reversibility of the changes (e.g., 'can turn back into ice')."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully sequence the whole process of melting and refreezing in separate and distinct stages (struggles with sequence representation).",
    "The student might occasionally omit or incorrectly label one of the intermediate steps, such as forgetting to show cooling as a part of the process (incomplete labels).",
    "The student might not use symbols consistently to indicate temperature change (inconsistent application of symbols/arrows).",
    "The student may not clearly contrast reversible and irreversible changes in their explanation notes (lacks depth in some conceptual notes)."
