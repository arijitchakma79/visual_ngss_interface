  "Reasoning": "I'm going to draw ice melting into water and then turning back into ice. First, I'll draw a block of ice. I remember that it is solid, so I'm using sharp edges to show it's hard. I'll label it as 'ice' and add 'cold' next to it, because ice is cold to touch. Next, I'll draw an arrow pointing down for melting, which shows the ice turning into water. Now, I'll draw a puddle of water below the ice. Water is a liquid, so I'll make it look fluid and label it as 'water' with a note saying 'wet'. I'll also add an arrow going back up from the water to the ice, to show freezing. Under the second arrow, I'll write 'can turn back into ice' to show that this change is reversible. Hmm, I think I might forget something like showing cooling clearly, but I'll try my best. Maybe I'll add sun for heat but might miss a snowflake for cooling. Let's make sure to show that water can freeze back into ice. Sometimes I mix up the symbols or arrows, but I'll do my best to be consistent.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn scene showing a block of ice on the left labeled 'ice' with the word 'cold' next to it, connected by a downward arrow to a puddle of water on the right labeled 'water' with the word 'wet' next to it. Above this puddle, an upward arrow goes back to the ice, showing freezing, with the note 'can turn back into ice'. The background should have a simple sun symbol above to indicate heating. Use bright blue for ice, light blue for water, and simple black linework. The drawing style should be childlike but detailed, emphasizing the states of matter.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's abilities by showing ice and water with clear labels and characteristics like 'cold' and 'wet'. It also highlights a reversible change with arrows between the two states, although lacking full stage sequencing and some missing symbols like for cooling. The use of a sun adds context for heating, albeit without a cooling symbol, fitting the student's partial conceptual understanding."
