  "Reasoning": "I’m going to start by drawing a block of ice. I think I’ll use a rectangle to show the ice cube; that seems simple enough. I remember that when ice melts, it turns into water, so I’ll draw some drops and a small puddle beside the ice. I’ll try to make the puddle a bit squiggly to show it's water instead of just a big flat shape. I should probably write something next to it, like 'melting', so it’s clearer that the ice is becoming water. I know that ice can turn back into a solid, but I’m not sure how to show it going back into ice or what to write to explain 'freezing', so I’ll leave that out. The drawing looks okay, but it's hard to get the idea of it turning back into ice across clearly. I just have to remember to show what I can for the melting part.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing of a simple block of ice as a blue rectangular shape on the left with some light blue shading to show it's ice. Beside it, on the right, there is a small puddle of water illustrated with wavy lines and water droplets around it, showing melting. The word 'melting' is written next to the droplets. The style is simple with basic colors, using large lines to make it clear for a younger student's level.",
  "Explaination": "The prompt reflects what the student can do by showing an attempt to illustrate the process of melting with simple shapes like a rectangular block for ice and wavy lines for water. It includes the word 'melting' to suggest the change, aligning with the can-do of showing the melting aspect. The drawing does not include a reversal to ice or the term 'freezing', matching the student's struggle to depict the full cycle or clearly indicate reversibility."
