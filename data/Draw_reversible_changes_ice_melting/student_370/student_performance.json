  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "Illustrate the state of ice before it is heated with a basic drawing of a block of ice.",

  "CANNOT": [
    "Consistently depict water turning back into ice accurately (may show liquid reducing but not becoming a defined ice shape).",
    "Label changes clearly to show reversibility (may write 'melting' beside ice but not indicate 'freezing').",
    "Provide a clear description or key to indicate the reversibility of the changes (may omit or provide a vague note that doesn't clearly convey reversibility)."
