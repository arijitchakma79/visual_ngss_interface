  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, illustrating the change (e.g., ice melts into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling it again, showing the reverse change (e.g., water freezes back into ice).",
    "The student can label their drawings to identify the stages: before heating, after heating, and after cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate the concept that some changes (like ice melting and freezing) can be reversed, while others cannot.",
    "The student can use their drawings to construct a simple argument, using labels and arrows, to show that heating and cooling lead to observable changes."
