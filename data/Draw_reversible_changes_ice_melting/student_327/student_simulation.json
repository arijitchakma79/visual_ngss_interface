  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a solid block of ice. I know ice is hard and cold, so it should look like a neat blue cube. I'll label it 'before heating' to show this is where the ice starts. Next, I'll draw what happens when the ice melts. I'll make a puddle or something like it, and I'll make it a light blue color to show it's still water. I'll label this part 'after heating'. Sometimes I forget labels, but I'll try to remember all of them. Now, I'll draw the water turning back into ice. I'll draw ice cubes this time, since the water could have been in an ice cube tray, and I'll label this 'after cooling'. I remember I'm supposed to show that these changes can go both ways, so I'll use arrows between the stages to show melting and freezing. I need to remember to make it look like a cycle, but I sometimes just draw arrows one way. I think this covers all the parts, but I might forget one or not make the arrows clearly show the full cycle.",
  "Prompt": "A child-like drawing showing three stages of ice melting and freezing. On the left, there's a solid blue block of ice labeled 'before heating'. In the middle, there's a light blue puddle labeled 'after heating'. On the right, there are small blue ice cubes labeled 'after cooling'. There are arrows between the stages, some of which might only point in one direction rather than forming a complete cycle. The drawing uses simple and bright colors with clear but not overly precise labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's level of proficiency. The student can illustrate the process of reversible change with appropriately labeled stages, though they may occasionally miss or misplace labels. The student understands the need to use arrows to show the transition, but may struggle to fully convey the cyclical nature of the process. The use of simple forms like a block for ice, a puddle for melted water, and cubes for refrozen ice aligns with the student's abilities and understanding, with some omission of details due to their current proficiency level."
