  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "The student is proficient, showing most elements clearly and correctly.",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its initial state as a solid block of ice.",
    "The student can draw the material after it has been heated, illustrating the change as ice melts into water, typically by showing a puddle or liquid form.",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling it again, showing the reverse change, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can label their drawings to identify the stages: before heating, after heating, and after cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate the concept that some changes, like ice melting and freezing, can be reversed and may use simple arrows to indicate this process.",
    "The student can construct a simple argument with labels and arrows, explaining that heating and cooling lead to observable changes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might inconsistently label drawings or miss a label for one of the stages (e.g., the 'after heating' stage might be shown without a clear label).",
    "The student may not fully elaborate the argument using arrows, potentially having all arrows pointing only one direction instead of a cycle indicating reversal.",
    "The student could omit small details, like not distinguishing between the different states of water when frozen again, possibly showing a generic block rather than discrete ice cubes."
