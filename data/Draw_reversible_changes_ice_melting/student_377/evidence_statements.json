  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of ice before it melts, showing it as a solid.",
    "The student can illustrate the characteristics of water after the ice has melted, showing it as a liquid.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of melting, emphasizing that ice turns into water when heated.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of freezing, showing that water turns back into ice when cooled.",
    "The student can show an example of a reversible change by depicting both the melting and freezing cycle of ice and water.",
    "The student can label the drawings to explain whether the change from ice to water and back is reversible.",
    "The student can connect their drawings to the concept that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed (like ice and water), while others cannot."
