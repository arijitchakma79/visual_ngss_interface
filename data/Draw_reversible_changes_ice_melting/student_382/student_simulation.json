  "Reasoning": "I’ll start my drawing by sketching a big block of ice. I know ice is solid, so I’ll draw it as a big, blue rectangle with a few jagged edges to show it's cold and hard. I remember that when ice melts, it turns into water, so next, I’ll draw some water underneath the block of ice. I'll make the water a light blue and make it look like a puddle with little waves on top. I should label my drawing to show it’s changing from ice to water. I'll write 'ice' near the block and 'water' near the puddle. I'm not sure how to draw the process where the water turns back into ice - we didn't talk much about this in class, and I think I’d need to add an arrow, but I’m not sure where. I know heat causes melting, but I'm not sure how to consistently show that. I’ll draw a bright yellow sun in the corner because I think that represents heat. I know I’m missing the part where the water freezes again, but I’m just not sure how to show that yet.",
  "Prompt": "A hand-drawn image showing a block of ice in the upper part of the frame, depicted as a blue jagged rectangle labeled 'ice'. Below it, there is a light blue puddle labeled 'water', indicating the ice has melted. In the top corner, a simple bright yellow sun shines down, representing the heat. The drawing style is child-like with simple lines and colors, lacking detailed shading or realism.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can do by showing ice as a solid and water as a liquid, and labels these states clearly, demonstrating an emerging understanding of state change. It includes a visual representation of the heat as a sun, but lacks the depiction and labeling of the cooling process that returns the liquid water back to ice, in line with the student's areas of struggle. Additionally, the prompt captures the inconsistent or missing representation of the cause of the transition, emphasizing effort but also the learner’s developmental level."
