  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice in its initial solid state before any heating occurs. (Recognizes ice as solid form)",
    "The student can draw water to show ice melting, indicating a change has occurred due to heat. (Understands change of state from solid to liquid)",
    "The student can include a basic label or note that indicates the change is from ice to water. (Can identify change but details may lack clarity)"
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student cannot adequately show the cooling process leading back to ice. (May not understand or include reversal of the change)",
    "The student cannot fully explain why the changes are reversible, possibly omitting labels or simple sentences. (Lacks understanding of reversibility concept)",
    "The student may not consistently identify the cause of the change (e.g., adding heat) or may show it incorrectly with missing or inaccurate indications. (Inconsistent understanding of cause-effect)"
