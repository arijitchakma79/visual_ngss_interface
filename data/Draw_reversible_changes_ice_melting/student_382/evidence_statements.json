  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before heating or cooling, showing its initial state (e.g., ice as a solid).",
    "The student can draw the material after heating, showing the change (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can draw the material after cooling, if the initial change was heating (e.g., water freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can include in the drawing whether the change is reversible or not and explain why with simple sentences or labels.",
    "The student can identify in the drawing the cause of the change (e.g., adding heat) and show the effect this has on the material.",
    "The student can illustrate and label the different stages, showing understanding that heating can cause changes that may be reversed by cooling (like ice to water and back to ice)."
