  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a simple block of ice. I know that ice is a solid, so I'll draw a cube to represent it. Next, I'll show what happens when the ice is heated. I remember that the ice turns into water, so I'll draw some wavy lines to represent water and put them next to the melting cube to show it's becoming liquid. After that, I need to show the process turning back into ice. I know that if I cool the water, it becomes ice again, so I'll draw arrows showing water turning back into a cube of ice. I don't remember the exact temperatures, like 0°C for freezing or melting, so I won't include that detail in my drawing. I should also remember to draw everything clearly and correctly to show the reversibility of these changes.",
  "Prompt": "A simple, child-like drawing depicting the process of ice melting and refreezing. The image features three main stages: a cube representing solid ice on the left, wavy lines for liquid water in the middle, and another cube for ice again on the right. Arrows between the stages indicate the transition of states, one from ice to water and another from water to ice. The drawing is colorful with blues and whites to show ice and water, and uses simple line art to depict these changes. The style should be basic and illustrative, showing the concept of reversible changes using child-friendly imagery.",
  "Explaination": "This image prompt matches the student's abilities and limitations by focusing on the key concepts of reversible changes without requiring detailed scientific knowledge like specific temperature points. The progression from ice to water and back to ice is clearly shown, indicating an understanding of reversibility, but without labeling specific temperature conditions."
