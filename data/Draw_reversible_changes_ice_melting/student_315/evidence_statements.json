  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it is heated, indicating a change (e.g., ice becomes liquid water).",
    "The student can depict what happens if the cooling process reverses the change (e.g., liquid water refreezing into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate an understanding that some changes are reversible through heating and cooling by showing examples (e.g., ice melting and refreezing) and can describe* these changes.",
    "The student can describe* through drawings the observable patterns or outcomes that result from heating or cooling (e.g., melting, refreezing).",
    "The student can identify and illustrate scenarios where the changes are not reversible (e.g., cooking an egg or baking cookie dough)."
