  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated, showing its initial state as solid ice.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after it is heated, indicating a change to liquid water.",
    "The student can depict the cooling process that reverses the change, showing liquid water refreezing into ice.",
    "The student can demonstrate an understanding that changes such as ice melting and refreezing are reversible and can describe these processes in basic terms through their drawings.",
    "The student can generally describe through drawings the observable outcomes of heating or cooling, like melting and refreezing."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not always label changes with specific temperature terms or specific conditions for freezing and melting (e.g., not specifying 0Â°C for freezing).",
    "The student may have minor gaps in depicting non-reversible changes and might include an incorrect example or omit specific details about why some changes, like baking, aren't reversible."
