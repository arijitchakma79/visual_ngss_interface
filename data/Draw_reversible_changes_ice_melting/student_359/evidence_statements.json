  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (like ice) before heating, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can illustrate the material (like ice melting into water) during and after heating to show the change.",
    "The student can depict the material (like water turning back into ice) after cooling to demonstrate the reversibility of the change.",
    "The student can label their drawings to explain the cause and effect relationship of heating and cooling, showing which changes are reversible.",
    "The student can add notes to their drawings to describe characteristics of the material in each state: before, during, and after the changes."
