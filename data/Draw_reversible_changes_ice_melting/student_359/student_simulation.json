  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a block of ice to show its initial solid state. I remember that ice has a definite shape, so I'll make sure it looks like a solid cube. Next, I’ll draw the ice melting. I know that when you heat ice, it turns into water, so I’ll draw drips coming off the cube to show melting. I'll label this part as 'melting' and 'heating.' Then, I'll draw a puddle of water to represent the melted ice. I know this water should look different from the solid ice because it flows and doesn’t have a shape. I should label it 'liquid water,' but I might forget to add 'liquid' in the label here. After that, I'll draw the process of freezing back into ice. I'll make the water look like it's getting colder and turning back into its original shape. I'll label this part as 'freezing' and 'cooling.' Throughout, I have to make sure the labels make sense, but sometimes, I mix up the order or forget material characteristics.",
  "Prompt": "A simple colored drawing depicting the reversible process of ice melting and refreezing. On the left, show a block of solid ice, labeled 'solid ice,' which looks clear and has defined edges, representing its shape. Next, draw melting with dripping water from the ice cube, labeled 'melting' and 'heating.' In the center, depict a puddle of water, labeled 'water,' indicating its liquid state, with slight ripples to suggest flow, but avoid using the term 'liquid.' On the right, illustrate the water refreezing into a solid state by showing small ice crystals forming, labeled 'freezing' and 'cooling.' Use a child-like, hand-drawn style with simple colors, reflecting a proficient understanding of the reversible change concept.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt captures what the student can do well, such as drawing the solid ice and the melting process with correct labels like 'melting' and 'heating.' It also highlights areas where the student might struggle, like occasionally omitting the term 'liquid' from the label for water or mixing up sequences. The prompt ensures the drawing reflects their proficiency level by being mostly correct with minor, realistic inaccuracies typical for their level."
