  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 3,
  "Level Description": "Proficient (shows most elements clearly and correctly)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw the ice in its initial solid state, clearly showing its shape before heating.",
    "The student can accurately illustrate the process of ice melting into water, showing the transition as it heats up.",
    "The student can depict the water refreezing back into ice, demonstrating an understanding of the reversibility of the change.",
    "The student can label their drawings to explain the cause (heating) leading to melting and freezing upon cooling."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student might label some drawings incompletely or miss a few key elements in the labels (e.g., missing the term 'liquid' for water).",
    "The student may sporadically omit notes describing material characteristics (e.g., might not always describe 'liquid' as 'flows' or 'solid' as 'hard').",
    "The student might slightly confuse the sequence of changes, occasionally leading to a minor mix-up in order (e.g., showing ice appearing before cooling is mentioned)."
