  "Reasoning": "Let's see, I need to draw ice melting as a reversible change. I know ice is solid, so I'll start by drawing a block or maybe some cubes of ice first. I'll use blue to show that it's cold. Next, ice turns into water when it melts, so I'll draw some water next to the ice, maybe make it wavy to show it's liquid. I should show that the ice melts because it gets warmer, but I always forget how to draw that. I'll skip it for now. Now, ice can freeze back into ice when it's cold again, but I'm not sure how to show freezing without just drawing ice again. I'll just leave a note that says 'freezes back' and connect it with an arrow. I know I'm supposed to draw arrows to show how the changes happen, but I get confused about which way they should go. Oops, I forgot that not everything can go back to how it was, like cooked eggs, but since I'm doing ice, that should be fine. I'm not sure I'm showing everything in the right order or clearly, but at least I have ice turning into water and kind of back again.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a simple illustration of an ice block drawn in blue, representing solid ice. Next to the ice, there is a wavy line drawing of water in blue to indicate liquid water. There are arrows connecting the ice and water, but they are not very clear or in the correct direction. There's a handwritten note saying 'freezes back' near the ice block with an arrow leading back to the ice. The drawing is in a basic, colorful style typical of a young student, with an incomplete illustration of reversible changes. The background is plain, focusing solely on ice and water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the 'can do' list by including a basic drawing of ice and water, capturing the reversible concept of ice melting into water. The student describes using arrows and a note to imply possible refreezing. The 'cannot do' aspects are reflected in the unclear and incomplete illustration of a cycle without fully showing how these changes happen via heating or cooling, and possible mix-ups in the sequence of reversible processes without showing non-reversible changes."
