  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, such as ice in its solid form.",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after it is heated, showing ice melting into water.",
    "The student can depict the material when the heating or cooling is reversed, illustrating how melted water can freeze back into ice.",
    "The student can represent the idea that some changes caused by heating (like melting ice) are reversible, while others (like a cooked egg) are not.",
    "The student can illustrate the concept of cause and effect by showing how heating leads to melting and cooling leads to freezing, demonstrating an understanding of observable patterns in these changes."
