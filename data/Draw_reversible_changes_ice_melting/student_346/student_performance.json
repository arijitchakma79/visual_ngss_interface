  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw a material before it is heated or cooled, likely showing ice in its solid form as a block or cubes.",
    "The student can illustrate ice melting into water, though the depiction may lack detail or clear transitions.",
    "The student can attempt to represent the idea that ice can freeze back into its original form, but the process may not be fully clear."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may not fully illustrate the complete cycle of reversible change (e.g., might skip showing ice refreezing).",
    "The drawing may miss showing that some changes are irreversible, like a cooked egg, due to focusing only on reversible changes *(student may think all changes are reversible)*.",
    "The student might confuse the cause-effect relationship, possibly not using arrows or clear indications to show heating and cooling processes.",
    "The concept of showing patterns in changes might be inconsistently applied with mixed success in terms of depicting sequence and direction."
