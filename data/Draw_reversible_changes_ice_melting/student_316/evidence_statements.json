  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the starting material, such as ice, showing its original state before heating or cooling.",
    "The student can illustrate the change that happens to the material after heating, like ice turning into water.",
    "The student can depict the process of reversing the change, such as water freezing back into ice.",
    "The student can label each part of their drawing to explain the characteristics of the material at each stage: before heating/cooling, after heating/cooling, and after the reverse process.",
    "The student can show, through their drawings, which changes are reversible and which are not.",
    "The student can include cause and effect labels in their drawing to demonstrate understanding that heating and cooling cause observable changes."
