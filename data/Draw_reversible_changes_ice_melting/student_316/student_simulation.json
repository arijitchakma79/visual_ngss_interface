  "Reasoning": "First, I'll start by drawing a big block of ice. I'll make sure to include details that show it's ice, so I’ll draw its crystalline structure with some jagged edges and shade it in a light blue color because ice reflects light that way. I'll label it 'solid ice, before melting' so it's clear what I'm depicting. Next, I’ll draw an arrow pointing from the ice to a puddle, to indicate the process of melting. I'll write 'heat applied' alongside the arrow because that's what causes the ice to melt. The puddle of water needs to look like liquid, so I'll draw it as a round, shiny, wavy surface, with darker blue lines to show movement. I'll make sure to add the label 'liquid water, after melting'. Now, I'll add another arrow in the opposite direction from the puddle of water back to the ice shape, describing the freezing process. I'll label this arrow with 'cold applied' and the process 'water freezing back into solid ice'. At the end, I'll add a note that says 'reversible change', showing which changes can be reversed. I'll double-check everything to see if I left out anything important, like labels or arrows. Wait, I almost forgot, I should make sure arrows indicate heating and cooling directions properly.",
  "Prompt": "Create an educational science drawing showing reversible changes of ice melting, suitable for an advanced elementary student. Start with a large block of crystalline ice, detailed with jagged edges and shaded in light blue. Label it 'solid ice, before melting'. Draw an arrow labeled 'heat applied' from the ice block to a puddle of water, indicating the melting process. The water should appear as a round, shiny, wavy surface with darker blue lines suggesting movement. Label it 'liquid water, after melting'. Then, draw another arrow labeled 'cold applied' leading from the puddle back to the ice block, to depict freezing. Label this process 'water freezing back into solid ice'. Finally, add a highlight noting 'reversible change'. Use a colorful and clear educational style to effectively convey the concept.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including detailed representations of each stage of the phase change, such as the crystalline ice and wavy lines for water, and labels on both states and processes. The inclusion of reversible change highlights understanding of the reversibility concept. Minor struggles such as potentially omitting arrow directions are addressed by specifying directional arrows with process labels, ensuring clarity and alignment with the student's level."
