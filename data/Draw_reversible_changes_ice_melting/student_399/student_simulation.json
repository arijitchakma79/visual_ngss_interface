  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw a solid block of ice. I'll make sure to label it clearly as 'Ice - Solid' to show it's before melting. Next, I need to illustrate the ice melting. I'll draw arrows going downwards to show the melting process and add some vapor lines to represent the heat. I'll label this part 'Melting - Reversible Change'. Now, I'll show water as the next stage by drawing a puddle or pool and label it 'Water - Liquid'. To indicate the change can be reversed, I'll draw more arrows going upwards with a label 'Freezing'. I'll finish by drawing a solid block of ice again and label it 'Ice after Freezing'. Hmm, I need to be careful not to accidentally mix this with irreversible changes, like a cooked egg - they are different. I also have to remember to label everything properly and keep the arrows pointing in the correct direction. Oh no, I accidentally placed an arrow too close to the wrong part earlier. I'll fix it, but might forget to label one of the final ice blocks accurately.",
  "Prompt": "A science drawing showing reversible change through ice melting: A solid block of blue ice labeled 'Ice - Solid' at the left. Arrows pointing downward labeled 'Melting - Reversible Change', with heat vapor lines above them. A puddle of clear water labeled 'Water - Liquid' follows. Additional arrows point upwards, labeled 'Freezing', leading to another solid blue ice block labeled 'Ice after Freezing'. The drawing is colorful with a focus on blue and white strokes, resembling a child's drawing style. Some labels may be missing or arrows slightly misplaced, showing a learning process.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt matches the student's abilities by including labeled depictions of ice before and after melting, with arrows showing the reversible nature. It captures the student's capability to depict reversible changes effectively and use visual cues like vapor lines. However, the prompt also reflects the student's occasional missteps, like misplaced arrows and potentially missing labels, aligning with the level description of occasionally forgetting labels or connecting visual elements inconsistently."
