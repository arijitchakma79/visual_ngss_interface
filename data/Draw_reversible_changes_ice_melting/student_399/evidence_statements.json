{
  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material (e.g., ice) before heating or cooling, showing its initial state.",
    "The student can depict the material (e.g., ice turning into water) after heating, indicating the change.",
    "The student can create a drawing of the material after reversing the heating or cooling process (e.g., water turning back into ice).",
    "The student can illustrate whether the change is reversible or not by using arrows or labels (e.g., ice to water and back to ice is reversible).",
    "The student can show how heating or cooling can lead to both reversible and irreversible changes (e.g., ice versus a cooked egg) using separate sections in the drawing.",
    "The student can use visual elements to connect evidence to claims about reversible changes, demonstrating understanding of cause and effect (e.g., how ice melts when heated and refreezes when cooled)."
