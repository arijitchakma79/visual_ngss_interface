  "Reasoning": "First, I'll draw ice as it starts. I know ice is a solid, so I'll draw a few ice cubes on one side of the page. I want to make sure they look like solids, so I’ll make them have a clear square shape. Next, I'll draw water right next to the ice cubes to show that when ice melts, it turns into liquid water. I remember that this step is called melting. I’ll write 'melting' between the ice cubes and the water. I should also write 'reversible' somewhere here to show I understand that this can go back and forth. I’m not too sure about the freezing back into ice part, so I might just write 'freeze' above the water, but I’m a little confused about how to draw that happening. I should show this as happening in a cycle, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that. I'll make errors if I try too hard to draw the freezing process, so I'll keep it simple. I won’t draw arrows or detail for the refreezing step because I don’t fully remember. I think I’ll color the ice cubes blue, and the water light blue to show they’re different states. I don't think I'll draw any environmental factors, like cold air making the water freeze back into ice, because I'm not sure how that affects the process here.",
  "Prompt": "A drawing showing a few large, blue ice cubes on the left side labeled 'solid'. Next to them, a puddle of light blue water labeled 'liquid'. The word 'melting' is written with a small arrow pointing from the ice to the water. The word 'reversible' is written between the solid and liquid, but no detailed arrows or drawings show the refreezing of water into ice.",
  "Explaination": "The image reflects what the student can do, such as accurately drawing and labeling the ice and water to show the melting process and recognizing it as a reversible change. The student struggles with depicting the freezing process and conditions for reversibility, so these elements are either omitted or shown with confusion, aligning with their developing level of understanding."
