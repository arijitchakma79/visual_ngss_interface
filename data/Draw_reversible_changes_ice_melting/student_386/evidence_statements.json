  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material before it is heated or cooled, showing its initial characteristics (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can illustrate what happens to the material after heating or cooling, capturing the change (e.g., ice turning into liquid water when heated).",
    "The student can depict the material after the change is reversed by cooling or heating, if applicable (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can label if the change is reversible or not in their drawing (e.g., reversible change for ice and water).",
    "The student can include patterns or reasons for why the change is reversible (e.g., water can refreeze due to lower temperatures)."
