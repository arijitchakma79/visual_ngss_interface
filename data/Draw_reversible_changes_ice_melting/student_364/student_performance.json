  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating or cooling, such as ice in its solid state, with accurate detail.",
    "The student can depict the changes in the material after heating, showing ice melting into water, using clear stages in their drawing.",
    "The student can show the changes in the material upon cooling again, illustrating how the water freezes back into ice, completing the cycle effectively.",
    "The student can emphasize the idea that some changes, like ice melting and freezing, are reversible through their drawings, demonstrating clear understanding.",
    "The student can label their drawings to indicate each stage of the change: before heating, after heating, and after re-cooling, with mostly correct and comprehensive labels.",
    "The student can include drawings showing that some changes (like an egg cooking) remain irreversible after heating, clearly distinguishing these from reversible changes."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally label an element incorrectly or miss adding a minor detail, but this is uncommon and not due to misunderstanding. *(minor mistake due to oversight, not lack of understanding)*"
