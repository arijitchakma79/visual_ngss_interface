  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can illustrate the material before heating or cooling, such as ice in its solid state.",
    "The student can depict the changes in the material after heating, showing ice melting into water.",
    "The student can show the changes in the material upon cooling again, illustrating how the water freezes back into ice.",
    "The student can emphasize the idea that some changes, like ice melting and freezing, are reversible through their drawings.",
    "The student can demonstrate understanding of how other changes caused by heating or cooling might not be reversible.",
    "The student can label their drawings to indicate each stage of the change: before heating, after heating, and after re-cooling.",
    "The student can include drawings showing that some changes (like an egg cooking) remain irreversible after heating."
