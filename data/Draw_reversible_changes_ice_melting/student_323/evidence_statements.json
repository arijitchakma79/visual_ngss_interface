  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw and label the material before heating or cooling, showing its original state (e.g., solid ice).",
    "The student can draw and label the material after heating, showing the change that occurs (e.g., ice melting into water).",
    "The student can draw and label the material from the previous state after cooling, illustrating its ability to return to the original or a new state (e.g., water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can demonstrate and label how some changes are reversible, using arrows or labels (e.g., showing a cycle of ice melting into water and freezing back to ice).",
    "The student can illustrate another example and label a change that is not reversible (e.g., a cooked egg remaining solid without returning to a raw state)."
