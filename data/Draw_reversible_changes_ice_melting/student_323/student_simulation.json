  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing solid ice. I remember that ice is solid, so I'll draw a cube with little lines on it to show it’s a block of ice. I’ll label this 'Solid Ice'. Next, I know ice turns to water when heated, so I’ll draw some water in a puddle shape next to the ice block and label it 'Liquid Water'. This shows melting. Now, I need to show that water can turn back into ice. I'll draw another block of ice appearing next to the water, almost like it came from it, and label it 'Frozen Ice'. Now for the transitions. I’ll try to use arrows to show how ice melts into water and how water freezes back into ice. I'll draw an arrow from the ice to the water and another going back from the water to the ice. Sometimes I get confused with arrows or forget to label them, but I’ll try to make them clear. Finally, I’ll write little labels under arrows like 'Melting' and 'Freezing'.",
  "Prompt": "A simple pencil sketch showing three stages of the water cycle: a block of solid ice labeled 'Solid Ice', a puddle labeled 'Liquid Water', and another block of ice labeled 'Frozen Ice'. Include arrows between the stages with small labels: an arrow labeled 'Melting' pointing from the 'Solid Ice' to 'Liquid Water' and another arrow labeled 'Freezing' pointing from 'Liquid Water' to 'Frozen Ice'. The arrows are clear but not perfectly placed. The sketch should look like a student's drawing with some neatness but slight imperfections. Incorporate light blue shading for the ice and water.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt reflects the student's ability to draw and label the process of melting and freezing, showing the reversible cycle. The student can label the states and transitions, although the arrow placement may be imprecise. The task aligns with their capability to mostly clearly depict reversible changes, avoiding irreversible changes like cooking an egg, which they might incorrectly represent. The use of light blue helps enhance recognition of ice and water, matching a grade-level appropriate attempt with minor mistakes in execution."
