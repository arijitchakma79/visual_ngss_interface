  "Reasoning": "I’ll start by drawing a block of ice. I remember ice looks rigid and angular, so I'll try to give it a square shape. Now, I’ll show it melting. I'll draw another shape that looks like a puddle next to the ice. Maybe I should use an arrow to show that the ice melts into water. I remember from class that a sun means heat, so I'll draw a sun above the ice to show it's getting warmer. But I think I forgot to label the ice and water. I'll skip that for now. I know the teacher mentioned something about it going back to ice, but I can't remember how to draw that. I'll just show the ice melting into water for now.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a blue block of ice on the left and a small blue puddle of water on the right. An orange arrow goes from the ice to the water to indicate melting. Above the ice, there is a bright yellow sun with orange heat lines coming down. The style is simple and sketchy, with crayon-like textures and no labels.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt matches what the student can and cannot do because it shows an effort to depict the change from ice to water, which the student can illustrate, although only partially with a single arrow. The drawing includes the concept of heat by featuring a sun, aligning with the student's ability to indicate temperature change. However, it lacks labeling of the substances and does not include the complete cycle or reversal, showing the student's emerging understanding."
