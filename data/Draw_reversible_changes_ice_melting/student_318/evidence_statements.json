  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the characteristics of ice before any change, such as its solid form.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of heating ice and turning it into water.",
    "The student can depict the characteristics of water after ice has melted.",
    "The student can show the process of cooling water to become ice again.",
    "The student can distinguish between reversible and irreversible changes through drawings, such as showing water freezing back to ice (reversible) versus a cooked egg not turning back to raw (irreversible).",
    "The student can include drawings that highlight cause and effect, like how heating causes ice to melt and cooling causes water to freeze."
