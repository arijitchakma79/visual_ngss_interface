  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 2,
  "Level Description": "Developing (emerging understanding, basic elements shown)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can draw ice in its solid form, showing some basic characteristics like angular shapes or a block form.",
    "The student can illustrate ice turning into water but may only partially show this sequence without clear stages, perhaps with a single arrow indicating change from solid to liquid.",
    "The student might indicate a temperature change by drawing a sun or heat lines next to the ice to show it melting."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is likely unable to accurately depict the entire cycle of changes, such as showing water turning back into ice (may forget to complete this cycle).",
    "The student might mix up reversible and irreversible changes, perhaps drawing a different example like juice being spilled as irreversible.",
    "While they may draw an arrow indicating change, they might omit labels or explanations, such as not labeling the water or the ice correctly *(student forgetfully omits these details)*.",
    "The student's cause and effect drawings may be incorrect or incomplete, like missing arrows for cooling or labeling them incorrectly *(e.g., cooling labeled as heating)*."
