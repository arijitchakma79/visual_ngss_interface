  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (ice) before it is heated, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can draw the process of heating the material, showing the transition of ice into water.",
    "The student can draw the material (water) after heating, showing its liquid state.",
    "The student can illustrate the process of cooling the material, demonstrating the transition from water back to ice.",
    "The student can depict the material (ice) after it has been cooled, showing the reversible change back to a solid state.",
    "The student can label whether the changes in the drawing are reversible, noting the ability to return to the original form (ice to water and back to ice).",
    "The student can use arrows or labels to express cause and effect relationships between heating, cooling, and the state of the material."
