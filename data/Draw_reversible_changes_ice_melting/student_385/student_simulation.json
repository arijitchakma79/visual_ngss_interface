  "Reasoning": "I remember we are supposed to draw ice melting into water. First, I'll start with a shape that looks like ice. I know ice is kind of like a block, so I'll draw a square or a rectangle. I think I should use blue color because ice is cold. Next, I try to show that it melts into water. Um, I'll make some wavy lines underneath the ice shape to show there is water but I’m not sure how to describe the change. I should try drawing an arrow, but I might point it from the block to the water because arrows show direction. Ok, I need to draw some kind of lines for heating, maybe I use orange color for that next to the block, but I don't remember how to show heating properly. I should also try to show freezing, but I don't know how to make ice again from water. I won’t write words because I’m not sure which labels to use. This feels hard, and I'm confused about what's solid or liquid now.",
  "Prompt": "A child's drawing showing a blue, roughly rectangular shape representing ice, with wavy blue lines underneath to indicate water. An orange squiggly line next to the rectangle is intended to show heat, with a single arrow pointing downward from the rectangle to the wavy lines. The drawing is done with crayons and lacks detailed labeling or clear differentiation between states.",
  "Explanation": "The image prompt reflects the student's basic ability to depict a shape resembling ice and an attempt to show transition with wavy lines for water, using incorrect or absent labels. The use of a downward arrow and orange lines reflects confusion in showing the heating process, while the absence of a return from water to ice indicates their struggle in showing reversible change. The crayons used for drawing align with a beginner level, emphasizing simplicity and misunderstanding."
