  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 1,
  "Level Description": "Beginning (minimal or no understanding)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student may draw an object that resembles ice but lacks detail or proper labeling.",
    "The student may attempt to show some elements of the process of change but will not use arrows or labels correctly."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student is unlikely to clearly show the solid state of ice before heating (drawing doesn't differentiate between states).",
    "The student does not accurately depict the transition from ice to water due to heating (transition not represented or incorrect).",
    "The student cannot clearly show water as the end state after heating (liquid state not conveyed).",
    "The student fails to illustrate the cooling process leading back to ice (missing transition or incorrect sequence).",
    "The student does not depict water returning to solid ice clearly after cooling (final state unclear).",
    "The student cannot correctly label reversible changes or indicate the ability for materials to return to original form (absence of labels or incorrect labels).",
    "The student lacks clear cause and effect relationships in the drawing, such as arrows indicating heating and cooling effects (no arrows or incorrect use)."
