  "Reasoning": "I'll draw the ice before it melts, so I start with drawing a box of ice cubes. I remember ice is solid, so it should look square and kind of clear bluish. Then, I need to show the ice melting, so I'll draw a puddle under the cubes with some drips coming off. Iâ€™ll label this part with 'Ice melts to water'. Next, I need to show water turning back into ice. I'll draw a freezer and a tray with the melted water inside, freezing back to solid cubes. I need to label this 'Water freezes to ice'. I'll use arrows to show how the ice melts into water and how water freezes into ice again. I'll try to make sure the arrows point in the right directions and connect the parts of the process, but I might miss connecting a droplet or two. That should show the reversible changes clearly.",
  "Prompt": "Draw a sequence showing reversible changes. Start with an image of a few bluish ice cubes with a label 'solid ice'. Next, show those cubes melting into a puddle with a label 'Ice melts to water'. Include simple, accurate arrows showing the process direction. Then illustrate a tray with water inside a freezer, turning back into ice cubes, labeled 'Water freezes to ice'. Use a simple cartoonish style with clear colors for different states. Ensure all labels and arrows are mostly accurate, even if some droplets or connections might be slightly incomplete.",
  "Explaination": "The image prompt accurately reflects the student's ability to depict phase changes with labels and directional arrows, showing the reversible nature of the process. It also accounts for minor omissions or partially completed elements like droplets, consistent with the student's CAN and CANNOT descriptions at an advanced level."
