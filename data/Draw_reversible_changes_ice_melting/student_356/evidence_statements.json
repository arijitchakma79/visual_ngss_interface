  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Evidence Statements": [
    "The student can draw the material (e.g., ice) before heating, showing its solid state.",
    "The student can illustrate the material after heating, showing how it changes to a liquid (e.g., ice melts into water).",
    "The student can depict the process of cooling the material back into its original state (e.g., showing water freezing back into ice).",
    "The student can label the reversible changes made by heating and cooling to highlight the process of ice turning into water and then back into ice.",
    "The student can use arrows or symbols to show the direction of change when heating and cooling are applied.",
    "The student can include a simple sentence or phrase that describes the cause and effect of heating and cooling on the materialâ€”for instance, 'Ice melts to water' and 'Water freezes to ice'."
