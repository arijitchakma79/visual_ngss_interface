  "Topic": "Draw reversible changes (ice melting)",
  "Code": "2-PS1-4",
  "Level": 4,
  "Level Description": "Advanced (complete and accurate representation of all elements)",
  "CAN": [
    "The student can accurately draw the block of ice before it begins melting, clearly showing the solid state.",
    "The student can draw the melted water after the ice has been heated, depicting the liquid state accurately.",
    "The student can show the refreezing process by drawing the water turning back into ice, indicating the solid state again.",
    "The student can use arrows or clear labels in the drawing to indicate the process of ice melting into water and refreezing back into ice, illustrating the reversibility.",
    "The student can provide a brief caption explaining that the transition from ice to water and back to ice is a reversible change, and why this is the case."
  ],
  "CANNOT": [
    "The student may occasionally leave out minor details like labeling the temperatures at each stage (e.g., freezing point, melting point), though these do not significantly detract from their understanding.",
    "The student might inconsistently apply labels or arrows perfectly, but they will still effectively show the reversible process as intended."
