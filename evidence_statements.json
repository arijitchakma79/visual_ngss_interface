Because this transfer is efficiencies, the amount of energy declines considerably at each step. Organisms harvest only a fraction of the energy available to them and dissipate much as heat. At each successive level of a food web, less matter and energy are contained within the organisms. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of organisms pass through food webs and undergo multiple recycling between living and nonliving parts of the biosphere. At each of these steps, some matter and energy are lost as metabolic waste. At the end of the food web, decomposers recycle nutrients back to the soil (or water) and release carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere.
